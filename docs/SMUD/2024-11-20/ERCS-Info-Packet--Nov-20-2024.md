**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:** Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his designee, to negotiate and execute the following:  

a. A power purchase agreement with Hatchet Ridge Wind, LLC for a 7-year term for 101.2 MW of renewable wind power at an annual approximate cost of $24 million, substantially in the form attached.  

b. A power purchase agreement with SunZia Wind PowerCo, LLC (SunZia) for a 15-year term for 150 MW of renewable wind power at an annual approximate cost of $41 million, substantially in the form attached; and subsequent replacement power purchase agreement(s) with a Pattern Energy, LLC subsidiary to address project investment capital needs, under substantially the same terms and conditions as the SunZia original power purchase agreement.  

**Summary:**  
SMUD received non-binding indications of interest from Pattern Energy, LLC (Pattern) for the Hatchet Ridge Wind and SunZia Wind Projects in 2023. SMUD conducted an evaluation of the market and determined that these projects provided superior value and key solutions compared to available alternatives for meeting our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan and California Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) compliance. SMUD and Pattern negotiated mutually beneficial power purchase agreements (PPAs) under which SMUD will purchase the energy, capacity attributes, and Portfolio Content Category 1 Renewable Energy Credits (PCC RECs). The two PPAs are offered by Pattern as a package deal and are therefore contingent on each other.  

a. Hatchet Ridge Wind Project, owned and operated by Hatchet Ridge Wind, LLC, is located in Northern California and is an existing wind facility interconnected to the California Independent System Operator Corporation (CAISO) grid. The renewable generation project has a capacity of 101.2 MW and will provide approximately 270,000 MWh annually. The contract start date for the PPA is December 14, 2025, and has a term of seven years. The approximate annual cost of the PPA is $24M.  

b. SunZia Wind Project, owned and operated by SunZia Wind PowerCo, LLC, and the associated SunZia Transmission Project, are located in New Mexico and Arizona and will combine to create the largest clean energy infrastructure project in the United States history at more than 3,500 MW split between a northern portion (SunZia North) and southern portion (SunZia South). SMUD’s share of the overall project is 150 MW of capacity which will be part of the CAISO Balancing Authority Area and provide approximately 490,000 MWh annually. The PPA’s expected commercial operation date is April 30, 2026, and has a term of 15 years. The approximate annual cost of the PPA is $41M.  

Given the unique size of the SunZia Wind Project, Pattern intends to separate the project into different portions and sell all or a part of the ownership interests to an outside investor to facilitate capital needs.

(a) From and after the Capacity Attributes Guarantee Date, Seller sells, grants, pledges, assigns and otherwise commits to Buyer all of the Capacity Attributes.

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.8 and Section 3.12, throughout the Delivery Term, Seller shall perform all commercially reasonable actions necessary to ensure that the Facility is eligible to provide Capacity Attributes at the Delivery Point. From and after the Capacity Attributes Guarantee Date, subject to the provisions of this Section 3.8 and Section 3.12, Seller hereby covenants and agrees to transfer all Capacity Attributes to Buyer. Seller shall not commit or encumber any portion of the Facility so as to prevent it from serving as Buyer's Supporting Resource (as defined in the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure Business Rules) and delivering the Guaranteed Capacity Attributes.

(c) Subject to Section 3.12, for the duration of the Delivery Term, Seller shall use good faith efforts, including as set forth in this Section 3.8(c), to comply with requirements in connection with Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity that (i) are instituted by the governing body of Buyer or the CAISO, and (ii) differ from CAISO or CPUC rules applicable to Resource Adequacy Benefits. Seller shall provide to Buyer an attestation, in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, stating that Buyer has procured the Capacity Attributes.

(d) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.8, at Buyer’s reasonable request, Seller shall execute such documents and instruments and take all steps and actions as may be reasonably required to effect recognition and transfer of the Capacity Attributes as belonging to Buyer, and that such request may impose any material additional third-party costs (other than those reimbursed by Buyer pursuant to Section 3.12) or obligations on Seller, or reduce Seller’s compensation hereunder.

(e) Buyer acknowledges that it may be required to take action and obtain certain rights at the Delivery Point in order to make use of the Capacity Attributes, as may be required under applicable Law. If applicable, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to support Buyer’s efforts to (i) obtain any rights that Buyer is required to obtain, or (ii) take any other actions that Buyer is required to take, in each case in order for Buyer to make use of the Capacity Attributes, and in each case as may be required under Applicable Law and as may change from time to time. Buyer’s failure to obtain or maintain any rights or capacities, or take any other actions, necessary to receive or utilize the Capacity Attributes, for reasons other than a Seller failure under this Agreement, shall not be a Seller breach hereunder; any Capacity Attributes, expressed in kW, not delivered to Buyer due to such failure of Buyer shall be defined as “Deemed Delivered Capacity Attributes”. In addition, if any action or inaction of the governing board of Buyer (x) prevents Seller from delivering any Capacity Attributes to Buyer using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with and limited to Seller’s obligations hereunder with respect to Capacity Attributes as of the Effective Date, or (y) disqualifies the Facility from providing Capacity Attributes to Buyer, in whole or in part, all such undelivered or ineligible Capacity Attributes shall constitute Deemed Delivered Capacity Attributes.

To the extent a change in law occurs after execution of this Agreement that causes this representation and warranty to be materially false or misleading, it shall not be an Event of Default if Seller has used commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such change in law.

(b) Applicable Law. This Agreement and the rights and duties of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed, enforced and performed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.

(e) Each of Buyer and Seller acknowledge that this Agreement does not conform to the non-modifiable standard contract term requirements of CPUC decisions 08-04-009, 08-08-028, 10-03-021, 13-11-024, or any successor CPUC decisions thereto. Buyer represents that deliveries of Product under this Agreement are not required to comply with such requirements.

3.11 California Renewables Portfolio Standard. Upon request of Buyer, Seller shall provide records or other information reasonably required to demonstrate that the Product has been conveyed and delivered in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, subject to Section 3.12, scheduling or delivery information necessary to meet the requirements of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard for the Product. Subject to Section 3.12, Seller represents and warrants the Product meets the requirements set forth in PUC Code 399.16(b)(1) and the RPS compliance requirements for Portfolio Content Category 1 as set forth in CPUC Decision 11-12-052.

3.12 Compliance Expenditure Cap. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Seller establishes to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction that a change in Law occurring after the Effective Date has increased Seller’s cost above the cost that could reasonably have been contemplated as of the Effective Date to take all actions to comply with Seller’s obligations under the Agreement with respect to obtaining, maintaining, conveying or effectuating Buyer’s use of (as applicable), the items listed below, then the Parties agree that the maximum amount of costs and expenses Seller shall be required to bear during any Contract Year shall be capped at

(“Compliance Expenditure Cap”)

(a) CEC Certification and Verification;

(b) Green Attributes;

(c) WREGIS; and

(d) Capacity Attributes.

Any actions required for Seller to comply with its obligations set forth in the first paragraph above, the cost of which will be included in the Compliance Expenditure Cap, shall be referred to collectively as the “Compliance Actions.”

If Seller reasonably anticipates the need to incur out-of-pocket expenses in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap in order to take any Compliance Action, Seller shall provide Notice to Buyer of such anticipated out-of-pocket expenses.

Buyer will have ninety (90) days to evaluate such Notice (during which time period Seller is not obligated to take any Compliance Actions described in the Notice) and shall, within such time, either (1) agree to reimburse Seller for all or some portion of the costs that exceed the Compliance Expenditure Cap (such Buyer-agreed upon costs, the “Accepted Compliance Costs”), or (2) waive Seller’s obligation to take such Compliance Actions, or any part thereof, for which Buyer has not agreed to reimburse Seller. If Buyer does not respond to a Notice given by Seller under this Section 3.12 within ninety (90) days after Buyer’s receipt of same, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its rights to require Seller to take the Compliance Actions that are the
<!-- Page 37 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
subject of the Notice, and Seller shall have no further obligations to take, and no liability for a failure to take, such Compliance Actions for the remainder of the Term

; provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right to reconsider Compliance Actions that have been rejected or waived pursuant to this paragraph at any time; provided further, upon Buyer’s written request in connection with such reconsideration, Seller shall provide Notice to Buyer with an updated estimate of the anticipated out-of-pocket expenses to take the reconsidered Compliance Action. Within ninety (90) days after Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s Notice, Buyer shall agree to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs or waive Seller’s obligation to take the reconsidered Compliance Actions, or any part thereof, for which Buyer does not agree to reimburse Seller; provided, if Buyer does not reply within such ninety (90) day period Buyer shall be deemed to have waived Seller’s obligation to take such Compliance Actions.

If Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs, then Seller shall take such Compliance Actions covered by the Accepted Compliance Costs as agreed upon by Buyer and Buyer shall reimburse Seller for Seller’s actual costs to effectuate the Compliance Actions, not to exceed the Accepted Compliance Costs, within sixty (60) days from the time that Buyer receives an invoice and documentation of such costs from Seller. If Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs for less than all of the costs that exceed the Compliance Expenditure Cap, Seller shall only be obligated to take the Compliance Actions covered by the Accepted Compliance Costs.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, any increases in Seller in excess of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) per year to comply with requirements regarding Capacity Attributes (including Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity) established by Buyer, or any Person vested with the authority under applicable Law to require Buyer to procure resource adequacy or other such products, over and above Seller’s costs to comply with CAISO and/or CPUC requirements as to Resource Adequacy Benefits as of the Effective Date (“Buyer Capacity Compliance Costs”), shall be excluded from the Compliance Expenditure Cap. If Buyer desires Seller to comply with any requirements regarding Capacity Attributes (including Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity) that differ from CAISO and/or CPUC requirements as described in the prior sentence, Buyer shall be responsible for payment of all such Buyer Capacity Compliance Costs.

The terms and conditions of this Section 3.12 with respect to Seller expenses in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to all Buyer Capacity Compliance Costs.

(e) A “WREGIS Certificate Deficit” means any deficit or shortfall in WREGIS Certificates delivered to Buyer for a calendar month as compared to the Delivered Energy for the same calendar month (“Deficient Month”). If any WREGIS Certificate Deficit is caused, or the result of any action or inaction, by Seller, then the amount of Delivered Energy in the Deficient Month shall be reduced on a pro rata basis across all Settlement Periods in such Deficient Month by the amount of the WREGIS Certificate Deficit for purposes of calculating Buyer’s payment to Seller under Article 8 and the Guaranteed Energy Production for the applicable Performance Measurement Period; provided, however, that such adjustment shall not apply to the extent that after the ninety (90) days attributed to the delay in the creation of WREGIS Certificates for such Deficient Month, Seller either (x) resolves the WREGIS Certificate Deficit within an additional one hundred eighty (180) days or (y) provides Replacement Green Attributes within an additional one hundred eighty (180) days (i) upon a schedule reasonably acceptable to Buyer and (ii) provided that such deliveries do not impose additional costs upon Buyer for which Seller refuses to provide reimbursement. If the amount of Delivered Energy in the Deficient Month is reduced in accordance with the prior sentence and neither (x) nor (y) of the prior sentence apply, Buyer shall pay Seller for any Delivered Energy that is delivered by Seller without corresponding WREGIS Certificates at a price equal to the lesser of (i) the Contract Price, or (ii) the LMP in the Day-Ahead Market at the Delivery Point, and for purposes of the Guaranteed Energy Production, Delivered Energy is reduced by the amount of the WREGIS Certificate Deficit for the applicable Performance Measurement Period. Without limiting Seller’s obligations under this Section 4.8, if a WREGIS Certificate Deficit is caused solely by an error or omission of WREGIS, Delivered Energy shall not be reduced pursuant to this Section 4.8(e) and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to cause WREGIS to correct its error or omission.

(f) If WREGIS changes the WREGIS Operating Rules after the Effective Date or applies the WREGIS Operating Rules in a manner inconsistent with this Section 4.8 after the Effective Date, the Parties promptly shall modify this Section 4.8 as reasonably required to cause and enable Seller to transfer to Buyer’s WREGIS Account a quantity of WREGIS Certificates for each given calendar month that corresponds to the Delivered Energy in the same calendar month.

4.9 Standard of Care. Seller shall be responsible for designing, installing, operating, and maintaining the Facility (including all associated costs) in accordance with all applicable Law, and shall comply with all applicable WECC, RC West, FERC and NERC requirements, and with Prudent Operating Practice, including applicable interconnection and telemetering requirements set forth in the Interconnection Agreement.

Seller shall ensure that: (a) operation and maintenance of the Project is conducted in a safe manner in accordance with the Interconnection Agreement and Prudent Industry Practice; and (b) any governmental authorizations and permits required for the operation thereof are maintained. Consistent with (a) above, Seller shall ensure that any necessary and commercially reasonable repairs are made to the Facility.

Seller acknowledges receipt of SMUD’s Principles of Renewable Energy Development as expressed in Exhibit M, attached and incorporated herein. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to abide by the project-specific obligations identified in the “Communities Benefits Plan” as further described in Exhibit M, to the extent applicable to and feasible for the Facility as reasonably determined by Seller.

## TAXES  

5.1 **Allocation of Taxes and Charges.** Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the Facility or on or with respect to the sale and delivery of Product to Buyer, that are imposed on Product prior to the Delivery Point. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the delivery to and purchase by Buyer of the Product that are imposed on Product at and from the Delivery Point (other than withholding or other Taxes imposed on Seller’s income, revenue, receipts or employees). If a Party is required to remit or pay Taxes that are the other Party’s responsibility hereunder, such Party shall promptly pay the Taxes due and then seek and receive reimbursement from the other for such Taxes. In the event any sale of Product hereunder is exempt from or not subject to any particular Tax, the exempted Party shall provide the other Party with all necessary documentation within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date to evidence such exemption or exclusion. If the exempted Party does not provide such documentation, then such Party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party from any liability with respect to Taxes from which the exempted Party claims it is exempt.  

5.2 **Cooperation.** Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to implement the provisions of and administer this Agreement in accordance with the intent of the Parties to minimize all Taxes, so long as no Party is materially adversely affected by such efforts. The Parties shall cooperate to minimize Tax exposure; provided, however, that neither Party shall be obligated to incur any financial or operational burden to reduce Taxes for which the other Party is responsible hereunder without receiving due compensation therefor from the other Party. All Energy delivered by Seller to Buyer hereunder shall be a sale made at wholesale, with Buyer reselling such Energy.  

# ARTICLE 6  
## MAINTENANCE OF THE FACILITY

**ARTICLE 7  
METERING**

7.1 **Metering.** Seller shall measure the amount of Delivered Energy produced by the Facility using an Approved Meter. The Approved Meter shall be installed at the switching station PG&E’s Pit #3 – Round Mountain 230 kV Line and maintained at Seller’s cost. If the Approved Meter is inaccurate, Seller will cause such meter to be promptly corrected in accordance with Prudent Operating Practice and CAISO requirements. Seller will be responsible for any costs, fines or penalties, including imbalance charges as a result of the inaccurate meter. The meter shall be kept under seal, such seals to be broken only when the meters are to be tested, adjusted, modified or relocated. In the event that Seller breaks a seal, Seller shall notify Buyer as soon as practicable. In addition, Seller hereby agrees to provide all Approved Meter data to Buyer in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and consents to Buyer obtaining from CAISO the meter data applicable to the Facility and all inspection, testing and calibration data and reports. Seller, or Seller’s Scheduling Coordinator, shall cooperate with Buyer to allow both Parties to retrieve the meter reads from the CAISO Market Results Interface – Settlements (MRIS-S) (or its successor).

7.2 **Meter Verification.** Annually, if Seller has reason to believe there may be a meter malfunction, or upon Buyer’s reasonable request, Seller shall test the meter. The tests shall be conducted by independent third parties qualified to conduct such tests at Seller’s expense; provided, if the meter is tested at Buyer’s request and is determined to be accurate, the costs of such test shall be borne by Buyer. If practical, Buyer shall be notified seven (7) days in advance of such tests and have a right to be present during such tests. If a meter is inaccurate it shall be promptly repaired or replaced. If a meter is inaccurate by more than one percent (1%) and it is not known when the meter inaccuracy commenced (if such evidence exists such date will be used to adjust prior invoices), then the invoices covering the period of time since the last meter test shall be adjusted for the amount of the inaccuracy on the assumption that the inaccuracy persisted during the second half of such period.

**ARTICLE 8  
INVOICING AND PAYMENT; CREDIT**

8.1 **Invoicing.** Seller shall deliver an invoice to Buyer no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the prior monthly delivery period; provided that Seller’s failure to deliver an invoice to Buyer by such deadline shall not be a breach hereunder. Each invoice shall provide Buyer (a) records of metered data, including metering and CAISO transaction data sufficient to document and verify the amount of Delivered Energy for each Settlement Period during the preceding month, including the amount of Delivered Energy as set forth in the first CAISO settlement statement for the prior month that includes meter data from the Approved Meter, the applicable Contract Price, deviations between the Scheduled Energy and the Delivered Energy, the LMP in the Real-Time Market at the Delivery Point for each Settlement Period; (b) hourly meter data, plus any additional data as may be reasonably required by Buyer for compliance with CPUC reporting obligations, including pursuant to the CPUC’s Energy Division Portfolio Content Category Classification Review Handbook (or successor publication); (c) a statement of

the quantity of WREGIS Certificates transferred during the prior month; (d) access to any records, including invoices or settlement data from the CAISO, necessary to verify the accuracy of any amount; and (e) be in a reasonable format covering the services provided in the preceding month determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

8.2 Payment. Buyer shall make payment to Seller by wire transfer or ACH payment to the bank account provided on each monthly invoice. Buyer shall pay undisputed invoice amounts within thirty (30) days after receipt of the invoice. If such due date falls on a weekend, local business holiday observed by either Party, or a NERC holiday, such due date shall be the next Business Day. Payments made after the due date will be considered late and will bear interest on the unpaid balance. If the amount due is not paid on or before the due date or if any other payment that is due and owing from one party to another is not paid on or before its applicable due date, a late payment charge shall be applied to the unpaid balance and shall be added to the next billing statement. Such late payment charge shall be calculated based on an annual Interest Rate equal to the prime rate published on the date of the invoice in The Wall Street Journal (or, if The Wall Street Journal is not published on that day, the next succeeding date of publication), plus two percent (2%) (the “Interest Rate”). If the due date occurs on a day that is not a Business Day, the late payment charge shall begin to accrue on the next succeeding Business Day.

8.3 Books and Records. To facilitate payment and verification, each Party shall maintain all books and records necessary for billing and payments, including copies of all invoices under this Agreement, for a period of at least two (2) years or as otherwise required by Law. Upon fifteen (15) days’ Notice to Seller, Buyer shall be granted reasonable access to the accounting books and records pertaining to all invoices generated pursuant to this Agreement.

8.4 Payment Adjustments; Billing Errors. Payment adjustments shall be made if Buyer or Seller discovers there have been good faith inaccuracies in invoicing that are not otherwise disputed under Section 8.5, there is determined to have been a meter inaccuracy sufficient to require a payment adjustment, or if CAISO recalculates amounts due or owing in respect of prior periods. If the required adjustment is in favor of Buyer, Buyer’s monthly payment shall be credited in an amount equal to the adjustment. If the required adjustment is in favor of Seller, Seller shall add the adjustment amount to Buyer’s next monthly invoice. Other than recalculations by CAISO, adjustments in favor of either Buyer or Seller shall bear interest, until settled in full, in accordance with Section 8.2, accruing from the date on which the non-erring Party received Notice thereof.

8.5 Billing Disputes. A Party may, in good faith, dispute the correctness of any invoice or any adjustment to an invoice rendered under this Agreement or adjust any invoice for any arithmetic or computational error within twelve (12) months of the date the invoice, or adjustment to an invoice, was rendered. In the event an invoice or portion thereof, or any other claim or adjustment arising hereunder, is disputed, payment of the undisputed portion of the invoice shall be required to be made when due. Any invoice dispute or invoice adjustment shall be in writing and shall state the basis for the dispute or adjustment. Payment of the disputed amount shall not be required until the dispute is resolved. Upon resolution of the dispute, any required payment shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of such resolution along with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the original due date to but excluding the date paid. Inadvertent overpayments shall be returned upon request or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment.

from subsequent payments, with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the date of such overpayment but excluding the date repaid or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment. Any dispute with respect to an invoice is waived if the other Party is not notified in accordance with this Section 8.5 within twelve (12) months after the invoice is rendered or subsequently adjusted, except to the extent any misinformation was from a third party not affiliated with any Party and such third party corrects its information after the twelve-month period. If an invoice is not rendered within twelve (12) months after the close of the month during which performance occurred, the right to payment for such performance is waived.

8.6 Netting of Payments. The Parties hereby agree that they shall discharge mutual debts and payment obligations due and owing to each other on the same date through netting, in which case all undisputed amounts owed by each Party to the other Party for the purchase and sale of Product during the monthly billing period under this Agreement or otherwise arising out of this Agreement, including any related damages calculated pursuant to Exhibits B and E, interest, and payments or credits, including pursuant to Section 4.3(c), shall be netted so that only the excess amount remaining due shall be paid by the Party who owes the remaining amount.

8.7 Seller’s Pre-CSD Security. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall deliver Pre-CSD Security to Buyer within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date. Seller shall maintain the Pre-CSD Security in full force and effect. Upon the earlier of (A) Seller’s delivery of the Performance Security, or (B) sixty (60) days after termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall return the Pre-CSD Security to Seller, less the amounts drawn in accordance with this Agreement. If and to the extent that any portion of the Pre-CSD Security is drawn by the issuer of such Letter of Credit (i) fails to maintain a Credit Rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s, (ii) indicates its intent not to renew such Letter of Credit and such Credit expires prior to Contract Start Date, (iii) fails to honor Buyer’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit, or (iv) becomes Bankrupt, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to post substitute collateral that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Pre-CSD Security. Seller shall have no obligation to replenish the Pre-CSD Security following any draws thereon by Buyer. Seller’s maximum liability for an Event of Default or failure to perform its obligations hereunder prior to the Contract Start Date shall be capped at the amount of the Pre-CSD Security, less any amounts collected by Buyer prior to such Event of Default or failure to perform.

8.8 Seller’s Performance Security. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall deliver Performance Security to Buyer on or before the Contract Start Date. Seller shall maintain the Performance Security in full force and effect until the following have occurred: (A) the Delivery Term has expired or terminated early; and (B) all payment obligations of the Seller arising under this Agreement, including compensation for penalties, Termination Payment, indemnification payments or other damages are paid in full (whether directly or indirectly such as through set-off or netting). Following the occurrence of both events, Buyer shall promptly return to Seller the unused portion of the Performance Security. If and to the extent that any portion of the Performance Security is a Letter of Credit and the issuer of such Letter of Credit (i) fails to maintain a Credit Rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s, (ii) fails to honor Buyer’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit, or (iii) becomes Bankrupt, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to post substitute collateral that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Performance Security.

![Financial Statements](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Financial+Statements)

8.9 Financial Statements.

(a) If requested, Buyer shall provide to Seller (i) within one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of each fiscal year during the Contract Term, a copy of Buyer’s annual report containing audited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal year and (ii) within sixty (60) days after the end of each of its first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year during the Contract Term, a copy of Buyer’s quarterly report containing unaudited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal quarter. In all cases the statements shall be for the most recent accounting period and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”); provided, however, that should any such statements not be available on a timely basis due to a delay in preparation or certifications, such unavailability shall not be an Event of Default so long as Buyer diligently pursues the preparation, certification, and delivery of the statements.

8.10 Buyer’s First Priority Security Interest in Cash or Cash Equivalent Collateral.  
To secure its obligations under this Agreement, and until released as provided herein, Seller hereby grants to Buyer a present and continuing first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), and assignment of the Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, any other cash collateral and cash equivalent collateral posted by Seller pursuant to Sections 8.7 and 8.8, and any and all interest thereon or proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof, whether now or hereafter held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of Buyer, and Seller agrees to take all action as Buyer reasonably requires in order to perfect Buyer’s first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), such collateral and any and all proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof.

Upon or any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default caused by Seller, an Early Termination Date resulting from an Event of Default caused by Seller, or an occasion provided for in this Agreement where Buyer is authorized to retain all or a portion of the Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, Buyer may do any one or more of the following (in each case subject to the final sentence of this Section 8.10 and the provisions of Article 12):

(a) Exercise any of its rights and remedies with respect to the Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, as applicable, including any such rights and remedies under Law then in effect;  
(b) Draw on any outstanding Letter of Credit issued for its benefit and retain any cash held by Buyer as Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, as applicable; and  
(c) Liquidate all Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, as applicable then held by or for the benefit of Buyer free from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of Seller, including any equity or right of purchase or redemption by Seller.

Buyer shall apply the proceeds of the collateral realized upon the exercise of any such rights or remedies to reduce Seller’s obligations under this Agreement (Seller remains liable for any amounts owing to Buyer after such application), subject to Buyer’s obligation to return any surplus proceeds remaining after these obligations are satisfied in full.

**ARTICLE 10  
FORCE MAJEURE**

10.1 **Definition.**

(a) “Force Majeure Event” means any act or event that delays or prevents a Party from timely performing all or a portion of its obligations under this Agreement or from complying with all or a portion of the conditions under this Agreement if such act or event, which event or circumstance, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, cannot be avoided by and is beyond the reasonable control (whether direct or indirect) of and without the fault or negligence of the Party relying thereon as justification for such delay, nonperformance or noncompliance.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, so long as the following events, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, cannot be avoided by, and are beyond the reasonable control (whether direct or indirect) of and without the fault or negligence of the Party relying thereon as justification for such delay, nonperformance or noncompliance, a Force Majeure Event may include an act of God or the elements, such as flooding, lightning, hurricanes, tornadoes, or ice storms; explosion; fire; volcanic eruption; flood; epidemic, or pandemic, including COVID-19 (but only to the extent that new governmental rules or mandates related to COVID-19 are implemented that were not in place as of the Effective Date); landslide; mudslide; sabotage; terrorism; earthquake; or other cataclysmic events; an act of public enemy; acts or failure to act by a Governmental Authority; war; blockade; civil insurrection; riot; civil disturbance; Serial Defect; or strikes or other labor difficulties caused or suffered by a Party or any third party except as set forth below.

<!-- Page 51 -->
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Force Majeure Event” does not include (i) economic conditions that render a Party’s performance of this Agreement at the Contract Price unprofitable or otherwise uneconomic (including Buyer’s ability to buy Energy at a lower price, or Seller’s ability to sell Energy generated by the Facility at a higher price, than the Contract Price); (ii) Seller’s inability to obtain permits or approvals of any type for the construction, operation, or maintenance of the Facility, except to the extent such inability is caused by a Force Majeure Event; (iii) the inability of a Party to make payments when due under this Agreement; (iv) a Curtailment Order, except to the extent that a Curtailment Order is caused by an event that otherwise qualifies as a Force Majeure Event; (v) Seller’s inability to obtain sufficient labor, equipment, materials, or other resources to build or operate the Facility except to the extent such inability is caused by a Force Majeure Event; (vi) a strike, work stoppage or labor dispute limited only to any one or more of Seller, Seller’s Affiliates, Seller’s contractors, their subcontractors thereof or any other third party employed by Seller to work on the Facility; (vii) any equipment failure except if such equipment failure is caused by a Force Majeure Event; or (viii) except as the Guaranteed Contract Start Date may be extended as a result of a Permitted Extension, Seller’s inability to achieve Contract Start Date following the Guaranteed Contract Start Date.

10.2 No Liability If a Force Majeure Event Occurs. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall be liable to the other Party in the event it is prevented from performing its obligations hereunder in whole or in part due to a Force Majeure Event. The Party rendered unable to fulfill any obligation by reason of a Force Majeure Event shall take reasonable actions necessary to remove such inability with due speed and diligence. Nothing herein shall be construed as permitting that Party to continue to fail to perform after said cause has been removed. The obligation to use due speed and diligence shall not be interpreted to require resolution of labor disputes by acceding to demands of the opposition when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the Party having such difficulty. Neither Party shall be considered in breach or default of this Agreement if and to the extent that any failure or delay in the Party’s performance of one or more of its obligations hereunder is caused by a Force Majeure Event. The occurrence and continuation of a Force Majeure Event shall not suspend or excuse the obligation of a Party to make any payments due hereunder. Any delays caused by a Force Majeure Event will not serve to increase the Contract Term nor Contract Price of this Agreement.

10.3 Notice. In the event of any delay or nonperformance resulting from a Force Majeure Event, the Party suffering the Force Majeure Event shall (a) as soon as practicable, notify the other Party in writing of the nature, cause, estimated date of commencement thereof, the anticipated extent of any delay or interruption in performance, and, to the extent reasonably practicable, a mitigation plan for limiting or overcoming the impacts of the Force Majeure Event and (b) notify the other Party in writing of the cessation or termination of such Force Majeure Event, all as known or estimated in good faith by the affected Party; provided, however, that a Party’s failure to give timely Notice as provided in this Section 10.3 shall not affect such Party’s ability to assert that a Force Majeure Event has occurred unless the delay in giving Notice materially prejudices the other Party.

10.4 Termination Following Force Majeure Event. If a Force Majeure Event has occurred after the Contract Start Date that has caused either Party to be unable to perform its material obligations hereunder, and has continued for a consecutive twelve (12) month period, then, the

the non-claiming Party may terminate this Agreement upon Notice to the other Party experiencing the Force Majeure Event; provided that if Seller is the Party claiming such Force Majeure Event and such Force Majeure Event cannot reasonably be cured within such twelve (12) month period, then Seller may provide a plan to Buyer, which must be acceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion, to cure such Force Majeure Event within an additional consecutive six (6) month period and Buyer may not terminate this Agreement due to such Force Majeure Event unless Seller has not resumed performance of its material obligations hereunder upon the expiration of such additional consecutive six (6) month period. Upon any such termination, the non-claiming Party shall have no liability to the Party claiming Force Majeure Event, save and except for those obligations specified in Section 2.1(b).

**ARTICLE 11**  
**DEFAULTS; REMEDIES; TERMINATION**

(vii) such Party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to, another entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer, the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume all the obligations of such Party under this Agreement by operation of Law or pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the other Party.

(b) with respect to Seller as the Defaulting Party, the occurrence of any of the following:

(i) except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time, Seller delivers or attempts to deliver Energy to the Delivery Point for sale under this Agreement that was not generated by the Facility; or

(ii) with respect to any outstanding Letter of Credit provided for the benefit of Buyer that is not then required under this Agreement to be canceled or returned, the failure by Seller to provide for the benefit of Buyer either (1) cash, or (2) a replacement surety bond (solely with respect to the Performance Security), or (3) a substitute Letter of Credit from a different issuer meeting the criteria set forth in the definition of Letter of Credit, in each case, in the amount required hereunder within ten (10) Business Days after Seller receives Notice of the occurrence of any of the following events:

(B) the issuer of such Letter of Credit becomes Bankrupt;

(G) Seller shall fail to renew or cause the renewal of each outstanding Letter of Credit on a timely basis as provided in the relevant Credit of Seller, provided in accordance with this Agreement, and in no event less than sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the outstanding Letter of Credit.

11.2 Remedies; Declaration of Early Termination Date. If an Event of Default with respect to a Defaulting Party shall have occurred and be continuing, the other Party (“Non-Defaulting Party”) shall have the following rights:

(a) to send Notice, designating a day, no earlier than the day such Notice is deemed to be received and no later than twenty (20) days after such Notice is deemed to be received, as an early termination date of this Agreement (“Early Termination Date”) that terminates this Agreement (the “Terminated Transaction”) and ends the Contract Term effective as of the Early Termination Date;

(b) to accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties, and to collect as liquidated damages (i) the Damage Payment (in the case of an Event of Default by Seller occurring before the Contract Start Date) or (ii) the Termination Payment calculated in accordance with Section 11.3 below (in the case of any other Event of Default by Seller after the Contract Start Date or by Buyer throughout the Contract Term);

(c) to withhold any payments due to the Defaulting Party under this Agreement;

(d) to suspend performance; and

(e) to exercise any other right or remedy available at Law or in equity, including specific performance or injunctive relief, except to the extent such remedies are expressly limited under this Agreement;

provided, that payment by the Defaulting Party of the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, shall constitute liquidated damages and the Non-Defaulting Party’s sole and exclusive remedy for the Terminated Transaction and the Event of Default related thereto. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller’s sole and aggregate liability under or arising out of a termination of this Agreement prior to the Contract Start Date shall be limited to the amount required to be posted as Pre-CSD Security pursuant to Section 8.7, less any amounts collected by Buyer prior to such Early Termination Date.

11.3 Termination Payment. The termination payment (“Termination Payment”) for a Terminated Transaction shall be the aggregate of all Settlement Amounts plus any all other amounts due to the Non-Defaulting Party netted into a single amount. If the Non-Defaulting Party’s aggregate Gains exceed its aggregate Losses and Costs, if any, resulting from the termination of this Agreement, the net Settlement Amount shall be zero. The Non-Defaulting Party shall calculate, in a commercially reasonable manner, a Settlement Amount for the Terminated Transaction as of the Early Termination Date. Third parties (which shall not include Affiliates of the Non-Defaulting Party) supplying information for purposes of the calculation of Gains or Losses may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors and other sources of market information. The Settlement Amount shall not include consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary, indirect or business interruption damages; provided, however, that any lost Capacity Attributes and Green Attributes shall be deemed direct damages covered by this Agreement. Without prejudice to the Non-Defaulting Party’s duty to mitigate, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not have to enter into replacement transactions to establish a Settlement Amount. Each Party agrees and acknowledges that (a) the actual damages that the Non-Defaulting Party would incur in connection with a Terminated Transaction would be difficult or impossible to predict with certainty, (b) the Damage Payment or Termination Payment described in Section 11.2 or this Section 11.3 (as applicable) is a reasonable and appropriate approximation of such damages, and (c) the Damage Payment or

![Termination Payment](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Termination+Payment+Document)

Termination Payment described in Section 11.2 or this Section 11.3 (as applicable) is the exclusive remedy of the Non-Defaulting Party in connection with a Terminated Transaction but shall not otherwise act to limit any of the Non-Defaulting Party’s rights or remedies if the Non-Defaulting Party does not elect a Terminated Transaction as its remedy for an Event of Default by the Defaulting Party.

11.4 Notice of Payment of Termination Payment. As soon as practicable after a Terminated Transaction, Notice shall be given by the Non-Defaulting Party to the Defaulting Party of the amount of the Termination Payment and whether the Termination Payment is due to the Non-Defaulting Party. The Notice shall include a written statement explaining in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount and the sources for such calculation. The Termination Payment shall be made to the Non-Defaulting Party, as applicable, within ten (10) Business Days after such Notice is effective.

11.5 Disputes With Respect to Termination Payment. If the Defaulting Party disputes the Non-Defaulting Party’s calculation of the Termination Payment, in whole or in part, the Defaulting Party shall, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Non-Defaulting Party’s calculation of the Termination Payment, provide to the Non-Defaulting Party a detailed written explanation of the basis for such dispute. Disputes regarding the Termination Payment shall be determined in accordance with Article 15.

11.6 Rights And Remedies Are Cumulative. Except where liquidated damages are provided as the exclusive remedy, the rights and remedies of a Party under this article 11 shall be cumulative and in addition to the rights of the Parties otherwise provided in this Agreement.

11.7 Mitigation. Any Non-Defaulting Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its Costs, Losses and damages resulting from any Event of Default of the other Party under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 12
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES

12.1 No Consequential Damages. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PART OF AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER OR ITS INDEMNIFIED PERSONS FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOSSES OR DAMAGES FOR LOST REVENUE OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE.

REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE DEEMED TO “FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE” OR ARE OTHERWISE HELD TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, IF THERE IS AN EARLY TERMINATION DATE PRIOR TO THE CONTRACT START DATE, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF SELLER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT REQUIRED TO BE POSTED AS PRE-CSD SECURITY PURSUANT TO SECTION 8.7, LESS ANY AMOUNTS COLLECTED BY BUYER PRIOR TO SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE.

FOR BREACH OF ANY PROVISION FOR WHICH AN EXPRESS AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS PROVIDED, SUCH EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, THE OBLIGOR’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED AS SET FORTH IN SUCH PROVISION, AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED.

15.2 Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dispute arising under this Agreement, within ten (10) days following the receipt of a Notice from either Party identifying such dispute, the Parties shall meet, negotiate and attempt, in good faith, to resolve the dispute quickly, informally and inexpensively.

ARTICLE 16
INDEMNIFICATION

16.1 Indemnification.

(a) Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, representatives and agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Party”) from and against all third-party claims, demands, losses, liabilities, penalties, and expenses and expert witness fees (collectively “Indemnifiable Event”), to the extent such Indemnifiable Event arises out of, results from, or is caused by any of the following: (a) the negligent act or omission, recklessness or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party, its Affiliates, its or their directors, officers, employees, agents, subcontractors, and anyone directly or indirectly employed by the Indemnifying Party or any of its subcontractors or anyone that they control; or (b) any violation of applicable Law by the Indemnifying Party, in each case in connection with this Agreement. Upon the Indemnified Party’s written request, the Indemnifying Party, at its own expense, must defend any suit or action that is subject to the Indemnifying Party’s indemnity obligations.

(b) Nothing in this Section 16.1 shall enlarge or relieve Seller or Buyer of any liability to the other for any breach of this Agreement. Neither Party shall be indemnified for its damages resulting to the extent of its own negligence, intentional acts, or willful misconduct. These indemnity provisions shall not be construed to relieve any insurer of its obligation to pay claims consistent with the provisions of a valid insurance policy.

16.2 Claims. Promptly after receipt by a Party of any claim or Notice of the indemnity provided for in this Article 16 may apply, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such fact. The Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof with counsel designated by such Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to, or inconsistent with, those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select and be represented by separate counsel, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, unless a liability insurer is willing to pay such costs. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of a claim meriting indemnification, the Indemnified Party may at the expense of the Indemnifying Party contest, settle, or pay such claim, provided that settlement or full payment of any such claim may be made only following consent of the Indemnifying Party or, absent such consent, written opinion of the Indemnified Party’s counsel that such claim is meritorious or warrants settlement.

<!-- Page 61 -->
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence if the settlement consists solely of a monetary payment by the Indemnifying Party, such settlement shall not require the consent of the Indemnifying Party. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 16, in the event that a Party is obligated to indemnify and hold the other Party and its successors and assigns harmless under this Article 16, the amount owing to the Indemnified Party will be the amount of the Indemnified Party’s damages net of any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party following a reasonable effort by the Indemnified Party to obtain such insurance proceeds.

# ARTICLE 17
## INSURANCE

### 17.1 Insurance.

(a) **General Liability.** Seller shall maintain, or cause to be maintained at its sole expense, (i) commercial general liability insurance against claims for personal injury (including bodily injury and death) and property damage with a limit of liability of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence, and a general aggregate of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for combined bodily injury and property damage; and (ii) an umbrella insurance policy in a minimum limit of liability of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). The amounts of liability insurance described in this Article 17 may be satisfied by primary insurance or by any combination of primary and excess/umbrella insurance. Such insurance shall contain standard cross-liability and severability of interest provisions such that each person is protected in the same manner as though a separate policy has been issued to each but nothing therein shall operate to increase the insurance company’s liability beyond the amount the insurance company would have been liable if only one Person or interest had been named as insured. The liability insurance policies referenced in this Article 17 shall (x) provide an endorsement waiving rights of subrogation against Buyer, (y) name Buyer as additional insured on all required liability insurance (except workers compensation), and (z) be primary to any insurance of Buyer that may apply to such occurrence, accident or claim and no “other insurance” provision shall be applicable to Buyer or any additional insureds, by virtue of having been named an additional insured under any policy of insurance.

(b) **Workers Compensation and Employer’s Liability.** Employers’ Liability insurance shall not be less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) providing statutory benefits as required by Law (if any exposure exists) for injury, sickness, disability or death of the employees.

(c) **Business Auto Liability Insurance.** Seller shall maintain at all times during the Contract Term business auto insurance for bodily injury and property damage with limits of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit. Such insurance shall cover liability arising out of Seller’s use of all owned (if any), non-owned and hired motor vehicles in the performance of the Agreement.

(d) **Property Insurance.** Seller shall maintain or cause to be maintained property insurance covering the Facility against physical loss or damage, including coverage for natural perils including but not limited to flood, earthquake, windstorm, severe convective storm, and wildfire, all with limits in accordance with industry standard recognizing that natural perils may.

be subject to a lower sublimit. Coverage will be on an "all-risk" basis including mechanical and electrical breakdown.

(e) Documentation. Before commencing work under this Agreement, Seller’s broker or agent shall provide certificates of insurance verifying that at least the minimum insurance coverages required above are in effect with additional insured, waiver of subrogation and any other policy provisions or endorsements include, as applicable. Acceptance of the evidence of coverage by Buyer shall not relieve or decrease the extent to which Seller may be held responsible for payment of damages resulting from Seller’s services or operations pursuant to this Agreement, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Buyer’s rights to insurance coverage hereunder. Failure to demand evidence of full compliance with the insurance requirements set forth in this Agreement or failure to identify any insurance deficiency shall not relieve Seller from, nor be construed or deemed a waiver of, its obligation to maintain the required insurance at all times during the performance of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 18  
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

18.1 Definition of Confidential Information. The following constitutes "Confidential Information," whether oral or written which is delivered by Seller to Buyer or by Buyer to Seller from Buyer in connection with the terms and conditions of, and proposals and negotiations related to, this Agreement, and (b) information that either Seller or Buyer stamps or otherwise identifies as "confidential" or "proprietary" before disclosing it to the other. Confidential Information does not include (i) information that was publicly available at the time of the disclosure, other than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Agreement; (ii) information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the recipient after the time of the delivery; (iii) information that was rightfully in the possession of the recipient (without confidential or proprietary restriction) at the time of delivery or that becomes available to the recipient from a source not subject to any restriction against disclosing such information to the recipient; and (iv) information that the recipient independently developed without a violation of this Agreement.

If the Receiving Party becomes legally compelled (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas, summons, civil investigative demands, or similar processes or otherwise in connection with any litigation or to comply with any applicable Law, order, regulation, ruling, regulatory request, accounting disclosure rule or standard or any exchange, control area or independent system operator rule) to disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party (the "Disclosing Party"), Receiving Party shall provide Disclosing Party with prompt notice so that Disclosing Party, at its sole expense, may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy.

18.3 Irreparable Injury; Remedies. Receiving Party acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are necessary and reasonable in order to protect Disclosing Party and the business of Disclosing Party, and expressly acknowledges that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate Disclosing Party for any breach or threatened breach by Receiving Party of any covenants and agreements set forth herein.

18.4 Permitted Disclosures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 18, Confidential Information may be disclosed by either Party to such Party’s counsel, accountants, auditors, advisors, other professional consultants, credit rating agencies, Affiliates or actual or prospective owners, investors, lenders, directors, underwriters, contractors, suppliers or others involved in the construction, operation and financing transactions and arrangements for a Party or its affiliates, or any of its or their agents, consultants or trustees, so long as the Person to whom Confidential Information is disclosed agrees in writing to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Article 18 to the same extent as if it were a Party, or is bound by substantially similar confidentiality requirements.

ARTICLE 19 MISCELLANEOUS

19.1 Entire Agreement; Integration; Exhibits. This Agreement, together with the Cover Sheet and Exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between Seller and Buyer with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to the subject matter hereof, which are of no further force or effect.

19.4 No Agency, Partnership, Joint Venture or Lease. Seller and the agents and employees of Seller shall, in the performance of this Agreement, act in an independent capacity and not as officers or employees or agents of Buyer.

Changes proposed by a non-Party or FERC acting sua sponte shall be subject to the most stringent standard permissible under applicable Law.

# EXHIBIT B  
## CONTRACT START DATE  

1. **Reserved.**  

2. **Contract Start.** “Contract Start” means the condition existing when (i) Seller has fulfilled all of the conditions in Section 2.3 of the Agreement and (ii) Seller has confirmed to Buyer in writing that Contract Start has been achieved.  

   The “Contract Start Date” shall be the date on which Contract Start is achieved.  
   
   a. Seller shall use good faith efforts to cause the Contract Start Date to occur by the Guaranteed Contract Start Date. Seller shall notify Buyer at least thirty (30) days before the anticipated Contract Start Date.  
   
   b. If Seller does not anticipate achieving Contract Start by the Guaranteed Contract Start Date, Seller may elect to extend the Guaranteed Contract Start Date by paying Delay Damages to Buyer for each day Seller desires to extend the Guaranteed Contract Start Date. If Seller elects to extend the Guaranteed Contract Start Date, on or before the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the then-current Guaranteed Contract Start Date, Seller shall provide Notice and payment to Buyer of the Delay Damages for the number of days of extension to the Guaranteed Contract Start Date (“Delay Damages Payment”); provided such Delay Damages Payment may, at Seller’s option, be in the form of cash or an irrevocable, standby letter of credit issued by a U.S. commercial bank, or a foreign bank with a U.S. branch, with such bank having a Credit Rating of at least A- with an outlook designation of “stable” from S&P or A3 with an outlook designation of “stable” from Moody’s, which letter of credit Buyer may draw on to receive such Delay Damages Payment. If Seller achieves Contract Start prior to the Guaranteed Contract Start Date as extended by the payment of the Delay Damages Payment, Buyer shall refund to Seller in cash the Delay Damages for each day Seller achieves Contract Start prior to the Guaranteed Contract Start Date, as extended, times the Delay Damages, not to exceed the total amount of the Delay Damages Payment paid by Seller pursuant to this Section 2(b). The Parties agree that Buyer’s receipt of Delay Damages shall not be construed as Buyer’s declaration that an Event of Default has occurred under any provision of Section 11.1.  

3. **Termination for Failure to Achieve Contract Start.** If the Facility has not achieved Contract Start by the Outside Contract Start Date, either Party may elect to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 2.6.  

4. **Extension of the Guaranteed Dates.** The Guaranteed Contract Start Date shall, subject to notice and documentation requirements set forth below, be automatically extended on a day-for-day basis (the “Permitted Extension”) for the following delays:  
   
   a. delays due to a Force Majeure Event;

![EXHIBIT E ENERGY REPLACEMENT DAMAGES CALCULATION](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=EXHIBIT+E+ENERGY+REPLACEMENT+DAMAGES+CALCULATION)

In accordance with Section 4.7, if Seller fails to achieve the Guaranteed Energy Production during any Performance Measurement Period, and Seller elects to not provide Replacement Product, a liquidated damages (“Energy Replacement Damages”) payment shall be due from Seller to Buyer, calculated as follows:

[(A - B) * (C - D)] - E

where:

A = the Guaranteed Energy Production amount for the Performance Measurement Period, in MWh

B = the Adjusted Energy Production amount for the Performance Measurement Period, in MWh

C = Replacement price for the Performance Measurement Period, in $/MWh, which is the sum of (a) the simple average of the LMP in the Day-Ahead Market at the Delivery Point for all of the hours in the Performance Measurement Period, plus (b) the simple average REC Price for the applicable Performance Measurement Period.

D = the Contract Price, in $/MWh

E = the value of any Replacement Product provided retrospectively by Seller with respect to such Performance Measurement Period

“Adjusted Energy Production” shall mean the sum of the following: (i) the greater of (a) if Seller provided Replacement Product or paid Energy Replacement Damages during the prior Performance Measurement Period, seventy percent (70%) of the Expected Energy for the first Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period or (b) the Delivered Energy plus Lost Output plus Deemed Delivered Energy in the first Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period, plus (ii) Delivered Energy plus Lost Output plus Deemed Delivered Energy in the second Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period.

“Lost Output” means the sum of electric energy in MWh that would have been generated and delivered, but was not, on account of any Forced Facility Outage (not caused by Seller’s fault or negligence), Force Majeure Events, System Emergencies, Buyer’s failure to perform, and Curtailment Order. The additional MWh comprising Lost Output shall be calculated in the same manner as Deemed Delivered Energy.

No payment shall be due if the calculation of (A - B) or (C - D) yields a negative number.

# EXHIBIT J  
## FORM OF LIMITED ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT  

This Limited Assignment Agreement (this “Assignment Agreement” or “Agreement”) is entered into as of [____], by and among [____], a [____] (“PPA Seller”), Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a municipal utility district organized under the provisions of the Municipal Utility District Act (Division 6, Chapter 2, Articles 2 and 3, Sections 11581 through 11614 of the California Public Utilities Code, as amended) (“PPA Buyer”), and J. Aron & Company LLC, a New York limited liability company (“J. Aron”), and relates to that certain power purchase agreement between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller as further described in Appendix 1 (the “PPA”). Unless the context otherwise specifies or requires, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the PPA.  

In consideration of the premises above and the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, PPA Seller, PPA Buyer and J. Aron (the “Parties” hereto; each is a “Party”) agree as follows:  

1. **Limited Assignment and Delegation.**  

   (a) PPA Buyer hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to J. Aron all right, title and interest in and to the rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA to receive delivery of the products described on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Products”) during the Assignment Period (as defined in Appendix 1), as such rights may be limited or further described in the “Further Information” section on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Product Rights”). All Assigned Products shall be delivered pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the Assignment Period as provided in Appendix 1. All other rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly reserved for PPA Buyer. The Parties agree that the assignment, transfer and/or conveyance of all or any portion of the Assigned Products in accordance with this Agreement and the Parties’ performance of any obligation in accordance with this Agreement shall not constitute a failure to meet the requirements of the PPA, or a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty under the PPA (and in no event shall PPA Seller be responsible for any failure of any portion of the Assigned Products to satisfy the requirements of the PPA, to the extent such failure results from the assignment, transfer and/or conveyance of such Assigned Products in accordance with this Agreement).  

   (b) PPA Buyer hereby delegates to J. Aron the obligation to pay the APC Contract Price set forth in Appendix 1 for all Assigned Products that are actually delivered to J. Aron pursuant to the Assigned Product Rights during the Assignment Period (the “Delivered Product Payment Obligation” and together with the Assigned Product Rights, collectively the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”); provided that (i) all other obligations of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly retained by PPA Buyer and PPA Buyer shall be solely responsible for any amounts due to PPA Seller that are not directly related to Assigned Products; and (ii) the Parties acknowledge and agree that PPA Seller will only be obligated to deliver a single consolidated invoice during the Assignment Period (with a copy to J. Aron consistent with Section 1(d) hereof). To the extent J. Aron fails to pay for any Assigned Products by the due date for payment set forth in the PPA, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, PPA Buyer agrees that it will remain jointly and severally responsible as a primary obligor (and not as a surety) for such payment and that it will be an Event of Default pursuant to Section 11.1(a) if PPA Buyer does not make such payment within five (5) Business Days (as

**entitled to pursue collection on such PPA Buyer Receivables directly against PPA Buyer pursuant to the remedies set forth in the PPA for such Event of Default.**

(f) On or before the commencement of the Assignment Period, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Guarantor”) will issue, in favor of PPA Seller, a guaranty of J. Aron’s payment obligations under this Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Appendix 3 attached hereto (“Guaranty”).

(g) The Assigned Prepay Quantity set forth in Appendix 2 relates to obligations by and between J. Aron and PPA Buyer and has no impact on PPA Seller’s rights and obligations under the PPA.

(h) In the event that the PPA or the Assigned Rights and obligations are either or both rejected or terminated in or as a result of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding affecting J. Aron, PPA Buyer shall, at the option of PPA Seller exercised within thirty (30) days after such rejection or termination, enter into a new agreement with PPA Seller having identical terms as the PPA (subject to any conforming changes necessitated by the substitution of parties and other changes as the parties may mutually agree), provided, that the term under such new agreement shall be no longer than the remaining balance of the term specified in the PPA.

**2. Assignment Early Termination.**

(a) The Assignment Period may be terminated early upon the occurrence of any of the following:

(1) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by either J. Aron or PPA Buyer to each of the other Parties;

(2) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by PPA Seller to each of J. Aron and PPA Buyer following J.

(2) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the transfer of any Affiliate Credit Enhancement, any interest or obligation in or under such Affiliate Credit Enhancement, or any property securing such Affiliate Credit Enhancement, to a transferee upon or following an Affiliate of J.

, 2024

NAME  
ADDRESS  

Attention:

Ladies and Gentlemen:

For value received, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Guarantor”), a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, hereby unconditionally guarantees the prompt and complete payment when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations and liabilities, whether now in existence or hereafter arising, of J. Aron & Company LLC, a subsidiary of the Guarantor and a limited liability company duly organized under the laws of the State of New York (the “Company”), to COUNTERPARTY NAME (the “Counterparty”) arising out of or under the Limited Assignment Agreement among the Company, the Counterparty and [PPA Seller] dated as of [ ], 202[ ]. This Guaranty is one of payment and not of collection.

The Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and notice of any obligation or liability to which it may apply, and waives presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any such obligation or liability, suit or the taking of other action by Counterparty against, and any other notice to, the Company, the Guarantor or others.

Counterparty may at any time and from time to time without notice to or consent of the Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder: (1) agree with the Company to make any change in the terms of any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (2) take or fail to take any action of any kind in respect of any security for any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (3) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company or others, or (4) compromise or subordinate any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty including any security therefor. Any other suretyship defenses are hereby waived by the Guarantor.

This Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect until the opening of business on the fifth business day after Counterparty receives written notice of termination from the Guarantor. It is understood and agreed, however, that notwithstanding any such termination this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the obligations and liabilities set forth above which shall have been incurred prior to such termination.

subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

The Guarantor may not assign its rights nor delegate its obligations under this Guaranty, in whole or in part, without prior written consent of the Counterparty, and any purported assignment or delegation absent such consent is void, except for (i) an assignment and delegation of all of the Guarantor’s rights and obligations hereunder in whatever form the Guarantor determines may be appropriate to a partnership, corporation, trust or other organization in whatever form that succeeds to all or substantially all of the Guarantor’s assets and business and that assumes such obligations by contract, operation of law or otherwise, and (ii) the Guarantor may transfer this Guaranty or any interest or obligation of the Guarantor in or under this Guaranty, or any property securing this Guaranty, to another entity as transferee as part of the resolution, restructuring or reorganization of the Guarantor upon or following the Guarantor becoming subject to a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding. Upon any such delegation and assumption or transfer of obligations, the Guarantor shall be relieved of and fully discharged from all obligations hereunder, whether such obligations arose before or after such delegation and assumption or transfer.

THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. GUARANTOR AGREES TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, OVER ANY DISPUTES ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY.

In the event the Guarantor becomes subject to a proceeding under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together, the "U.S. Special Resolution Regimes"), the transfer of this Guaranty, and any interest and obligation in or under, and any property securing, this Guaranty, from the Guarantor will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Guaranty, and any interest and obligation in or under this Guaranty, were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event the Company or the Guarantor, or any of their affiliates, becomes subject to a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, default rights against the Company or the Guarantor with respect to this Guaranty are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such default rights could be exercised under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Guaranty was governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.

Very truly yours,

**PRINCIPLES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT**

SMUD is committed to developing carbon free renewable energy in a manner that supports the community, protects the environment, and respects human rights. This document provides guidance on the key objectives that SMUD expects to achieve associated with this commitment. Renewable energy projects engaged in a commercial relationship with SMUD such as a power purchase agreement will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, implement, and maintain throughout the associated term, a “Community Benefits Plan” that addresses how the project will achieve the key objectives identified herein.

**Key objectives:**

1. **Land Use:** Prioritize previously developed lands. Avoid or minimize impacts on sensitive environmental resources, including but not limited to cultural resources, tribal cultural resources, and biological resources such as endangered species habitat, vernal pools and other sensitive habitats, “Waters of the US”, “Waters of the State” and waters identified by California Department of Fish and Wildlife as “Streambed”. Provide additional mitigation measures if avoidance and minimization measures cannot fully eliminate impacts. Applicants are expected to discuss these topics with both SMUD and the lead agency as early as possible to identify potential associated issues in advance of the purchase power agreement being finalized.

2. **Land Use:** All projects should employ techniques for maintaining and/or restoring ecosystem function to the site in conjunction with renewable energy outcomes, including establishment of native vegetation, restricting use of herbicides and pesticides, use of grazing for vegetation management and seasonally appropriate maintenance practices. Where development is on or surrounded by agricultural lands the project should also employ agricultural practices on the property during operations including sheep grazing, dry crop farming and irrigated food production where feasible.

3. **Land Use:** Employ design and construction practices that minimize ground disturbance to the maximum extent possible. This is especially critical in areas where cultural, tribal and biological resources are of significant concern.

4. **Sustainable Life Cycle Management:** Include plans for sustainable life cycle management of construction materials and project components during construction and operation that provides for recycling and reuse of construction waste and waste during operation including but not limited to the solar panels.

5. **Community Benefits:**

   (a) **Inclusive Economic Development:** Leverage SMUD’s Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) team to connect with certified small business vendors/contractors in SMUD’s service territory to support the project. Submit requests to seed.mgr@smud.org.

<!-- Page 98 -->
6. **Zero Carbon Workforce Development:** SMUD seeks to galvanize and prepare the region for an inclusive, diverse, creative, and empowered future workforce. Leverage SMUD’s existing workforce development agreements, programs, and partnerships throughout the Project to support the development of a clean energy labor force. The Project Team will work with SMUD to engage various elements of the labor supply chain via pre-apprentice and apprenticeship programs, internships, informational sessions, and mentorship opportunities.

7. **Sustainable Materials & Equipment:** Sourcing materials and equipment from companies that have a human rights policy and statement of supply chain ethics commitment that expresses the corporation’s commitment to meet the responsibility to respect human rights and uphold ethical business practices in their operations and value chains.

If Buyer does not agree to purchase Test Energy as set forth in this Section 3.7, Seller may sell such Test Energy, and any related products or attributes, to third parties and keep any and all revenues (and bear any and all costs) associated with such sales. The conditions precedent in Section 2.3 are not applicable to the Parties’ obligations under this Section 3.7.

3.8 Capacity Attributes.

(a) From and after the Capacity Attributes Guarantee Date, Seller sells, grants, pledges, assigns and otherwise commits to Buyer all of the Capacity Attributes.

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.8 and Section 3.12, throughout the Delivery Term, Seller shall perform all commercially reasonable actions necessary to ensure that the Facility is eligible to provide Capacity Attributes at the Delivery Point. From and after the Capacity Attributes Guarantee Date, subject to the provisions of this Section 3.8 and Section 3.12, Seller hereby covenants and agrees to transfer all Capacity Attributes to Buyer. Seller shall not commit or encumber any portion of Buyer's Share of the output of the Facility so as to prevent the entire Buyer’s Share from serving as Buyer's Supporting Resource (as defined in the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure Business Rules) and delivering the Guaranteed Capacity Attributes.

(c) Subject to Section 3.12, for the duration of the Delivery Term, Seller shall use good faith efforts, including as set forth in this Section 3.8(c), to comply with requirements in connection with Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity that (i) are instituted by the governing body of Buyer or the CAISO, and (ii) differ from CAISO or CPUC rules applicable to Resource Adequacy Benefits. Seller shall provide to Buyer an attestation, in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, stating that Buyer has procured the Capacity Attributes.

(d) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.8, at Buyer’s reasonable request, Seller shall execute such documents and instruments and take all steps and actions as may be reasonably required to effect recognition and transfer of the Capacity Attributes as belonging to Buyer; provided that no such request may impose any material additional third-party costs (other than those reimbursed by Buyer pursuant to Section 3.12) or obligations on Seller, or reduce Seller’s compensation hereunder.

(e) Buyer acknowledges that it may be required to take action and obtain certain rights at the Delivery Point in order to make use of the Capacity Attributes, including

-28-
84ET-387782
<!-- Page 135 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
obtaining and maintaining Import Capability and/or other rights as may be required under applicable Law to import energy and capacity into the CAISO Balancing Authority Area and make use of the Capacity Attributes. If applicable, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to support Buyer’s efforts to (i) obtain such Import Capability, (ii) obtain any other rights that Buyer is required to obtain, or (iii) take any other actions that Buyer is required to take, in each case in order for Buyer to make use of the Capacity Attributes, and in each case as may be required under applicable law and as may change from time to time. Buyer’s failure to obtain or maintain Import Capability or any other rights or capacities, or take any other actions, necessary to support the importation of the Capacity Attributes or otherwise receive or utilize the Capacity Attributes, for reasons other than a Seller failure under this Agreement, shall not be a Seller breach hereunder; any Capacity Attributes, expressed in kW, not delivered to Buyer due to such failure of Buyer shall be defined as “Deemed Delivered Capacity Attributes”. In addition, if any action or inaction of the governing board of Buyer (x) prevents Seller from delivering any Capacity Attributes to Buyer using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with limited to Seller’s obligations hereunder with respect to Capacity Attributes as of the Effective Date, or (y) disqualifies the Facility from providing Capacity Attributes to Buyer, in whole or in part, all such undelivered or ineligible Capacity Attributes shall constitute Deemed Delivered Capacity Attributes.

(f) From and after the Capacity Attributes Guarantee Date, for any calendar month in which there is a Capacity Attribute Shortfall greater than zero (0) kW:

(i) Seller shall be liable for liquidated damages (“Capacity Damage Amount”) in the amount of

3.9 CEC Certification and Verification. Seller shall (i) file an application with the CEC for CEC Certification and Verification of the Facility as soon as possible after the Commercial Operation Date, and (ii) provide to the CEC all information necessary to verify the contents of such application and maintain CEC Certification and Verification for the Facility throughout the Delivery Term; provided, Seller shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this sentence if Seller applies for CEC Certification and Verification within sixty (60) days after the Commercial Operation Date, and thereafter timely responds to any questions from the CEC.

Subject to the terms of this Section 3.9 and Section 3.12, Seller shall ensure that throughout the Delivery Term, the Product meet the criteria defined by the CEC Renewables Portfolio Standard Eligibility Guidebook for PCC-1.

under the Agreement with respect to obtaining, maintaining, conveying or effectuating Buyer’s use of (as applicable), the items listed below, then the Parties agree that the maximum amount of costs and expenses Seller shall be required to bear during any Contract Year shall be capped at  
**(“Compliance Expenditure Cap”)**  
(a) CEC Certification and Verification;  
(b) Green Attributes;  
(c) WREGIS; and  
(d) Capacity Attributes.  

Any actions required for Seller to comply with its obligations set forth in the first paragraph above, the cost of which will be included in the Compliance Expenditure Cap, shall be referred to collectively as the **“Compliance Actions.”**  

If Seller reasonably anticipates the need to incur out-of-pocket expenses in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap in order to take any Compliance Action, Seller shall provide Notice to Buyer of such anticipated out-of-pocket expenses.  

Buyer will have ninety (90) days to evaluate such Notice (during which time period Seller is not obligated to take any Compliance Actions described in the Notice) and shall, within such time, either (1) agree to reimburse Seller for all or some portion of the costs that exceed the Compliance Expenditure Cap (such Buyer-agreed upon costs, the **“Accepted Compliance Costs”**), or (2) waive Seller’s obligation to take such Compliance Actions, or any part thereof, for which Buyer has not agreed to reimburse Seller. If Buyer does not respond to a Notice given by Seller under this Section 3.12 within ninety (90) days after Buyer’s receipt of same, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its rights to require Seller to take the Compliance Actions that are the subject of the Notice, and Seller shall have no further obligations to take, and no liability for a failure to take, such Compliance Actions for the remainder of the Term; provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right to reconsider Compliance Actions that have been rejected or waived pursuant to this paragraph at any time; provided further, upon Buyer’s written request in connection with such reconsideration, Seller shall provide Notice to Buyer with an updated estimate of the anticipated out-of-pocket expenses to take the reconsidered Compliance Action. Within ninety (90) days after Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s Notice, Buyer shall agree to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs or waive Seller’s obligation to take the reconsidered Compliance Actions, or any part thereof, for which Buyer does not agree to reimburse Seller; provided, if Buyer does not reply within such ninety (90) day period Buyer shall be deemed to have waived Seller’s obligation to take such Compliance Actions.  

If Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs, then Seller shall take such Compliance Actions covered by the Accepted Compliance Costs as agreed upon by Buyer and Buyer shall reimburse Seller for Seller’s actual costs to effectuate the Compliance Actions, not to exceed the Accepted Compliance Costs, within sixty (60) days from the time that Buyer receives an invoice and documentation of such costs from Seller. If Buyer agrees to

provided, that if some amount of the Day-Ahead Forecast has been awarded a Day-Ahead Schedule, Seller shall not reduce the Delivered Energy, pursuant to this clause, below the amount of the Day-Ahead Forecast that has been awarded a Day-Ahead Schedule, and any such reduction shall not be included in a Market Curtailment Period. Seller shall also be permitted in its sole discretion to reduce a portion of Facility generation and/or deliveries of Facility generation to the Delivery Point not including Buyer’s Share during any Settlement Period that is not a Curtailment Period nor Market Curtailment Period. During such curtailments, Seller shall deliver Delivered Energy to Buyer in accordance with clause (c) of the definition of “Delivered Energy”. Illustrative settlement examples during the foregoing events are provided in Exhibit O.

4.7 Guaranteed Energy Production.

(a) After the first Contract Year, Seller shall be required to deliver to Buyer no less than the Guaranteed Energy Production (as defined below) in each period of two (2) consecutive Contract Years during the Delivery Term (such that the first Performance Measurement Period comprises Contract Years 2 and 3, the second Performance Measurement Period comprises Contract years 3 and 4 and so on) (“Performance Measurement Period”). “Guaranteed Energy Production” means an amount of Product for each Performance Measurement Period, as measured in MWh, equal to in such Performance Measurement Period. The calculation will be performed once each Contract Year, beginning with the third anniversary of the Commercial Operation Date. Seller shall be excused from achieving the Guaranteed Energy Production during any Performance Measurement Period only to the extent of any Forced Facility Outage (provided Seller has followed Prudent Operating Practices), Force Majeure Events, System Emergencies, Buyer’s failure to perform, Curtailment Periods and Market Curtailment Periods. If Seller fails to achieve the Guaranteed Energy Production amount in any Performance Measurement Period, Seller shall (i) pay Buyer Energy Replacement Damages calculated in accordance with Exhibit E, or (ii) in lieu of paying some or all of the Energy Replacement Damages, at Seller’s discretion, provide Replacement Product retrospectively pursuant to and subject to the requirements of Section 4.7(b)(ii).

(b) Seller shall be permitted to deliver Replacement Product (i) prospectively during any Performance Measurement Period if Seller reasonably anticipates that delivery of such Replacement Product is necessary to achieve the Guaranteed Energy Production for such Performance Measurement Period, or (ii) retrospectively during the Contract Year immediately following any Performance Measurement Period in accordance with Section 4.7(a) above; provided, Seller’s right to deliver Replacement Product shall be expressly subject to Buyer’s prior written acceptance of Seller’s proposed delivery schedule for such Replacement Product; provided further, Replacement Product shall be delivered to (x) at Seller’s election, the Delivery Point or the California-Oregon Border (COB) trading hub or (y) an Alternative Delivery Point. Seller shall provide Notice to Buyer of any proposed delivery of Replacement Product, including a proposed schedule of such deliveries, at least thirty (30) days prior to the proposed delivery of such Replacement Product and, solely with respect to retrospective Replacement Product, at least thirty (30) days after the conclusion of any Performance Measurement Period with respect to which Seller proposes to deliver retrospective Replacement Product.

4.8  WREGIS. Seller shall, at its sole expense, take all actions and execute all documents or instruments necessary to ensure that all WREGIS Certificates associated with all Renewable Energy Credits corresponding to all Delivered Energy are issued and tracked for purposes of satisfying the requirements of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard and transferred in a timely manner to Buyer for Buyer’s sole benefit. Seller shall transfer such Renewable Energy Credits to Buyer. Seller shall comply with all Laws, including the WREGIS Operating Rules, regarding the certification and transfer of such WREGIS Certificates to Buyer and Buyer shall be given sole title to all such WREGIS Certificates. Seller shall satisfy its obligations pursuant to Section 3.10(d) and Section 4.2(b) by fulfilling its obligations under Sections 4.8(a) through (f) below. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4.8, following the occurrence of the SPTO Date, Seller shall not be required to generate E-Tags associated with Delivered Energy and/or Replacement Energy unless required (i) pursuant to the CAISO Tariff, or (ii) by WREGIS, the CPUC, the CEC, or other applicable Law for matching E-Tags with Delivered Energy and/or Replacement Energy in order to validate RPS claims.

(a)  Prior to the Commercial Operation Date, Seller shall register the Facility with WREGIS and establish an account with WREGIS (“Seller’s WREGIS Account”), which Seller shall maintain until the end of the Delivery Term. Seller shall transfer the WREGIS Certificates using Recurring Certificate Transfers from Seller’s WREGIS Account to the WREGIS account(s) of Buyer or the account(s) of a designate that Buyer identifies by Notice to Seller (“Buyer’s WREGIS Account”). Seller shall be responsible for all expenses associated with registering the Facility with WREGIS, establishing and maintaining Seller’s WREGIS Account, paying WREGIS registration and annual fees, and transferring WREGIS Certificates from Seller’s WREGIS Account to Buyer’s WREGIS Account. Buyer shall be responsible for all expenses associated with establishing and maintaining Buyer’s WREGIS account.

(b)  Seller shall cause Recurring Certificate Transfers to occur on a monthly basis in accordance with the certification procedure established by the WREGIS Operating Rules. Since WREGIS Certificates will only be created for whole MWh amounts of Energy generated, any fractional MWh amounts (i.e., kWh) will be carried forward until sufficient generation is accumulated for the creation of a WREGIS Certificate. WREGIS Certificates must be matched with E-Tags associated with the Dynamic Transfers (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred and the CEC does not require E-Tag matching in order to validate RPS claims, with the Delivered Energy and Replacement Energy). WREGIS Certificates without matching E-Tags associated with Dynamic Transfers (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred and the CEC does not require E-Tag matching in order to validate RPS claims, with the Delivered Energy and Replacement Energy) will be rejected.

(c)  Seller shall, at its sole expense, ensure that the WREGIS Certificates for a given calendar month correspond with the Delivered Energy for such calendar month as evidenced by the amounts corresponding to the Facility’s metered data that match E-Tags associated with the Dynamic Transfers (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred and the CEC does not require E-Tag matching in order to validate RPS claims, with the Delivered Energy and Replacement Energy). Subject to delivery of Replacement Product, Seller shall ensure that no WREGIS Certificates are transferred to Buyer’s WREGIS Account unless they are the result of Delivered Energy reflected in the Facility’s metered data and matched with E-Tags associated

- **Section 4.8**: WREGIS Certificates
  - (d) Due to the approximately fourteen (14) day delay in the creation of WREGIS Certificates relative to the timing of invoice payment under Section 8.2, Buyer shall make an invoice payment for a given month in accordance with Section 8.2 notwithstanding that the WREGIS Certificates may not have been formally transferred to Buyer in accordance with the WREGIS Operating Rules and this Section 4.8. Notwithstanding this delay, Buyer shall have all right and title to all such WREGIS Certificates upon payment to Seller in accordance with Section 8.2.
  
  - (e) A “WREGIS Certificate Deficit” means any deficit or shortfall in WREGIS Certificates delivered to Buyer for a calendar month as compared to the Delivered Energy for the same calendar month (“Deficient Month”). If any WREGIS Certificate Deficit is caused, or the result of any action or inaction, by Seller, then the amount of Delivered Energy in the Deficient Month shall be reduced on a pro rata basis across all Settlement Periods in such Deficient Month by the amount of the WREGIS Certificate Deficit for purposes of calculating Buyer’s payment to Seller under Article 8 and the Guaranteed Energy Production for the applicable Performance Measurement Period; provided, however, that such adjustment shall not apply to the extent that after the ninety (90) days attributed to the delay in the creation of WREGIS Certificates for such Deficient Month, Seller either (x) resolves the WREGIS Certificate Deficit within an additional one hundred eighty (180) days (i) upon a schedule reasonably acceptable to Buyer and (ii) provided that such deliveries do not impose additional costs upon Buyer for which Seller refuses to provide reimbursement. If the amount of Delivered Energy in the Deficient Month is reduced in accordance with the prior sentence and neither (x) nor (y) of the prior sentence apply, Buyer shall pay Seller for any Delivered Energy that is delivered by Seller without corresponding WREGIS Certificates at a price equal to the lesser of (i) the Contract Price, or (ii) the LMP in the Day-Ahead Market at the Delivery Point, and for purposes of the Guaranteed Energy Production, Delivered Energy is reduced by the amount of the WREGIS Certificate Deficit for the applicable Performance Measurement Period. Without limiting Seller’s obligations under this Section 4.8, if a WREGIS Certificate Deficit is caused solely by an error or omission of WREGIS, Delivered Energy shall not be reduced pursuant to this Section 4.8(e) and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to cause WREGIS to correct its error or omission.
  
  - (f) If WREGIS changes the WREGIS Operating Rules after the Effective Date or applies the WREGIS Operating Rules in a manner inconsistent with this Section 4.8 after the Effective Date, the Parties promptly shall modify this Section 4.8 as reasonably required to cause and enable Seller to transfer to Buyer’s WREGIS Account a quantity of WREGIS Certificates for each given calendar month that corresponds to the Delivered Energy in the same calendar month.

- **Section 4.9**: Modification of Installed Capacity
  - At any time prior to January 31, 2025 (“Capacity Increase Deadline”), Seller shall have the option to elect to implement the South Turbine Uprate, and in connection therewith to (i) increase the maximum Installed Capacity of -41- 84ET-387782
<!-- Page 148 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
the Facility listed on the Cover Sheet of this Agreement up to an amount equal to 3,800 MW, and (ii) increase the Expected Energy under this Agreement to reflect the increased generating capacity resulting from the South Turbine Uprate. Seller shall deliver Notice to Buyer of its election to implement the South Turbine Uprate no later than the Capacity Increase Deadline, which Notice shall include the increased maximum Installed Capacity of the Facility and increased Expected Energy under this Agreement. Upon receipt of such Notice by Buyer, this Agreement shall be deemed automatically amended as follows:

(a) The text “3,515 MW” in the section “Description of Facility” on the Cover Sheet of this Agreement shall be replaced with the maximum Installed Capacity amount set forth in Seller’s Notice to Buyer delivered pursuant to this Section 4.9; and

(b) The text “________ MWh” in the section “Expected Energy” on the Cover Sheet of this Agreement shall be replaced with the Expected Energy amount set forth in Seller’s Notice to Buyer delivered pursuant to this Section 4.9.

4.10 Standard of Care. Seller shall be responsible for designing, installing, operating, and maintaining the Facility (including all associated costs) in accordance with applicable Law, and shall comply with all applicable WECC, RC West, FERC and NERC requirements, and with Prudent Operating Practice, including applicable interconnection and telemetering requirements set forth in the Interconnection Agreement.

Seller shall ensure that: (a) operation and maintenance of the Facility is conducted in a safe manner and in accordance with the Interconnection Agreement and Prudent Operating Practice; and (b) any governmental authorizations and permits required for the construction and operation thereof are maintained. Consistent with (a) above, Seller shall ensure that any necessary and commercially reasonable repairs are made to the Facility.

Seller acknowledges receipt of SMUD’s Principles of Renewable Energy Development as expressed in Exhibit M, attached and incorporated herein. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to abide by the project-specific obligations identified in the “Community Benefits Plan” as described in Exhibit M, to the extent applicable to and feasible for the Facility as reasonably determined by Seller.

ARTICLE 5  
TAXES

5.1 Allocation of Taxes and Charges. Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the Facility or on or with respect to the sale and delivery of Product to Buyer, that are imposed on Product prior to the Delivery Point. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the delivery to and purchase by Buyer of the Product that are imposed on Product at and from the Delivery Point (other than withholding or other Taxes imposed on Seller’s income, revenue, receipts or employees). If a Party is required to remit or pay Taxes that are the other Party’s responsibility hereunder, such Party shall promptly pay the Taxes due and then seek and receive reimbursement from the other for such Taxes. In the event any sale of Product hereunder is exempt from or not subject to any particular Tax, the exempted Party shall provide the other Party with all necessary documentation within thirty (30) days after

the Effective Date to evidence such exemption or exclusion. If the exempted Party does not provide such documentation, then such Party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party from any liability with respect to Taxes from which the exempted Party claims it is exempt.

5.2 Cooperation. Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to implement the provisions of and administer this Agreement in accordance with the intent of the Parties to minimize all Taxes, so long as no Party is materially adversely affected by such efforts. The Parties shall cooperate to minimize Tax exposure; provided, however, that neither Party shall be obligated to incur any financial or operational burden to reduce Taxes for which the other Party is responsible hereunder without receiving due compensation therefor from the other Party. All Energy delivered by Seller to Buyer hereunder shall be a sale made at wholesale, with Buyer reselling such Energy.

ARTICLE 6
MAINTENANCE OF THE FACILITY

6.1 Maintenance of the Facility. Seller shall comply with Law and Prudent Operating Practice relating to the operation and maintenance of the Facility and the generation and sale of Product.

6.2 Maintenance of Health and Safety. Seller shall take reasonable safety precautions with respect to the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the Facility. If Seller becomes aware of any circumstances relating to the Facility that create an imminent risk of damage or injury to any Person or any Person’s property, Seller shall take prompt, reasonable action to prevent such damage or injury and shall give Buyer’s emergency contact identified on Exhibit K notice of such condition. Such action may include disconnecting and removing all or a portion of the Facility, or suspending the supply of Energy to Buyer.

6.3 Shared Facilities. The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain of the Interconnection Facilities, Seller’s rights and obligations under the Interconnection Agreement and Seller’s rights and obligations under transmission service agreements with a Transmission Provider, may be subject to certain shared facilities and/or co-tenancy agreements (“Shared Facilities Agreements”) to be entered into among two or more of Seller, the Participating Transmission Owner, Seller’s Affiliates, and/or third parties pursuant to which certain interconnection facilities, interconnection service and/or transmission service may be subject to joint ownership and/or shared maintenance and operation arrangements.

ARTICLE 7
METERING

7.1 Metering. Seller shall measure the amount of Delivered Energy produced by the Facility using an Approved Meter. The Approved Meter shall be installed at the switching station adjacent to the SunZia East Converter Station and maintained at Seller’s cost. If the Approved Meter is inaccurate, Seller will cause such meter to be promptly corrected in accordance with Prudent Operating Practice and CAISO or PTO requirements, as applicable (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred, in accordance with CAISO requirements only). Seller will be

**ARTICLE 7**

**METERING**

7.1 Meter Maintenance. Seller shall be responsible for any costs, fines or penalties, including imbalance charges as a result of the inaccurate meter. The meter shall be kept under seal, such seals to be broken only when the meters are to be tested, adjusted, modified and/or relocated. In the event that Seller breaks a seal, Seller shall notify Buyer as soon as practicable. In addition, Seller hereby agrees to provide all Approved Meter data to Buyer in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and consents to Buyer obtaining from CAISO or the PTO, as applicable (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred, in accordance with CAISO requirements only), the meter data applicable to the Facility and all inspection, testing and calibration data and reports. Seller, or Seller’s Scheduling Coordinator, shall cooperate with Buyer to allow both Parties to retrieve the meter reads from the CAISO Market Results Interface – Settlements (MRIS-S) (or its successor).

7.2 Meter Verification. Annually, if Seller has reason to believe there may be a meter malfunction, or upon Buyer’s reasonable request, Seller shall test the meter. The tests shall be conducted by independent third parties qualified to conduct such tests at Seller’s expense; provided, if the meter is tested at Buyer’s request and is determined to be accurate, the costs of such test shall be borne by Buyer. Buyer shall be notified seven (7) days in advance of such tests and have a right to be present during such tests. If a meter is inaccurate it shall be promptly repaired or replaced. If a meter is inaccurate by more than one percent (1%) and it is not known when the meter inaccuracy commenced (if such evidence exists such date will be used to adjust prior invoices), then the invoices covering the period of time since the last meter test shall be adjusted for the amount of the inaccuracy on the assumption that the inaccuracy persisted during the second half of such period.

**ARTICLE 8**

**INVOICING AND PAYMENT; CREDIT**

8.1 Invoicing. Seller shall deliver an invoice to Buyer no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the prior monthly delivery period; provided that Seller’s failure to deliver an invoice to Buyer by such deadline shall not be a breach hereunder. Each invoice shall provide Buyer (a) records of metered data, including metering and CAISO transaction data sufficient to document and verify the amount of Delivered Energy for each Settlement Period during the preceding month, including the amount of Delivered Energy as set forth in the first CAISO settlement statement for the prior month that includes meter data from the Approved Meter, the applicable Contract Price, deviations between the Scheduled Energy and the Delivered Energy, the LMP in the Real-Time Market at the Delivery Point for each Settlement Period; (b) a reconciliation of hourly meter data, E-Tag data (to the extent required under the CAISO Tariff) and associated calculations, including the lesser of each hour, plus any additional data as may be reasonably required by Buyer for compliance with CPUC reporting obligations, including pursuant to the CPUC’s Energy Division Portfolio Content Category Classification Review Handbook (or successor publication); (c) a statement of the quantity of WREGIS Certificates transferred during the prior month that have been matched with E-Tags associated with the Dynamic Transfers (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred, with the Delivered Energy and Replacement Energy, to the extent required by WREGIS, the CPUC, the CEC, or other applicable Law); (d) access to any records, including invoices or settlement data from the CAISO, necessary to verify the accuracy of any amount; and (e) be in a reasonable format covering the services provided in the preceding month determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

-44-

<!-- Page 151 -->
8.2  Payment. Buyer shall make payment to Seller by wire transfer or ACH payment to the bank account provided on each monthly invoice. Buyer shall pay undisputed invoice amounts within thirty (30) days after receipt of the invoice. If such due date falls on a weekend, local business holiday observed by either Party, or a NERC holiday, such due date shall be the next Business Day. Payments made after the due date will be considered late and will bear interest on the unpaid balance. If the amount due is not paid on or before the due date or if any other payment that is due and owing from one party to another is not paid on or before its applicable due date, a late payment charge shall be applied to the unpaid balance and shall be added to the next billing statement. Such late payment charge shall be calculated based on an annual Interest Rate equal to the prime rate published on the date of the invoice in The Wall Street Journal (or, if The Wall Street Journal is not published on that day, the next succeeding date of publication), plus two percent (2%) (the “Interest Rate”). If the due date occurs on a day that is not a Business Day, the late payment charge shall begin to accrue on the next succeeding Business Day.

8.3  Books and Records. To facilitate payment and verification, each Party shall maintain all books and records necessary for billing and payments, including copies of all invoices under this Agreement, for a period of at least two (2) years or as otherwise required by Law. Upon fifteen (15) days’ Notice to Seller, Buyer shall be granted reasonable access to the accounting books and records pertaining to all invoices generated pursuant to this Agreement.

8.4  Payment Adjustments; Billing Errors. Payment adjustments shall be made if Seller discovers there have been good faith inaccuracies in invoicing that are material or otherwise disputed under Section 8.5, there is determined to have been a meter inaccuracy sufficient to require a payment adjustment, or if CAISO recalculates amounts due or owing in respect of prior periods. If the required adjustment is in favor of Buyer, Buyer’s monthly payment shall be credited in an amount equal to the adjustment. If the required adjustment is in favor of Seller, Seller shall add the adjustment amount to Buyer’s next monthly invoice. Other than recalculations by CAISO, adjustments in favor of either Buyer or Seller shall bear interest, until settled in full, in accordance with Section 8.2, accruing from the date on which the non-erring Party received Notice thereof.

8.5  Billing Disputes. A Party may, in good faith, dispute the correctness of any invoice or any adjustment to an invoice rendered under this Agreement or adjust any invoice for any arithmetic or computational error within twelve (12) months of the date the invoice, or adjustment to an invoice, was rendered. In the event an invoice or portion thereof, or any other claim or adjustment arising hereunder, is disputed, payment of the undisputed portion of the invoice shall be required to be made when due. Any invoice dispute or invoice adjustment shall be in writing and shall state the basis for the dispute or adjustment. Payment of the disputed amount shall not be required until the dispute is resolved. Upon resolution of the dispute, any required payment shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of such resolution along with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the original due date to but excluding the date paid. Inadvertent overpayments shall be returned upon request or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment from subsequent payments, with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the date of such overpayment but excluding the date repaid or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment. Any dispute with respect to an invoice is waived if the other Party is not notified in accordance with this Section 8.5 within twelve (12) months after the -45- 84ET-387782
<!-- Page 152 -->
![Invoice Section](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Invoice+Section)

invoice is rendered or subsequently adjusted, except to the extent any misinformation was from a third party not affiliated with any Party and such third party corrects its information after the twelve-month period. If an invoice is not rendered within twelve (12) months after the close of the month during which performance occurred, the right to payment for such performance is waived.

8.6 **Netting of Payments.** The Parties hereby agree that they shall discharge mutual debts and payment obligations due and owing to each other on the same date through netting, in which case all undisputed amounts owed by each Party to the other Party for the purchase and sale of Product during the monthly billing period under this Agreement or otherwise arising out of this Agreement, including any related damages calculated pursuant to Exhibits B and E, interest, and payments or credits, including pursuant to Section 4.3(c), shall be netted so that only the excess amount remaining due shall be paid by the Party who owes the remaining amount.

8.7 **Seller's Development Security.** To secure its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall deliver Development Security to Buyer within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date. Seller shall maintain the Development Security in full force and effect. Upon the earlier of (A) Seller’s delivery of the Performance Security, or (B) sixty (60) days after termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall return the Development Security to Seller, less the amounts drawn in accordance with this Agreement. If and to the extent that any portion of the Development Security is a Letter of Credit and the issuer of such Letter of Credit (i) fails to maintain a Credit Rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s, (ii) indicates intent not to renew such Letter of Credit and such Letter of Credit expires prior to the Commercial Operation Date, (iii) fails to honor Buyer’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit, or (iv) becomes Bankrupt, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to post substitute collateral that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Development Security. Seller shall have no obligation to replenish the Development Security following any draws thereon by Buyer. Seller’s maximum liability for an Event of Default or failure to perform its obligations hereunder prior to the Commercial Operation Date shall be capped at the amount of the Development Security, less any amounts collected by Buyer prior to such Event of Default or failure to perform.

8.8 **Seller's Performance Security.** To secure its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall deliver Performance Security to Buyer on or before the Commercial Operation Date. Seller shall maintain the Performance Security in full force and effect until the following occurred: (A) the Delivery Term has expired or terminated early; and (B) all payment obligations of the Seller arising under this Agreement, including compensation for penalties, Termination Payment, indemnification payments or other damages are paid in full (whether directly or indirectly such as through set-off or netting). Following the occurrence of both events, Buyer shall promptly return to Seller the unused portion of the Performance Security. If and to the extent that any portion of the Performance Security is a Letter of Credit and the issuer of such Letter of Credit (i) fails to maintain a Credit Rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s, (ii) fails to honor Buyer’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit, or (iii) becomes Bankrupt, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to post substitute collateral that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Performance Security.

![Financial Statements and Security Interest](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Financial+Statements+and+Security+Interest)

8.9 Financial Statements.

(a) If requested, Buyer shall provide to Seller (i) within one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of each fiscal year during the Contract Term, a copy of Buyer’s annual report containing audited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal year and (ii) within sixty (60) days after the end of each of its first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year during the Contract Term, a copy of Buyer’s quarterly report containing unaudited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal quarter. In all cases the statements shall be for the most recent accounting period and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”); provided, however, that should any such statements not be available on a timely basis due to a delay in preparation or certifications, such unavailability shall not be an Event of Default so long as Buyer diligently pursues the preparation, certification, and delivery of the statements.

8.10 Buyer’s First Priority Security Interest in Cash or Cash Equivalent Collateral. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, and until released as provided herein, Seller hereby grants to Buyer a present and continuing first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), and assignment of the Development Security or Performance Security, any other cash collateral and cash equivalent collateral posted by Seller pursuant to Sections 8.7 and 8.8, and any and all interest thereon or proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof, whether now or hereafter held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of Buyer, and Seller agrees to take all action as Buyer reasonably requires in order to perfect Buyer’s first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), such collateral and any and all proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof.

Upon or any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default caused by Seller, an Early Termination Date resulting from an Event of Default caused by Seller, or an occasion provided for in this Agreement where Buyer is authorized to retain all or a portion of the Development Security or Performance Security, Buyer may do any one or more of the following (in each case subject to the final sentence of this Section 8.10 and the provisions of Article 12):

(a) Exercise any of its rights and remedies with respect to the Development Security or Performance Security, as applicable, including any such rights and remedies under Law then in effect;

(b) Draw on any outstanding Letter of Credit issued for its benefit and retain any cash held by Buyer as Development Security or Performance Security, as applicable; and

(c) Liquidate all Development Security or Performance Security, as applicable then held by or for the benefit of Buyer from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of Seller, including any equity or right of purchase or redemption by Seller.

Buyer shall apply the proceeds of the collateral realized upon the exercise of any such rights or remedies to reduce Seller’s obligations under this Agreement (Seller remains liable for any amounts owing to Buyer after such application), subject to Buyer’s obligation to return any surplus proceeds remaining after these obligations are satisfied in full.

![ARTICLE 10 FORCE MAJEURE](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=ARTICLE+10+FORCE+MAJEURE)

**ARTICLE 10  
FORCE MAJEURE**

10.1 **Definition.**

(a) **“Force Majeure Event”** means any act or event that delays or prevents a Party from timely performing all or a portion of its obligations under this Agreement or from complying with all or a portion of the conditions under this Agreement if such act or event, which event or circumstance, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, cannot be avoided by and is beyond the reasonable control (whether direct or indirect) of and without the fault or negligence of the Party relying thereon as justification for such delay, nonperformance, or noncompliance.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, so long as the following events, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, cannot be avoided by, and are beyond the reasonable control (whether direct or indirect) of and without the fault or negligence of the Party relying thereon as justification for such delay, nonperformance or noncompliance, a Force Majeure Event may include an act of God or the elements, such as flooding, lightning, hurricanes, tornadoes, or ice storms; explosion; fire; volcanic eruption; flood; epidemic, or pandemic, including COVID-19 (but only to the extent that new governmental rules or mandates related to COVID-19 are implemented that were not in place as of the Effective Date); landslide; mudslide; sabotage; terrorism; earthquake; or other cataclysmic events; an act of public enemy; acts or failure to act by a Governmental Authority; war; blockade; civil insurrection; riot; civil

84ET-387782

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Force Majeure Event” does not include (i) economic conditions that render a Party’s performance of this Agreement at the Contract Price unprofitable or otherwise uneconomic (including Buyer’s ability to buy Energy at a lower price, or Seller’s ability to sell Energy generated by the Facility at a higher price, than the Contract Price); (ii) Seller’s inability to obtain permits or approvals of any type for the construction, operation, or maintenance of the Facility, except to the extent such inability is caused by a Force Majeure Event; (iii) the inability of a Party to make payments when due under this Agreement; (iv) a Curtailment Order, except to the extent that a Curtailment Order is caused by an event that otherwise qualifies as a Force Majeure Event; (v) Seller’s inability to obtain sufficient labor, equipment, materials, or other resources to build or operate the Facility except to the extent such inability is caused by a Force Majeure Event; (vi) a strike, work stoppage or labor dispute limited only to any one or more of Seller, Seller’s Affiliates, Seller’s contractors, their subcontractors thereof or any other third party employed by Seller to work on the Facility; (vii) any equipment failure except if such equipment failure is caused by a Force Majeure Event; or (viii) except as the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date may be extended as a result of a Development Cure Period, Seller’s inability to achieve Commercial Operation following the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date.

10.2 No Liability If a Force Majeure Event Occurs. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall be liable to the other Party in the event it is prevented from performing its obligations hereunder in whole or in part due to a Force Majeure Event. The Party rendered unable to fulfill any obligation by reason of a Force Majeure Event shall take reasonable actions necessary to remove such inability with due speed and diligence. Nothing herein shall be construed as permitting that Party to continue to fail to perform after said cause has been removed. The obligation to use due speed and diligence shall not be interpreted to require resolution of labor disputes by acceding to demands of the opposition when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the Party having such difficulty. Neither Party shall be considered in breach or default of this Agreement if and to the extent that any failure or delay in the Party’s performance of one or more of its obligations hereunder is caused by a Force Majeure Event. The occurrence and continuation of a Force Majeure Event shall not suspend or excuse the obligation of a Party to make any payments due hereunder. Any delays caused by a Force Majeure Event will not serve to increase the Contract Term nor Contract Price of this Agreement.

10.3 Notice. In the event of any delay or nonperformance resulting from a Force Majeure Event, the Party suffering the Force Majeure Event shall (a) as soon as practicable, notify the other Party in writing of the nature, cause, estimated date of commencement thereof, the anticipated extent of any delay or interruption in performance, and, to the extent reasonably practicable, a mitigation plan for limiting or overcoming the impacts of the Force Majeure Event and (b) notify the other Party in writing of the cessation or termination of such Force Majeure Event, all as known or estimated in good faith by the affected Party; provided, however, that a Party’s failure to give timely Notice as provided in this Section 10.3 shall not affect such Party’s ability to assert that a Force Majeure Event has occurred unless the delay in giving Notice materially prejudices the other Party.
<!-- Page 156 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
10.4 **Termination Following Force Majeure Event.** If a Force Majeure Event has occurred after the Commercial Operation Date that has caused either Party to be unable to perform its material obligations hereunder, and has continued for a consecutive twelve (12) month period, then the non-claiming Party may terminate this Agreement upon Notice to the other Party experiencing the Force Majeure Event; provided that if Seller is the Party claiming such Force Majeure Event and such Force Majeure Event cannot reasonably be cured within such twelve (12) month period, then Seller may provide a plan to Buyer, which must be acceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion, to cure such Force Majeure Event within an additional consecutive six (6) month period and Buyer may not terminate this Agreement due to such Force Majeure Event unless Seller has not resumed performance of its material obligations hereunder upon the expiration of such additional consecutive six (6) month period. Upon any such termination, the non-claiming Party shall have no liability to the Party claiming Force Majeure Event, save and except for those obligations specified in Section 2.1(b).

**DEFAULTS; REMEDIES; TERMINATION**

(iii) the failure by such Party to perform any material covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement (except to the extent constituting a separate Event of Default) and such failure is not remedied within thirty (30) days after Notice thereof; provided, that this thirty (30) day period shall be extended by an additional sixty (60) days if (a) the breach cannot reasonably be cured within the thirty (30) day period despite diligent efforts, (b) the default is capable of being cured within the additional sixty (60) day period, and (c) the Defaulting Party commences the cure within the original thirty (30) day period and is at all times thereafter diligently and continuously proceeding to cure the breach;

(b) with respect to Seller as the Defaulting Party, the occurrence of any of the following:

(i) except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time, Seller delivers or attempts to deliver Energy to the Delivery Point for sale under this Agreement that was not generated by the Facility; or

(ii) with respect to any outstanding Letter of Credit provided for the benefit of Buyer that is not then required under this Agreement to be canceled or returned, the failure by Seller to provide for the benefit of Buyer either (1) cash, (2) a replacement surety bond (solely with respect to the Performance Security), or (3) a substitute Letter of Credit from a different issuer meeting the criteria set forth in the definition of Letter of Credit, in each case, in the amount required hereunder within ten (10) Business Days after Seller receives Notice of the occurrence of any of the following events:

11.2 Remedies; Declaration of Early Termination Date. If an Event of Default with respect to a Defaulting Party shall have occurred and be continuing, the other Party (“Non-Defaulting Party”) shall have the following rights:

(a) to send Notice, designating a day, no earlier than the day such Notice is deemed to be received and no later than twenty (20) days after such Notice is deemed to be received, as an early termination date of this Agreement (“Early Termination Date”) that terminates this Agreement (the “Terminated Transaction”) and ends the Contract Term effective as of the Early Termination Date;

(b) to accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties, and to collect as liquidated damages (i) the Damage Payment (in the case of an Event of Default by Seller occurring before the Commercial Operation Date) or (ii) the Termination Payment calculated in accordance with Section 11.3 below (in the case of any other Event of Default by Seller after the Commercial Operation Date or by Buyer throughout the Contract Term);

(c) to withhold any payments due to the Defaulting Party under this Agreement;

(d) to suspend performance; and

(e) to exercise any other right or remedy available at Law or in equity, including specific performance or injunctive relief, except to the extent such remedies are expressly limited under this Agreement;

provided, that payment by the Defaulting Party of the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, shall constitute liquidated damages and the Non-Defaulting Party’s sole and exclusive remedy for the Terminated Transaction and the Event of Default related thereto. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller’s sole and aggregate liability under or arising out of a termination of this Agreement prior to the Commercial Operation Date shall be limited to the amount required to be posted as Development Security pursuant to Section 8.7, less any amounts collected by Buyer prior to such Early Termination Date.

11.3 Termination Payment. The termination payment (“Termination Payment”) for a Terminated Transaction shall be the aggregate of all Settlement Amounts plus any or all other amounts due to the Non-Defaulting Party netted into a single amount. If the Non-Defaulting Party’s aggregate Gains exceed its aggregate Losses and Costs, if any, resulting from the termination of this Agreement, the net Settlement Amount shall be zero. The Non-Defaulting Party shall calculate, in a commercially reasonable manner, a Settlement Amount for the Terminated Transaction as of the Early Termination Date. Third parties (which shall not include Affiliates of the Non-Defaulting Party) supplying information for purposes of the calculation of Gains or Losses may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors and other sources of market information. The Settlement Amount shall not include consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary, indirect or business interruption damages; provided, however, that any lost Capacity Attributes and Green Attributes shall be deemed direct damages covered by this Agreement. Without prejudice to the Non-Defaulting Party’s duty to mitigate, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not have to enter into

**ARTICLE 11**  
**TERMINATION PAYMENTS**

11.1 **Calculation of Termination Payment.** The Non-Faulting Party shall calculate the Termination Payment based on the actual damages incurred and may use replacement transactions to establish a Settlement Amount. Each Party agrees and acknowledges that (a) the actual damages that the Non-Defaulting Party would incur in connection with a Terminated Transaction would be difficult or impossible to predict with certainty, (b) the Damage Payment or Termination Payment described in Section 11.2 or this Section 11.3 (as applicable) is a reasonable and appropriate approximation of such damages, and (c) the Damage Payment or Termination Payment described in Section 11.2 or this Section 11.3 (as applicable) is the exclusive remedy of the Non-Defaulting Party in connection with a Terminated Transaction but shall not otherwise act to limit any of the Non-Defaulting Party’s rights or remedies if the Non-Defaulting Party does not elect a Terminated Transaction as its remedy for an Event of Default by the Defaulting Party.

11.4 **Notice of Payment of Termination Payment.** As soon as practicable after a Terminated Transaction, Notice shall be given by the Non-Defaulting Party to the Defaulting Party of the amount of the Termination Payment and whether the Termination Payment is due to the Non-Defaulting Party. The Notice shall include a written statement explaining in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount and the sources for such calculation. The Termination Payment shall be made to the Non-Defaulting Party, as applicable, within ten (10) Business Days after such Notice is effective.

11.5 **Disputes With Respect to Termination Payment.** If the Defaulting Party disputes the Non-Defaulting Party’s calculation of the Termination Payment, in whole or in part, the Defaulting Party shall, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Non-Defaulting Party’s calculation of the Termination Payment, provide the Non-Defaulting Party a detailed written explanation of the basis for such dispute. Disputes regarding the Termination Payment shall be determined in accordance with Article 15.

11.6 **Rights And Remedies Are Cumulative.** Except where liquidated damages are provided as the exclusive remedy, the rights and remedies of a Party pursuant to this Article 11 shall be cumulative and in addition to the rights of the Parties otherwise provided in this Agreement.

11.7 **Mitigation.** Any Non-Defaulting Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its Costs, Losses and damages resulting from any Event of Default of the other Party under this Agreement.

**ARTICLE 12**  
**LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES**

12.1 **No Consequential Damages.** EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PART OF AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER OR ITS INDEMNIFIED PERSONS FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOSSES OR DAMAGES FOR LOST REVENUE OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE.

12.2 Waiver and Exclusion of Other Damages. THE PARTIES CONFIRM THAT THE EXPRESS REMEDIES AND MEASURES OF DAMAGES PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT SATISFY THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSES HEREOF. ALL LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THOSE PERTAINING TO THE PARTIES’ LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND THE PARTIES’ WAIVER OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SHALL APPLY EVEN IF THE REMEDIES FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE DEEMED TO “FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE” OR ARE OTHERWISE HELD TO BE INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, IF THERE IS AN EARLY TERMINATION DATE PRIOR TO THE COMMERCIAL OPERATION DATE, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF SELLER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT REQUIRED TO BE POSTED AS DEVELOPMENT SECURITY PURSUANT TO SECTION 8.7, LESS ANY AMOUNTS COLLECTED BY BUYER PRIOR TO SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE.

FOR BREACH OF ANY PROVISION FOR WHICH AN EXPRESS AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS PROVIDED, SUCH EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, THE OBLIGOR’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED AS SET FORTH IN SUCH PROVISION, AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED.

IF NO REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, THE OBLIGOR’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES ONLY. THE VALUE OF ANY TAX BENEFITS, DETERMINED ON AN AFTER-TAX BASIS, LOST DUE TO BUYER’S DEFAULT (WHICH SELLER HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO MITIGATE AFTER USE OF REASONABLE EFFORTS) AND AMOUNTS DUE IN CONNECTION WITH THE RECAPTURE OF ANY RENEWABLE ENERGY INCENTIVES, IF ANY, SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE DIRECT DAMAGES.

TO THE EXTENT ANY DAMAGES REQUIRED TO BE PAID HEREUNDER ARE LIQUIDATED, INCLUDING UNDER SECTIONS 3.8, 4.7, 4.8(e), 11.2 AND 11.3, AND AS PROVIDED IN EXHIBIT B AND EXHIBIT E, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE, THAT OTHERWISE OBTAINING AN ADEQUATE REMEDY IS INCONVENIENT, AND THAT THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CONSTITUTE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE ANTICIPATED HARM OR LOSS. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO CONTEST SUCH PAYMENTS AS AN UNREASONABLE PENALTY.

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT MONEY DAMAGES AND THE EXPRESS REMEDIES PROVIDED FOR HEREIN ARE AN ADEQUATE REMEDY FOR THE BREACH BY THE OTHER OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND EACH

<!-- Page 163 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

the written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any direct or indirect Change of Control of a Party (whether voluntary or by operation of Law) will be deemed an assignment and will require the prior written consent of the other Party, except as provided in Section 14.3. Any assignment made without required written consent, or in violation of the conditions to assignment set out below, shall be null and void. The assigning Party shall be responsible for the other Party’s costs associated with the preparation, review, execution, and delivery of documents in connection with any assignment of this Agreement, including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees.

14.2 Collateral Assignment. Subject to the provisions of this Section 14.2, Seller has the right to assign this Agreement as collateral for any financing or refinancing of the Facility without the consent of Buyer. In connection with any financing or refinancing of the Facility by Seller, Buyer shall work in good faith with Seller (and its Affiliate(s)) and Lender to agree upon and execute a consent to collateral assignment of this Agreement substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit H.

14.3 Permitted Assignment. Notwithstanding Section 14.1, and in addition to its rights set forth in Section 14.2, Seller may at any time, without the prior written consent of Buyer, transfer or assign this Agreement (including by a Change of Control) (i) to an Affiliate of Seller, (ii) in connection with a tax equity financing (regardless of whether a Change of Control results from such tax equity financing), or (iii) as part of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the membership interests, equity, or assets of an Affiliate of Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller may, without the prior written consent of Buyer, transfer or assign this Agreement (including by Change of Control) to a Permitted Transferee.

14.4 Buyer Assignment.

ARTICLE 15 DISPUTE RESOLUTION

shall be brought in the federal courts of the United States or, if such federal courts refuse jurisdiction notwithstanding the Parties' agreement, then in the courts of the State of California, in either case sitting in the County of San Francisco, California.

15.2 Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dispute arising under this Agreement, within ten (10) days following the receipt of a Notice from either Party identifying such dispute, the Parties shall meet, negotiate and attempt, in good faith, to resolve the dispute quickly, informally and inexpensively.

ARTICLE 16
INDEMNIFICATION

16.1 Indemnification.

(a) Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, representatives and agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Party”) from and against all third-party claims, demands, losses, liabilities, penalties, and expenses and expert witness fees (collectively “Indemnifiable Event”), to the extent such Indemnifiable Event arises out of, results from, or is caused by any of the following: (a) the negligent act or omission, recklessness or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party, its Affiliates, its or their directors, officers, employees, agents, subcontractors, and anyone directly or indirectly employed by the Indemnifying Party or any of its subcontractors or anyone that they control; or (b) any violation of applicable Law by the Indemnifying Party, in each case in connection with this Agreement. Upon the Indemnified Party’s written request, the Indemnifying Party, at its own expense, must defend any suit or action that is subject to the Indemnifying Party’s indemnity obligations.

(b) Nothing in this Section 16.1 shall enlarge or relieve Seller or Buyer of any liability to the other for any breach of this Agreement. Neither Party shall be indemnified for its damages resulting to the extent of its own negligence, intentional acts, or willful misconduct. These indemnity provisions shall not be construed to relieve any insurer of its obligation to pay claims consistent with the provisions of a valid insurance policy.

16.2 Claims. Promptly after receipt by a Party of any claim or Notice of the commencement of any action, administrative, or legal proceeding, or investigation as to which the indemnity provided for in this Article 16 may apply, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such fact. The Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof with counsel designated by such Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to, or inconsistent with, those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select and be represented by separate counsel, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, unless a liability insurer is willing to pay such costs. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume

-58-
84ET-387782
<!-- Page 165 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the defense of a claim meriting indemnification, the Indemnified Party may at the expense of the Indemnifying Party contest, settle, or pay such claim, provided that settlement or full payment of any such claim may be made only following consent of the Indemnifying Party or, absent such consent, written opinion of the Indemnified Party’s counsel that such claim is meritorious or warrants settlement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence if the settlement consists solely of a monetary payment by the Indemnifying Party, such settlement shall not require the consent of the Indemnifying Party. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 16, in the event that a Party is obligated to indemnify and hold the other Party and its successors and assigns harmless under this Article 16, the amount owing to the Indemnified Party will be the amount of the Indemnified Party’s damages net of any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party following a reasonable effort by the Indemnified Party to obtain such insurance proceeds.

ARTICLE 17  
INSURANCE.

17.1 Insurance.

(a) General Liability. Seller shall maintain, or cause to be maintained at its sole expense, (i) commercial general liability insurance against claims for personal injury (including bodily injury and death) and property damage with a limit of liability of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence, and a general aggregate of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for combined bodily injury and property damage; and (ii) an umbrella insurance policy in a minimum limit of liability of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). The amounts of liability insurance described in this Article 17 may be satisfied by primary insurance or by any combination of primary and excess/umbrella insurance. Such insurance shall contain standard cross-liability and severability of interest provisions such that each person is protected in the same manner as though a separate policy has been issued to each but nothing therein shall operate to increase the insurance company’s liability beyond the amount the insurance company would have been liable if only one Person or interest had been named as insured. The liability insurance policies referenced in this Article 17 shall (x) provide an endorsement waiving rights of subrogation against Buyer, (y) name Buyer as additional insured on all required liability insurance (except workers compensation), and (z) be primary to any insurance of Buyer that may apply to such occurrence, accident or claim and no “other insurance” provision shall be applicable to Buyer or any additional insureds, by virtue of having been named an additional insured under any policy of insurance.

(b) Workers Compensation and Employer’s Liability Insurance. Employers’ Liability insurance shall not be less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) providing statutory benefits as required by Law (if any exposure exists) for injury, sickness, disability or death of the employees.

(c) Business Auto Liability Insurance. Seller shall maintain at all times during the Contract Term business auto insurance for bodily injury and property damage with limits of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit. Such insurance shall cover liability arising out of Seller’s use of all owned (if any), non-owned and hired motor vehicles in the performance of the Agreement.

-59-  
84ET-387782
<!-- Page 166 -->
(d) Property Insurance. Seller shall maintain or cause to be maintained property insurance covering the Facility against physical loss or damage, including coverage for natural perils including but not limited to flood, earthquake, windstorm, severe convective storm, and wildfire, all with limits in accordance with industry standard recognizing that natural perils may be subject to a lower sublimit. Coverage will be on an "all-risk" basis including mechanical and electrical breakdown.

(e) Documentation. Before commencing work under this Agreement, Seller’s broker or agent shall provide certificates of insurance verifying that at least the minimum insurance coverages required above are in effect with additional insured, waiver of subrogation and any other policy provisions or endorsements included, as applicable. Acceptance of the evidence of coverage by Buyer shall not relieve or decrease the extent to which Seller may be held responsible for payment of damages resulting from Seller’s services or operations pursuant to this Agreement, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Buyer’s rights to insurance coverage hereunder. Failure to demand evidence of full compliance with the insurance requirements set forth in this Agreement or failure to identify any insurance deficiency shall not relieve Seller from, nor be construed or deemed a waiver of, its obligation to maintain the required insurance at all times during the performance of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 18
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

18.1 Definition of Confidential Information. The following constitutes “Confidential Information,” whether oral or written which is delivered by Seller to Buyer or by Buyer to Seller including: (a) pricing and other commercially-sensitive or proprietary information provided to or from Buyer in connection with the terms and conditions of, proposals and negotiations related to, this Agreement, and (b) information that either Seller or Buyer stamps or otherwise identifies as “confidential” or “proprietary” before disclosing it to the other. Confidential Information does not include (i) information that was publicly available at the time of the disclosure, other than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Agreement; (ii) information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the recipient after the time of delivery; (iii) information that was rightfully in the possession of the recipient (without confidential or proprietary restriction) at the time of delivery or that becomes available to the recipient from a source not subject to any restriction against disclosing such information to the recipient; and (iv) information that the recipient independently developed without a violation of this Agreement.

18.2 Duty to Maintain Confidentiality. Except as permitted in this Article 18, neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information to a third party, except upon the written consent of the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information will retain its character as Confidential Information but may be disclosed by the recipient (the “Receiving Party”) if and to the extent such disclosure is required (a) to be made by any requirements of Law, (b) pursuant to an order of a court or (c) in order to enforce or implement this Agreement. If the Receiving Party becomes legally compelled (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas, summons, civil investigative demands, or similar processes or otherwise in connection with any litigation or to comply with any applicable Law, order, regulation, ruling, regulatory request, accounting disclosure rule or standard or any exchange, control area or

18.3 Irreparable Injury; Remedies. Receiving Party acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are necessary and reasonable in order to protect Disclosing Party and the business of Disclosing Party, and expressly acknowledges that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate Disclosing Party for any breach or threatened breach by Receiving Party of any covenants and agreements set forth herein. Accordingly, Receiving Party acknowledges that any such breach or threatened breach may cause irreparable injury to Disclosing Party and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in Law, in equity or otherwise, Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages.

18.4 Permitted Disclosures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 18, Confidential Information may be disclosed by either Party to such Party’s counsel, accountants, auditors, advisors, other professional consultants, credit rating agencies, Affiliates or actual or prospective owners, investors, lenders, directors, underwriters, contractors, suppliers or others involved in the construction, operation and financing transactions and arrangements for a Party or its affiliates, or any of its or their agents, consultants or trustees, so long as the person to whom Confidential Information is disclosed agrees in writing to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Article 18 to the same extent as if it were a Party, or is bound by substantially similar confidentiality requirements.

18.5 Press Releases. Neither Party shall issue (or cause its Affiliates to issue) a press release regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless both Parties have agreed upon the contents of any such public statement.

ARTICLE 19
MISCELLANEOUS

19.1 Entire Agreement; Integration; Exhibits. This Agreement, together with the Cover Sheet and Exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between Seller and Buyer with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to the subject matter hereof, which are of no further force or effect. The Exhibits attached hereto are integral parts hereof and are made a part of this Agreement by reference. The headings used herein are for convenience and reference purposes only. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of the Cover Sheet or any Exhibit, the provisions of first the Cover Sheet, and then this Agreement shall prevail, and such Exhibit shall be corrected accordingly.

19.3 No Waiver. Waiver by a Party of any default by the other Party shall not be construed as a waiver of any other default.

19.4 No Agency, Partnership, Joint Venture or Lease. Seller and the agents and employees of Seller shall, in the performance of this Agreement, act in an independent capacity and not as officers or employees or agents of Buyer. Under this Agreement, Seller and Buyer intend to act as energy service provider and energy service recipient, respectively, and do not intend to be treated as, and shall not act as, partners in, co-venturers in or lessor/lessee with respect to the Facility or any business related to the Facility. This Agreement shall not impart any rights enforceable by any third party (other than a permitted successor or assignee bound to this Agreement).

19.5 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable or held to be unenforceable, the Parties agree that all other provisions of this Agreement have force and effect and shall not be affected thereby. The Parties shall, however, use their best endeavors to agree on the replacement of the void, illegal or unenforceable provision(s) with legally acceptable clauses which correspond as closely as possible to the sense and purpose of the affected provision and this Agreement as a whole.

19.6 Mobile-Sierra. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party shall seek, nor shall they support, any third party seeking to prospectively or retroactively revise the rates, terms or conditions of service of this Agreement through application or complaint to FERC pursuant to the provisions of Section 205, 206 or 306 of the Federal Power Act, or any other provisions of the Federal Power Act, absent prior written agreement of the Parties. Further, absent the prior written agreement in writing by both Parties, the standard of review for changes to the rates, terms or conditions of service of this Agreement proposed by a Party shall be the “public interest” standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956) and Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348 (1956). Changes proposed by a non-Party to FERC acting sua sponte shall be subject to the most stringent standard permissible under applicable Law.

19.10 Change in Electric Market Design.

(a) If a change in the CAISO Tariff renders this Agreement or any provisions hereof incapable of being performed or administered, then any Party may request that Buyer and Seller enter into negotiations to make the minimum changes to this Agreement necessary to make this Agreement capable of being performed and administered, while attempting to preserve to the maximum extent possible the benefits, burdens, and obligations set forth in this Agreement as of the Effective Date. Upon delivery of such a request, Buyer and Seller shall engage in such negotiations in good faith. If Buyer and Seller are unable, within sixty (60) days after delivery of such request, to agree upon changes to this Agreement or to resolve issues relating to changes to this Agreement, then any Party may submit issues pertaining to changes to this Agreement to the dispute resolution process set forth in Article 15. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a change in cost shall not in and of itself be deemed to render this Agreement or any of the provisions hereof incapable of being performed or administered, or constitute, or form the basis of, a Force Majeure Event, and (ii) all of unaffected provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect during any period of such negotiation or dispute resolution.

(b) If the Point of Interconnection and/or any of the Transmission Systems utilized to deliver Product to the Delivery Point under this Agreement are (i) integrated into a new or existing regional transmission organization or independent system operator (other than the CAISO Balancing Authority), or (ii) leave a regional transmission organization or independent system operator, and such integration has a material and adverse impact on either Party’s performance under this Agreement, including the costs of either Party to perform, then the affected Party may request that Buyer and Seller enter into negotiations to make the minimum changes to this Agreement necessary to restore the balance of benefits, burdens, and obligations set forth in this Agreement as of the Effective Date. Upon delivery of such a request, Buyer and Seller shall engage in such negotiations in good faith; provided, that neither Party shall be obligated to amend this Agreement if such amendment(s) would materially adversely affect, or could reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on, any of such Party’s rights, benefits, risks and/or obligations under this Agreement.

1. Reserved.

2. Commercial Operation of the Facility. “Commercial Operation” means the condition existing when (i) Seller has fulfilled all of the conditions in Section 2.3 of the Agreement and (ii) Seller has confirmed to Buyer in writing that Commercial Operation has been achieved.

The “Commercial Operation Date” shall be the date on which Commercial Operation is achieved.

a. Seller shall use good faith efforts to cause Commercial Operation for the Facility to occur by the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date. Seller shall notify Buyer at least thirty (30) days before the anticipated Commercial Operation Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller may continue to increase the Installed Capacity of the Facility after the Commercial Operation Date and will notify Buyer from time to time of such increases by delivering a certificate from a Licensed Professional Engineer substantially in the form attached as Exhibit G hereto; when the Installed Capacity is complete, Seller shall include a statement to that effect in a Notice accompanying the final such certificate.

b. If Seller does not anticipate achieving Commercial Operation by the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, Seller may elect to extend the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date by paying Delay Damages to Buyer for each day Seller desires to extend the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date. If Seller elects to extend the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, on or before the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the then-current Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, Seller shall provide Notice and payment to Buyer of the Delay Damages for the number of days of extension to the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date (“Delay Damages Payment”); provided such Delay Damages Payment may, at Seller’s option, be in the form of cash or an irrevocable, standby letter of credit issued by a U.S. commercial bank, or a foreign bank with a U.S. branch, with such bank having a Credit Rating of at least A- with an outlook designation of “stable” from S&P or A3 with an outlook designation of “stable” from Moody’s, which letter of credit Buyer may draw on to receive such Delay Damages Payment. If Seller achieves Commercial Operation prior to the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date as extended by the payment of the Delay Damages Payment, Buyer shall refund to Seller in cash the Delay Damages for each day Seller achieves Commercial Operation prior to the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, as extended, times the Delay Damages, not to exceed the total amount of the Delay Damages Payment paid by Seller pursuant to this Section 2(b). The Parties agree that Buyer’s receipt of Delay Damages shall not be construed as Buyer’s declaration that an Event of Default has occurred under any provision of Section 11.1.

3. **Termination for Failure to Achieve Commercial Operation.** If the Facility has not achieved Commercial Operation by the Outside Commercial Operation Date, either Party may elect to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 2.6.

4. **Extension of the Guaranteed Dates.** The Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date shall, subject to notice and documentation requirements set forth below, be automatically extended on a day-for-day basis (the “Development Cure Period”) for the following delays:

   a. delays due to a Force Majeure Event;

   b. delays caused by a Transmission Provider not caused by the Seller’s action or inaction;

   c. delays in the completion of the Interconnection Facilities or the commercial operation date of the SunZia Transmission Line, in each case not caused by Seller’s action or inaction; or

   d. delay due to a Buyer breach or default under this Agreement.

   The cumulative extensions granted under clauses 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c) of the Development Cure Period shall not exceed __________ for any reason, including a Force Majeure Event. The extension granted under clause 4(d) of the Development Cure Period shall have no termination. Except to the extent Seller has paid Delay Damages, or due to a delay clause 4(d) of the Development Cure Period, no extension under the Development Cure Period, no extension shall be given if (i) the delay was the result of Seller’s failure to take all commercially reasonable actions to meet its specified deadlines, (ii) Seller failed to provide requested documentation as provided below, or (iii) Seller failed to provide Notice to Buyer as required in the next sentence. Seller shall provide prompt Notice to Buyer of a delay, but in no case more than thirty (30) days after Seller becomes aware of such delay, except that in the case of a delay occurring within sixty (60) days of the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, or after such date, Seller must provide Notice within five (5) Business Days of Seller becoming aware of such delay. Upon request from Buyer, Seller shall provide documentation demonstrating to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction that the delays described above did not result from Seller’s actions or failure to take commercially reasonable actions.

5. **Failure to Reach Guaranteed Capacity.** If, at Commercial Operation, one hundred percent (100%) of the Guaranteed Capacity has not been completed and is not ready to produce and deliver Product to Buyer, Seller shall have one hundred eighty (180) days after the Commercial Operation Date to install additional capacity and/or network upgrades such that the Installed Capacity is equal to at least the Guaranteed Capacity. In the event that Seller fails to construct the Guaranteed Capacity by such date, Seller shall pay “Capacity Damages” to Buyer, in an amount equal to __________ for each MW that the Guaranteed Capacity exceeds the Installed Capacity and the Guaranteed Capacity and other applicable portions of the Agreement shall be adjusted accordingly.

![EXHIBIT E ENERGY REPLACEMENT DAMAGES CALCULATION](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=EXHIBIT+E+ENERGY+REPLACEMENT+DAMAGES+CALCULATION)

In accordance with Section 4.7, if Seller fails to achieve the Guaranteed Energy Production during any Performance Measurement Period, and Seller elects to not provide Replacement Product, a liquidated damages (“Energy Replacement Damages”) payment shall be due from Seller to Buyer, calculated as follows:

\[
[(A - B) * (C - D)] - E
\]

where:

- **A** = the Guaranteed Energy Production amount for the Performance Measurement Period, in MWh
- **B** = the Adjusted Energy Production amount for the Performance Measurement Period, in MWh
- **C** = Replacement price for the Performance Measurement Period, in $/MWh, which is the sum of (a) the simple average of the LMP in the Day-Ahead Market at the Delivery Point for all of the hours in the Performance Measurement Period, plus (b) the simple average REC Price for the applicable Performance Measurement Period.
- **D** = the Contract Price, in $/MWh
- **E** = the value of any Replacement Product provided retrospectively by Seller with respect to such Performance Measurement Period

“Adjusted Energy Production” shall mean the sum of the following: (i) the greater of (a) if Seller provided Replacement Product or paid Energy Replacement Damages during the prior Performance Measurement Period, seventy five percent (75%) of the Expected Energy for the Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period or (b) the Delivered Energy plus Lost Output plus Deemed Delivered Energy in the first Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period, plus (ii) Delivered Energy plus Lost Output plus Deemed Delivered Energy in the second Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period.

“Lost Output” means the sum of electric energy in MWh that would have been generated and delivered, but was not, on account of Forced Facility Outage (not caused by Seller’s fault or negligence), Force Majeure Events, System Emergencies, Buyer’s failure to perform, and Curtailment Order. The additional MWh comprising Lost Output shall be calculated in the same manner as Deemed Delivered Energy.

No payment shall be due if the calculation of (A - B) or (C - D) yields a negative number.

Exhibit E-1

![EXHIBIT J FORM OF LIMITED ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1085.png?text=EXHIBIT+J+FORM+OF+LIMITED+ASSIGNMENT+AGREEMENT)

This Limited Assignment Agreement (this “Assignment Agreement” or “Agreement”) is entered into as of [____], by and among [____], a [____] (“PPA Seller”), Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a municipal utility district organized under the provisions of the Municipal Utility District Act (Division 6, Chapter 2, Articles 2 and 3, Sections 11581 through 11614 of the California Public Utilities Code, as amended) (“PPA Buyer”), and J. Aron & Company LLC, a New York limited liability company (“J. Aron”), and relates to that certain power purchase agreement between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller as further described in Appendix 1 (the “PPA”). Unless the context otherwise specifies or requires, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the PPA.

In consideration of the premises above and the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, PPA Seller, PPA Buyer and J. Aron (the “Parties” hereto; each is a “Party”) agree as follows:

1. Limited Assignment and Delegation.

   (a) PPA Buyer hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to J. Aron all right, title and interest in and to the rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA to receive delivery of the products described on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Products”) during the Assignment Period (as defined in Appendix 1), as such rights may be limited or further described in the “Further Information” section on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Product Rights”). All Assigned Products shall be delivered pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the Assignment Period as provided in Appendix 1. All other rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly reserved for PPA Buyer. The Parties agree that the assignment, transfer and/or conveyance of all or any portion of the Assigned Products in accordance with this Agreement and the Parties’ performance of any obligation in accordance with this Agreement shall not constitute a failure to meet the requirements of the PPA, or a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty under the PPA (and in no event shall PPA Seller be responsible for any failure of any portion of the Assigned Products to satisfy the requirements of the PPA, to the extent such failure results from the assignment, transfer and/or conveyance of such Assigned Products in accordance with this Agreement).

   (b) PPA Buyer hereby delegates to J. Aron the obligation to pay the APC Contract Price set forth in Appendix 1 for all Assigned Products that are actually delivered to J. Aron pursuant to the Assigned Product Rights during the Assignment Period (the “Delivered Product Payment Obligation” and together with the Assigned Product Rights, collectively the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”); provided that (i) all other obligations of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly retained by PPA Buyer and PPA Buyer shall be solely responsible for any amounts due to PPA Seller that are not directly related to Assigned Products; and (ii) the Parties acknowledge and agree that PPA Seller will only be obligated to deliver a single consolidated invoice during the Assignment Period (with a copy to J. Aron consistent with Section 1(d) hereof). To the extent J. Aron fails to pay for any Assigned Products by the due date for payment set forth in the PPA, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, PPA Buyer agrees that it will remain jointly and severally responsible as a primary obligor (and not as a surety) for such payment and that it will be an Event of Default pursuant to Section 11.1(a) if PPA Buyer does not make such payment within -1- 84ET-387872
<!-- Page 209 -->
five (5) Business Days (as defined in the PPA) of receiving notice of such non-payment from PPA Seller, and that PPA Buyer shall remain liable for, and indemnify and hold PPA Seller harmless from, any and all losses, damages, costs and expenses of PPA Seller of any kind as a result of or arising from (x) the assignment, transfer, conveyance, and delegation described in Section 1(a) and this Section 1(b), or (y) J. Aron’s failure to take or pay for any such Assigned Product or make any payment in respect of the Delivered Product Payment Obligation as and when due under the PPA and disregarding the effects of any stay or other suspension rights, including without limitation under sections 362 or 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or similar laws, whether due to bankruptcy, insolvency or any other cause.

(c) J. Aron hereby accepts and PPA Seller hereby consents and agrees to the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delegation described in clauses (a) and (b) above.

(d) All scheduling of Assigned Products and other communications related to the PPA shall take place between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller pursuant to the terms of the PPA; provided that (i) title to Assigned Product will pass from PPA Seller to J. Aron upon delivery by PPA Seller of Assigned Product in accordance with the PPA; (ii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any Notice of a Force Majeure Event or Event of Default or default, breach or other occurrence that, if not cured within the applicable grace period, could result in an Event of Default contemporaneously upon delivery thereof to PPA Seller and promptly after receipt thereof from PPA Seller; (iii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any forecasts of Energy generation provided by PPA Seller under the PPA; (iv) PPA Seller will provide copies to J. Aron of all invoices and supporting data provided to PPA Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1 of the PPA, provided that any payment adjustments or subsequent reconciliations occurring after the date that is 10 days prior to the payment due date for a monthly invoice, including pursuant to Section 8.4 of the PPA, will be resolved solely between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller and therefore PPA Seller will not be obligated to deliver copies of any communications relating thereto to J. Aron; and (v) PPA Buyer and PPA Seller, as applicable, will provide copies to J. Aron of any other information reasonably requested by J. Aron relating to Assigned Products.

(e) PPA Seller acknowledges that (i) J. Aron intends to immediately transfer title to any Assigned Products received from PPA Seller through one or more intermediaries such that all Assigned Products will be re-delivered to PPA Buyer; and (ii) in the event that PPA Buyer fails to pay the relevant intermediary entity for any such Assigned Products, the receivables owed by PPA Buyer for such Assigned Products (“PPA Buyer Receivables”) may be transferred to J. Aron. To the extent any such PPA Buyer Receivables are transferred to J. Aron, J. Aron may transfer such PPA Buyer Receivables to PPA Seller and apply the face amount thereof as a reduction to any Delivered Product Payment Obligation, and PPA Buyer waives all rights to dispute or claim any defence in respect of such PPA Buyer Receivables other than a defence that would have arisen under the PPA if this Agreement were not in effect. To effect such transfer, J. Aron shall deliver to PPA Seller a notice of intent to transfer PPA Buyer Receivables not later than the payment due date for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation and shall deliver to PPA Seller a bill of sale signed by J. Aron not later than five Business Days thereafter, provided that no such transfer or application shall reduce or limit PPA Buyer’s obligations under Section1(b) above. Such transfer of PPA Buyer Receivables shall immediately be deemed an Event of Default under Section 11.1(a) of the PPA, without regard to any cure periods set forth therein, and PPA Seller shall be entitled to pursue collection on such PPA Buyer Receivables.
<!-- Page 210 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1085.png?text=Document+Image)

directly against PPA Buyer pursuant to the remedies set forth in the PPA for such Event of Default.

(f) On or before the commencement of the Assignment Period, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Guarantor”) will issue, in favor of PPA Seller, a guaranty of J. Aron’s payment obligations under this Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Appendix 3 attached hereto (“Guaranty”).

(g) The Assigned Prepay Quantity set forth in Appendix 2 relates to obligations by and between J. Aron and PPA Buyer and has no impact on PPA Seller’s rights and obligations under the PPA.

(h) In the event that the PPA or the Assigned Rights and obligations are either or both rejected or terminated in or as a result of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding affecting J. Aron, PPA Buyer shall, at the option of PPA Seller exercised within thirty (30) days after such rejection or termination, enter into a new agreement with PPA Seller having identical terms as the PPA (subject to any conforming changes necessitated by the substitution of parties and other changes as the parties may mutually agree), provided, that the term under such new agreement shall be no longer than the remaining balance of the term specified in the PPA.

2. Assignment Early Termination.

(a) The Assignment Period may be terminated early upon the occurrence of any of the following:

(1) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by either J. Aron or PPA Buyer to each of the other Parties;

(2) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by PPA Seller to each of J. Aron and PPA Buyer following J. Aron’s failure to pay when due any amounts owed to PPA Seller in respect of any Delivered Product Payment Obligation and such payment is not made by J. Aron within one (1) business day following receipt by J. Aron and PPA Buyer of written notice;

(3) delivery of a written notice by PPA Seller if any of the events described in the definition of “Bankrupt” in the PPA occurs with respect to J. Aron; or

(4) delivery of a written notice by J. Aron if any of the events described in the definition of “Bankrupt” in the PPA occurs with respect to PPA Seller.

(b) The Assignment Period will end at the end of last delivery hour on the date specified in the termination notice provided pursuant to Section 2(a), which date shall not be earlier than the end of the last day of the calendar month in which such notice is delivered if termination is pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) or 2(a)(2) above. All Assigned Rights and Obligations shall revert from J. Aron to PPA Buyer upon the early termination of the Assignment Period, provided that (i) J. Aron shall remain responsible for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation with respect to any Assigned Product delivered to J. Aron prior to the end of the Assignment Period, and (ii) any legal restrictions on the effectiveness of such reversion (whether arising under bankruptcy law or otherwise) shall not affect the expiration or early termination of the Assignment Period.

Aron shall remain responsible for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation with respect to any Assigned Product delivered to J.

Aron that (a) the PPA is in full force and effect; (b) to the best of its knowledge, no event or circumstance exists (or would exist with the passage of time or the giving of notice) that would give either of them the right to terminate the PPA or suspend performance thereunder; and (c) all of its obligations under the PPA required to be performed on or before the Assignment Period Start Date have been fulfilled.

**NAME**  
**ADDRESS**  

Attention:

Ladies and Gentlemen:

For value received, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Guarantor”), a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, hereby unconditionally guarantees the prompt and complete payment when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations and liabilities, whether now in existence or hereafter arising, of J. Aron & Company LLC, a subsidiary of the Guarantor and a limited liability company duly organized under the laws of the State of New York (the “Company”), to **COUNTERPARTY NAME** (the “Counterparty”) arising out of or under the Limited Assignment Agreement among the Company, the Counterparty and [PPA Seller] dated as of [ | , 202_]. This Guaranty is one of payment and not of collection.

The Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and notice of any obligation or liability to which it may apply, and waives presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any such obligation or liability, suit or the taking of other action by Counterparty against, and any other notice to, the Company, the Guarantor or others.

Counterparty may at any time and from time to time without notice to or consent of the Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder: (1) agree with the Company to make any change in the terms of any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (2) take or fail to take any action of any kind in respect of any security for any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (3) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company or others, or (4) compromise or subordinate any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty including any security therefor. Any other surety defenses are hereby waived by the Guarantor.

This Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect until the opening of business on the fifth business day after Counterparty receives written notice of termination from the Guarantor. It is understood and agreed, however, that notwithstanding any such termination this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the obligations and liabilities set forth above which shall have been incurred prior to such termination.

84ET-387782
<!-- Page 218 -->
![Exhibit J-3](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Exhibit+J-3)

The Guarantor further agrees that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the guaranteed obligations, or interest thereon is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Counterparty upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or reorganization of the Company. No failure on the part of the Counterparty to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Counterparty of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power. Notwithstanding anything in this Guaranty to the contrary, this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time, either before or after the termination hereof, payment of the obligations or liabilities guaranteed pursuant to this Guaranty, or any part thereof, is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Counterparty for any reason, including without limitation upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or the Guarantor, all as though such payment had not been made.

Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, Guarantor hereby agrees that no delay of Counterparty in the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights or a release of Guarantor from any obligations hereunder.

No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, waived or supplemented except in a writing signed by Guarantor and Counterparty.

The Guarantor hereby represents as follows:

(a) The Guarantor is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Guaranty have been and remain duly authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of the Guarantor's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, as amended to date, or any law, regulation, decree, order, judgment, resolution or any contractual restriction binding on the Guarantor or its assets that could affect, in a materially adverse manner, the ability of the Guarantor to perform any of its obligations hereunder.

(c) All consents, licenses, clearances, authorizations, and approvals of, and registration and declarations with, any governmental or regulatory authority necessary for the due execution and delivery of this Guaranty have been obtained and remain in full force and effect and all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental or regulatory authority is required in connection with the execution or delivery of this Guaranty.

(d) This Guaranty constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with all of its terms and conditions (subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar law).

**Exhibit J-4**  
**THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.**  

The Guarantor may not assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Guaranty, in whole or in part, without prior written consent of the Counterparty, and any purported assignment or delegation absent such consent is void, except for (i) an assignment and delegation of all of the Guarantor’s rights and obligations hereunder in whatever form the Guarantor determines may be appropriate to a partnership, corporation, trust or other organization in whatever form that succeeds to all or substantially all of the Guarantor’s assets and business and that assumes such obligations by contract, operation of law or otherwise, and (ii) the Guarantor may transfer this Guaranty or any interest or obligation of the Guarantor in or under this Guaranty, or any property securing this Guaranty, to another entity as transferee as part of the resolution, restructuring or reorganization of the Guarantor upon or following the Guarantor becoming subject to a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding. Upon any such delegation and assumption or transfer of obligations, the Guarantor shall be relieved of and fully discharged from all obligations hereunder, whether such obligations arose before or after such delegation and assumption or transfer.

**THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. GUARANTOR AGREES TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, OVER ANY DISPUTES ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY.**

In the event the Guarantor becomes subject to a proceeding under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together, the "U.S. Special Resolution Regimes"), the transfer of this Guaranty, and any interest and obligation in or under, and any property securing, this Guaranty, from the Guarantor will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Guaranty, and any interest and obligation in or under this Guaranty, were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event the Company or the Guarantor, or any of their affiliates, becomes subject to a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, default rights against the Company or the Guarantor with respect to this Guaranty are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such default rights could be exercised under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Guaranty was governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.

Very truly yours,  
**THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.**

# PRINCIPLES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT

SMUD is committed to developing carbon free renewable energy in a manner that supports the community, protects the environment, and respects human rights. This document provides guidance on the key objectives that SMUD expects to achieve associated with this commitment. Renewable energy projects engaged in a commercial relationship with SMUD such as a power purchase agreement will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, implement, and maintain throughout the associated term, a “Community Benefits Plan” that addresses how the project will achieve the key objectives identified herein.

## Key objectives:

1. **Land Use:** Prioritize previously developed lands. Avoid or minimize impacts on sensitive environmental resources, including but not limited to cultural resources, tribal cultural resources, and biological resources such as endangered species habitat, vernal pools and other sensitive habitats, “Waters of the US”, “Waters of the State” and waters identified by California Department of Fish and Wildlife as “Streambed”. Provide additional mitigation measures if avoidance and minimization measures cannot fully eliminate impacts. Applicants are expected to discuss these topics with both SMUD and the lead agency as early as possible to identify potential associated issues in advance of the purchase power agreement being finalized.

2. **Land Use:** All projects should employ techniques for maintaining and/or restoring ecosystem function to the site in conjunction with renewable energy outcomes, including establishment of native vegetation, restricting use of herbicides and pesticides, use of grazing for vegetation management and seasonally appropriate maintenance practices. Where development is on or surrounded by agricultural lands the project should also employ agricultural practices on the property during operations including sheep grazing, dry crop farming and irrigated food production where feasible.

3. **Land Use:** Employ design and construction practices that minimize ground disturbance to the maximum extent possible. This is especially critical in areas where cultural, tribal and biological resources are of significant concern.

4. **Sustainable Life Cycle Management:** Include plans for sustainable life cycle management of construction materials and project components during construction and operation that provides for recycling and reuse of construction waste and waste during operation including but not limited to the solar panels.

5. **Community Benefits:**
   - (a) **Inclusive Economic Development:** Leverage SMUD’s Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) team to connect with certified small business vendors/contractors in SMUD’s service territory to support the project. Submit requests to seed.mgr@smud.org.

1) Background

Strategic Direction Information Management and Security policy states that:

Proper management of cyber and physical information, as well as physical security, is a core value. Robust information management and physical security practices are critical to effective risk management and to ensure regulatory compliance, business resiliency and customer satisfaction. SMUD shall take prudent and reasonable measures to accomplish the following:

a) Information Security: SMUD will protect customer, employee and third-party information, and SMUD information systems are protected from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

b) Physical Security: SMUD will safeguard its employees while at work as well as customers and visitors at SMUD facilities. SMUD will also protect its facilities and functions that support the reliability of the electric system and overall operation of the organization from unauthorized access or disruption of business operations.

c) Customer Privacy: SMUD will annually notify customers about the collection, use and dissemination of sensitive and confidential customer information. Except as provided by law or for a business purpose, SMUD will not disseminate sensitive and confidential customer information to a third party for non-SMUD business purposes unless the customer first consents to the release of the information. Where sensitive and confidential information is disseminated for a business purpose, SMUD will ensure: (i) the third party has robust information practices to protect the sensitive and confidential customer information, and (ii) use of the information by the third party is limited to SMUD’s business purpose. SMUD will maintain a process that identifies the business purposes for which SMUD will collect, use and disseminate sensitive and confidential customer information.

d) Records Management: SMUD will maintain the efficient and systematic control of the creation, capture, identification, receipt, maintenance, use, disposition, and destruction of SMUD records, in accordance with legal requirements and Board policies.

2) Executive summary

a) SMUD’s Information Security, Physical Security, Customer Privacy, and Records Management programs and initiatives align directly with the “Safety and Reliability” Core Values of SMUD’s 2030 Clean Energy Plan. These programs work towards ensuring

### 3) Additional supporting information

**Information Security**  
SMUD, customer, employee and third-party information and SMUD information systems are protected from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

SMUD’s Cybersecurity program, under the direction of the Chief Information Security Officer, continues to evolve and mature to keep pace with the evolving cyber threats we face and to manage our cyber, privacy, legal, regulatory and compliance risk. This includes the adoption of a Zero Trust Architecture strategy, aligned to the CIOs larger IT Strategic Plan. We align to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to establish prudent and reasonable measures intended to protect SMUD’s operations from a cyber-attack, disruption and other threats to enterprise technologies, processes, and information. The CSF has been updated to now have six core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover, and Govern) which comprise both administrative and technical controls to effectively manage information and cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity is actively working to implement the CSF controls through SMUD policies to enhance and govern information management and security risk management practices and processes in support of SD-16. Cybersecurity will highlight the cybersecurity capabilities provided in an update to the board for SD-16 during an upcoming closed session.

**Physical Security**  
SMUD will safeguard its employees while at work as well as customers and visitors at SMUD facilities.

SMUD facilities welcome thousands of community members through community events, meetings, and face-to-face interactions in addition to being the home of nearly 2300 employees.

![SMUD's Security Operations Report](https://example.com/image-url)

SMUD’s Security Operations continues to meet its goal of maintaining customer and employee safety by leveraging physical security staff, video surveillance technology, lighting and signage, passive and active physical security barriers, education and partnerships with law enforcement and community stakeholders.

This year, SMUD authored and implemented a comprehensive new Visitor Control and Management policy. This policy outlines the requirements for planning, coordinating, escorting and approving visits throughout SMUD. The new policy ensures uniform, consistent, safe and efficient processes for visitors and SMUD employees. SMUD additionally added an enhanced Workplace Violence Prevention policy and training for all employees. These safeguards and policies ensure that safety remains priority one at SMUD. As with most new policies and procedures, these will be updated appropriately when needed to reflect the ever-changing threat landscape.

SMUD will also protect its facilities and functions that support the reliability of the electric system and overall operation of the organization from unauthorized access or disruption of business operations.

Security Operations has identified a new thermal imaging technology that will be used to supplement existing intrusion detection methods at substations and other sites where false alarms have been rampant. This system “sees” things thermally and then directs a camera to the detected object for the Security Dispatcher to assess. This will help with an aging fiber optic sensor system that has been giving widespread false alarms for years. The resulting drain on resources and unnecessary patrol response has been a costly issue, and introducing this new system should reduce those problems significantly. This is part of a larger effort to use metrics-gathering tools to increase operational efficiency, identify trends and hotspots, and increase visibility of emergent issues, particularly at our Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) sites.

**Customer Privacy**

SMUD will annually notify customers about the collection, use and dissemination of sensitive and confidential customer information.

SMUD sent out our annual privacy notice via email and as a bill insert to customers during the May bill cycle. The language in the notice was updated this year to emphasize that any non-SMUD business uses of personal information require individual consent. The notice is otherwise very similar to previous years and continues to include plain language regarding SMUD’s collection, use, and release of customer sensitive and confidential information, the business purposes for which customer information is used, as well as a reaffirmation of SMUD’s commitment to customer privacy.

Except as provided by law or for a business purpose, SMUD will not disseminate sensitive and confidential customer information to a third party for non-SMUD business purposes unless the customer first consents to the release of the.

GM 24-163 Board Monitoring Report – SD-16, Information Management and Security Page 4 of 8
<!-- Page 237 -->
![GM 24-163 Board Monitoring Report – SD-16, Information Management and Security Page 5 of 8](attachment://image.png)

No sensitive and confidential customer information has been sent to a third party for non-SMUD business purposes this year.

Where sensitive and confidential information is disseminated for a business purpose, SMUD will ensure: (i) the third party has robust information practices to protect the sensitive and confidential customer information, and (ii) use of the information by the third party is limited to SMUD’s business purpose.

Cybersecurity and Procurement continue to follow a formalized supply chain risk management process, in compliance with NERC CIP requirements. The process is aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and is reviewed on at least an annual basis to ensure it is functioning as designed and incorporates lessons learned as new procurements follow the process. The process includes a mandatory procurement requirement for vendors to allow the Cybersecurity team to evaluate the security posture of a proposed vendor solution. The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2) Type 2 continues to be our procurement standard as it is an independent assessment focused on a solution’s security controls which includes tests of the security controls’ efficacy. SOC 2 Type 2 reports provide staff confidence that vendor security controls are robust and sufficient to protect SMUD information. Contract and non-disclosure agreement language is used to provide assurance that SMUD provided sensitive and confidential information will not be used for any unapproved purposes. Additionally, our data sharing policy and process also align to this requirement.

SMUD will maintain a process that identifies the business purposes for which SMUD will collect, use and disseminate sensitive and confidential customer information.

MP 07.03.01.122 - Data Sharing requires an approved data sharing request prior to sharing information with a third party for SMUD business purposes. No significant policy or process changes related to data sharing occurred this year.

Records Management

The efficient and systematic control of the creation, capture, identification, receipt, maintenance, use, disposition, and destruction of SMUD records, in accordance with legal requirements and Board policies.

The IMC Program in collaboration with the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) team launched a mass content migration (Enterprise Shared Drive Migration) project at the beginning of 2023. Using completed IMC records evaluations, this effort has migrated or is in the process of migrating content from 29 business areas out of the 41 business areas in scope, for an estimated total of 4.5 million documents classified and migrated. The project identifies, organizes, and migrates content for each business area from non-approved records repositories.

![GM 24-163 Board Monitoring Report – SD-16, Information Management and Security Page 6 of 8](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=GM+24-163+Board+Monitoring+Report+%E2%80%93+SD-16,+Information+Management+and+Security+Page+6+of+8)

into approved record repositories. This allows content to be managed in accordance with SD-16.

The IMC program is continuing to partner with IT to review and support new software integrations to ensure they meet records policies and information management requirements. This is imperative as new software often produces and stores records outside of official repositories. IMC has been added to the purchase approval process to support this effort.

The IMC Program continues to collaborate with the Enterprise Content Management team, Cybersecurity, the CIP Program, Data Governance, and other business partners to ensure compliance with records policies and information management requirements.

4) Challenges

Information Security  
Our federal partners (FBI) continue to warn us of the heightened geopolitical tension and the nation state cyber actors targeting critical infrastructure that led to the “Shields Up” declaration from the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) from 2022, stressing the continued need to focus on maturing our cybersecurity posture. The Cybersecurity team continued to work this past year with numerous IT teams to follow CISA guidance to help manage the cyber risk. Internally facing awareness campaigns continue to remind staff of the risks we’re facing and the role they play in keeping our systems and data protected. In addition to the technical controls put in place, cybersecurity again partnered with other departments to ensure our cyber insurance coverage is maintained.

SMUD’s Payment Card Industry (PCI) card payment transaction volume makes SMUD a PCI Level 2 Merchant. This year the new updated version 4 of the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) went live. As determined by an independent third-party PCI Qualified Security Assessor, we are compliant with the new version. Our required assessment documents attesting to our compliance with the updated standards were submitted to Chase Paymentech in June.

The Cybersecurity team continues to work hard to ensure compliance with the NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards. Additional standards become enforceable in 2025 and subsequent years which will require additional resources from the Cybersecurity team and other teams as well.

Ransomware continues to be a threat, and in response SMUD Cybersecurity has continued to mature our Cybersecurity Emergency Operations Program (CEOP), performing annual exercises to ensure our teams understand the plan and are prepared to execute it in the event of a security incident. The exercises highlight ways we can improve our processes.

Cybersecurity’s Zero-Trust Strategy is a core part of the larger IT strategy, and better positions SMUD to secure sensitive data, systems, and services. IT continues to make progress in this area, working with Cybersecurity to ensure upcoming projects and efforts align to this strategy.

![Physical Security](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Physical+Security)

**Physical Security**  
Physical Security is a first line of defense against any unauthorized intrusions at our facilities. With the ever-changing international and domestic threat landscape, as well as the significant increase in unsafe activity located near SMUD campuses, sub-stations and other assets, the risk of outside impacts to SMUD assets and field staff continues to increase. SMUD Security Operations continues to invest in technology, increased training and adoption of best practices as well as partnerships with local and federal law enforcement and local community and government agencies to ensure we are prepared to meet and withstand current threat conditions in support of our employees, physical assets and the community we serve.

SMUD continues to grow as an organization in size and reputation, gaining national and international attention as one of the best public utilities in the world and as an economic development driver in the Sacramento region. As such, our infrastructure and facilities footprint continue to grow as we move toward our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. As SMUD continues to grow our influence, impact and footprint, our threat exposure grows as well.

SMUD Security Operations continues to work to ensure compliance with the NERC CIP standards while meeting the SMUD Strategic Directives. Balancing SMUD’s management of critical CIP areas while maintaining our role as a community convener and customer facing campus will continue to offer challenges. As CIP standards are adopted in 2025 and into the future, SMUD Security Operations will continue to evaluate our program to ensure that SMUD continues to have sufficient resources from a personnel, technology and security infrastructure standpoint to meet future needs, responsibilities and conditions.

**Customer Privacy**  
SMUD continues to see requests for SMUD customer data to be used and shared for additional purposes and programs, including customer personally identifiable information (PII). SMUD’s Data Sharing Policy and process are in place to provide request tracking and approval to ensure that all sharing of PII is authorized and that transmission is performed using an approved and secure transfer mechanism.

**Records Management**  
The IMC program continues to integrate information management best practices into SMUD’s daily operations. Business areas are actively collaborating with IMC in the creation of information management and recordkeeping polices/procedures specific to their day-to-day operational needs. SMUD’s continued development of the IMC program further reduces the risk of potential multi-million-dollar fines and reputational damage associated with lack of records management controls.

The Enterprise Shared Drive Migration project which launched at the beginning of 2023 (expected to end in 2025) is a large undertaking that involves the mass organization and migration of content from Enterprise shared drives to approved SMUD information repositories. IMC in collaboration with the ECM team is working diligently to ensure completion of the project tasks by business areas and ease the learning curve that comes with these implemented.

changes. We have created documentation that helps with the classification of the records as well as training to ease the transition into using a new repository. This project will ensure SMUD stays in line with information management industry best practices, create an environment of purposeful organization and generate information management symmetry across SMUD.
