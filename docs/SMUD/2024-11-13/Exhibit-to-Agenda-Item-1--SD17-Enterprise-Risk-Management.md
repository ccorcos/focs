**SD-17 Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)**

Effectively balancing and managing risk to further SMUD’s policies and business goals is a core value of SMUD.

Therefore:
SMUD will implement and maintain an integrated enterprise risk management process that identifies, assesses, prudently manages and mitigates a variety of risks facing SMUD, including financial, supply, operational, physical and cyber security, climate change, legal, legislative and regulatory, and reputational risk.

**SMUD is compliant with SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management Policy**
