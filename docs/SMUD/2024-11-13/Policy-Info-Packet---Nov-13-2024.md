# Board Monitoring Report 2024  
## SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management  

### 1. Background  
Strategic Direction 17 states that:  
Effectively balancing and managing risk to further SMUD’s policies and business goals is a core value of SMUD.  

Therefore:  
SMUD will implement and maintain an integrated enterprise risk management process that identifies, assesses, prudently manages, and mitigates a variety of risks facing SMUD, including financial, supply, operational, physical and cyber security, climate change, legal, legislative and regulatory, and reputational risk.  

### 2. Executive summary  
SMUD is in compliance with SD-17 Enterprise Risk Management. SMUD strategically manages risk to proactively reduce the chance of loss and take advantage of opportunities that support SMUD’s mission. In addition, as presented to the Policy Committee in June 2024, SMUD is maturing its risk management framework and reporting structure, the results of which will be presented to the Board in 2025 through Policy Committee updates ahead of the next Annual Monitoring Report.  

In preparation for the 2024 Annual Monitoring Report, staff interviewed and surveyed management to determine current risk levels. Enterprise risks are assessed by impact, likelihood and velocity to determine residual risk, or the risk remaining after mitigations and internal controls have been implemented.  

Overall, SMUD’s residual risk exposure has remained steady at medium/high. In many cases, the probability or potential impact of an adverse event increased, but SMUD leveraged its risk framework successfully to introduce new controls or mitigations that allowed the residual risk level to stay the same.  

Summarized below is the current Residual Risk Exposure over a three-year period.  

| Residual Risk Exposure | Nov. 2022 | Nov. 2023 | Nov. 2024 |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| “Red”: Extremely High Residual Exposure | 0         | 0         | 0         |
| “Orange”: High Residual Exposure | 6         | 5         | 5         |
| “Yellow”: Medium Residual Exposure | 39        | 40        | 41        |
| “Green”: Low Residual Exposure | 38        | 40        | 39        |
| “Blue”: Extremely Low Residual Exposure | 0         | 0         | 0         |
| **Total** | **83**    | **85**    | **85**    |

Although the counts remain the same from 2023 to 2024, we had two changes to risk levels:  
- Business agility – Changed from “Yellow” or medium to “Green” or low  
- Demand response – Changed from “Green” or low to “Yellow” or medium  

GM 24-162 Board Monitoring Report – SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management Page 1 of 15
<!-- Page 8 -->
![Board Monitoring Report - SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management](https://example.com/image.png)

- Employee Safety was incorrectly categorized as “Green” or low in 2023 SD-17 Monitoring Report and has been corrected to “Yellow” or medium in 2024.

Staff continues to implement risk mitigation strategies to balance residual risk exposures. There are currently 46 risks, shown in the last two lines of the table, which are within the risk management goal.

| Current Residual Risk Exposure | Risk Management Goal | Number of Risks |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Orange “high”                  | Yellow “medium”      | 5                |
| Yellow “medium”                | Green “low”          | 34               |
| Yellow “medium”                | Yellow “medium”      | 7                |
| Green “low”                    | Green “low”          | 39               |

Changes to SMUD’s risk landscape this year include increased cyber events, physical security concerns, disruptive technology, global and political unrest, supply chain shortages, and continued unprecedented weather events. SMUD is focused on building resiliency measures into our enterprise risk management practices to be better able to monitor and respond to hazards or uncertainties and adapt to a rapidly changing risk landscape.

### 3. Additional Supporting Information

#### A. 2024 Risk Management Highlights

In 2024, ERM continued to:
- support the organization by facilitating risk conversations, supporting special projects, and providing a uniform risk framework
- enhance cross-functional discussion and thorough understanding of major risk issues by leveraging five committees, including the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee (EROC), Risk Champions Network (RCN), Trading Operations Risk Committee (TORC), Zero Carbon Plan Steering Committee, and the Three Lines Working Team

In terms of new efforts, ERM began a refresh of its risk framework to better anticipate and accommodate our changing risk landscape. Internal Audit Services and KPMG, a global consulting firm, completed a maturity assessment of SMUD’s Enterprise Risk Management program in April 2024 to identify potential areas for improvement. Results from the maturity assessment were presented to the Policy Committee in June 2024. SMUD incorporated several changes into how we manage enterprise risk in support of their recommendations. To that end, SMUD:
- realigned the Enterprise Risk Management function with Strategy
- created the new Enterprise Strategy & Risk team under the Chief Financial Officer
- hired and onboarded a new Enterprise Risk Program Manager
- aligned and coordinated commodity risk reporting with overall enterprise risk reporting on a quarterly basis
- continued to support decision-making during the enterprise prioritization, planning and budget process
- Created a plan for further ERM enhancements and implementation of KPMG recommendations in 2025

In addition, SMUD completed several efforts in 2024 to reduce the impact of risk in the areas of reliability, safety and supply chain. Highlights of those efforts are provided below.

![Contractor Code of Conduct](https://example.com/image.png)

**Contractor Code of Conduct**  
In 2024, staff implemented a new Contractor Code of Conduct to help mitigate supply chain risk and continue providing a safe, reliable and sustainable grid for the future. The Code of Conduct outlines how staff will recruit contractors – and their employees and subcontractors – who share SMUD’s vision. With their collaboration, SMUD is aiming to create a supply chain that collectively contributes to building a greener, more sustainable future. The Code of Conduct outlines specific guidelines that ensure compliance with; laws, rules and regulations, labor and human rights, environmental and social, health and safety, diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, and ethics and compliance.

**CrowdStrike Response**  
In July 2024, SMUD was one of many entities affected by a worldwide CrowdStrike information technology (IT) outage, which impacted Microsoft Windows applications. Staff acted promptly to alert support teams and communicate the cause and the solution. IT teams moved swiftly, prioritizing our most important systems and working through the night to bring systems back online. Due to our internal teams’ hard work and dedication, systems were back online quickly, and we were fully recovered in a matter of days, without having to pay for external recovery specialist services. The incident demonstrated the successful operation of our controls around business continuity, which is an Enterprise Risk.

**Storm Response Team**  
For a second year in a row, extreme weather interrupted power to thousands of SMUD customers as strong winds gusted persistently for several hours in February 2024. However, preparations conducted over the prior year significantly improved our speed of restoration and accuracy of estimated restoration times. SMUD was able to provide customers with new status information, letting them know when crews were scheduled to restore their power and when crews arrived on site. More staff was placed in the field by leveraging pre-existing contracts, training meter and substation staff to respond to damage reports and calling on retired annuitants. We used new technologies and processes to synthesize the data coming back to rapidly build a restoration schedule and were able to track and beat the schedule over the recovery period. This storm provided a first test of the improvements we implemented last year and showed significant impact to our customers' experiences. We will continue to build on these successes and iteratively enhance the processes for next year.

**Supply Chain Enhancements**  
Several enhancements were completed in 2024 to reduce the impact of supply chain shortages on SMUD’s operations. Staff held regular recurring business review and demand planning meetings across several operational areas primarily focused on construction, material, and equipment contractors. Staff also implemented two multi-million bulk purchasing efforts, the first to bring on additional substation resources at 200 million and the second to decrease the cost and lead times of transformers at 250 million.

**Insurance Recovery**  
To mitigate the financial impact of business disruption risks such as asset outages, SMUD has commercial insurance policies. In 2024, SMUD completed collections on two large insurance claims. We received final settlement of the Consumers Power Plant (CPP) business interruption claim resulting in recovery of an additional $88.9 million in 2024, for a total claim recovery of $152 million (equipment loss and business interruption). This year SMUD also finished collecting the $7.5 million insurance payout for the Station A fire in 2021. These funds offset prior costs and will support lower rate increases going forward.

**B. Benchmarking**

North Carolina State University’s (NCSU) Enterprise Risk Management Initiative and Protiviti continue to jointly publish benchmark information. The joint study, 2024 & 2034 Executive Perspectives on Top Risks, provides insight for short-term and long-term risks from 1,443 global board members and executives from across several industries.

Overall, the study found that risks are becoming increasingly interrelated and pose significant challenges to current business models and the ability of modern organizations to be resilient and agile. As the risks associated with the pandemic subside, concerns around several emerging risks and uncertainty in the world is causing risk exposure to rise. Today’s executive concerns continue to be focused on cybersecurity, third-party, talent and workforce management, and political and economic uncertainty, but the emerging risks associated with disruptive technologies, climate change, and regulatory changes are changing how risk is managed. Specific to the energy and utility industry, executives are more focused on the operational risks around cybersecurity, supply chain and weather-related risks, but found that their organizations were becoming more adaptable and better able to respond to events. In addition to operational concerns, the risks associated with regulatory and legislative changes ranked high for energy and utility leaders. Attachment B compares SMUD’s top enterprise risks to the top 10 Energy and Utility risks identified in NCSU and Protiviti study.

**C. Risk Focus Areas & Global Risk Trends**

As described in last year’s SD-17 Annual Report, SMUD leaders selected 16 risk focus areas in 2023. Risk focus areas have a high potential to impact the achievement of SMUD’s goals and strategic objectives in the upcoming year and are therefore areas of emphasis for our risk committees and investment decisions. This year, SMUD added two risks, Changing Customer Expectations and Grid Infrastructure and Operational Adequacy, for a total of 18 risk focus areas.

Attachment A outlines each risk focus area and the actions that have been taken to address these risks. Provided below is a synopsis of increasing global risk since the 2023 Board update that may cause risk focus areas to trend upward. These changes are also examples of the type of information tracked and reported by SMUD’s risk management functions.

Global risk trends impacting SMUD’s 2023-2024 risk focus areas:

- **Political and Regulatory Uncertainty:** There are potential effects of the upcoming November elections on the energy industry, specifically related to grant funding and regulation changes. Moreover, at the State level there are ever-evolving regulations as California manages the energy transition. This creates a level of uncertainty that deserves attention. Reliably delivering zero carbon power in an increasingly interconnected energy landscape will require coordination and collaboration between federal and state policy makers, regulators, owners, and operators.

- **Climate Change and Severe Weather:** Climate change continues to pose some of the biggest areas of uncertainty. Four characteristics make it especially impactful amongst other risks. That is its global nature, its long-term consequences, the fact that it is potentially irreversible, and the almost overwhelming uncertainty surrounding its progression and effects.

- **Third-Party and Supply Chain Risk:** Uncertainty around supply chain issues in the energy and utility industry has diminished since its peak during the pandemic. However, concerns remain high given how the energy industry’s value chain is highly service, feedstock, parts, and equipment oriented. Disruptions related to global events such as

**GM 24-162 Board Monitoring Report - SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management Page 4 of 15**
<!-- Page 11 -->
![Board Monitoring Report – SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management](https://example.com/image.png)

geopolitical tensions or labor strikes at the Ports threaten to inhibit a utility’s ability to secure the equipment needed to maintain existing and build new infrastructure. Additionally, there is risk in testing new business models working with untested partners as the grid is modernized.

- **Physical and Cybersecurity Threats:** An increasingly modernized grid creates a larger physical and digital footprint, which in turn elevates exposure to physical and cybersecurity threats. On a national scale, there are an increasing number of reports of both physical and cybersecurity attacks against utilities from domestic terrorists. Lastly, while the recent acceleration of artificial intelligence provides prospective benefits, it also likely adds another dimension for use by bad actors.
  
- **Changing Customer Expectations:** Customer preferences are changing at a faster rate than they have in the past due to the prevalence of social media and more granular segmentation data. Additionally, customers continue to be impacted by the inflationary pressures introduced during the pandemic, which can increase energy bill burden, especially for certain communities. Lastly, as technological advances continue to accelerate, organizations are under more and more pressure to meet customers’ evolving needs.

Staff reviews available enterprise risk-related information, including global risk trends such as those above, and incorporates new risk issues and/or expands existing risk issues where appropriate.

**D. Looking forward**

In 2025, ERM will work with leaders to refresh the enterprise risk management framework. The refreshed framework will include improvements in standardization, prioritization, aggregation and interconnectedness of risks as recommended by KPMG. Included in the refreshed framework will also be a discussion of emerging risks impacting the organization.

**4. Challenges**

Today’s risk environment is increasingly becoming more complex, interconnected and crisis-driven. How we manage risk will need to evolve in response. As we refresh the enterprise risk management framework, we will be challenged to look holistically across the organization to identify and mitigate risk cross-functionally. Moving to an approach that identifies and manages risk both from a top-down and bottom-up perspective will improve risk governance across the enterprise, our ability to identify and manage emerging risks, and provide management with improved quantitative tools to make resource decisions.

**5. Recommendation**

It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management.

|---------------|------|----------------------|------------|--------|--------------------------|
| External | Severe weather (incl wind, heat, lightning, capacity) | ⚪ ⚪ ⚪ | ➔ | ⚪ | Climate change increases the frequency, intensity, and impacts of extreme weather events. These impacts have a high potential to impact SMUD’s goals and operations. SMUD has conducted lessons learned after events and used those lessons to make process changes and plan for future events. Staff continues to conduct tabletop exercises for a number of hazard events such as storms, wildfires, heat waves, and gas pipeline to name a few. Doing so helps SMUD proactively identify gaps and address them, preparing SMUD for future events. |
| Operational: People | Strategic workforce planning: critical positions | ⚪ ⚪ ⚪ | ➔ | 🟢 | Staff conduct a bi-annual enterprise-wide role analysis to anticipate and mitigate risks of near-term and future workforce gaps. SMUD’s Organizational Effectiveness team facilitates the strategic workforce planning program, enabling senior leaders and team members to analyze workforce data and consider several criteria to identify key roles, including impact on strategy, turnover, cost of turnover, level of effort to backfill, operational impact, customer service impact, and performance variability. <br> In Q2 2024 we identified 7% of SMUD roles, or 57 total, as key roles and documented the rationale for selection as key. In Q3 we developed action plans to address workforce gaps in key roles. <br> Action plans encompass 79 different solutions to mitigate current and future risks associated with the key roles. Action plans range in complexity – some are relatively simple where a role has a single incumbent and requires knowledge transfer and cross training. Action plans can be much more complex. For example, in 2023 SMUD launched a robust Field Leader Program to address challenges in the transition from field to office. Action plans may identify the need for a new role. For example, in Energy Trading and Contracts, we’re developing a new Market Performance Analytics role to help address the increased volatility of commodities markets. |

| Operational: Process   | Supply chain | 2022  | 2023  | 2024  |            | While senior leadership drives the action plans, completing them involves support from Compensation & Classification, Talent Management, Labor Relations, Career Development & Learning and Regional Workforce Development teams. The Organizational Effectiveness team monitors progress and reports on the status of action plans quarterly. Due to the action plans being strategic and long-range in nature, staff will continue to facilitate progress and tracking through 2025. Also in 2025, staff will ask senior leaders to identify significant changes that requires reassessing key roles. The supply chain risk management program matured in 2024. Staff held regular recurring business review and demand planning meetings across several operational areas primarily focused on construction, material, and equipment contractors, including line transmission and distribution, substations, material planning, fleet, power generation, and facilities. These meetings were expanded to include additional areas with professional service and technology contractors during 2024. Staff established bulk purchasing agreements, new business service levels and replacement stock to reduce costs and lead procurement times. While efforts to mitigate this risk have improved operations, the risk trend is still increasing due to the considerable demand on transformers nationally and the amount needed by SMUD to meet regional growth and maintain a safety inventory. In 2024 and beyond, an opportunity area to focus on is third party risk management, in particular spending time managing performance and critical third-party relationships across all categories. Staff has developed updated solicitation and contract information including updated performance scorecards and procedures to support this effort. Supply chain staff recommends involving senior leadership in this process for the top services measured by spend and criticality annually. |

We continually improve our assessment approach as new data, forecasts, and technology change. This assessment process helps us plan for expected growth in a manageable way, to reduce the risk of us delaying connection of new electric loads. In addition, the assessment enables us to have a clear picture of the potential impacts in an unmanaged and a managed world. Mitigations implemented in 2024 include: <br> • "Call SMUD First" campaign which is driving conversations earlier between SMUD and the customer to help support infrastructure planning. <br> • Geospatial map where we have clusters of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption aligned with overloaded transformers to help prioritize where infrastructure upgrades may need to be made. <br> • Work with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) through their EVs2Scale2030 initiative to utilize their tools and help support more standardization of processes across utilities. <br> • Panel and grid innovation opportunities to support more electrification while optimizing grid and customer infrastructure investments. |
