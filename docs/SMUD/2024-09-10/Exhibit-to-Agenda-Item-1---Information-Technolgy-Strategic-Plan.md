# Why Zero Trust at SMUD

- **Decisive way to Improve Cybersecurity Operations and Reduce Cyber Risk**
  - Data-centric security model
  - Concept of least-privileged access to be applied for every access decision
    - Who, What, When, Where, and How are critical for appropriately allowing or denying access to SMUD’s resources
  - Risk mitigation: closing security gaps & minimize cyber risk of attacker lateral movement

- **Productivity Everywhere**
  - Empower SMUD’s Users to work securely anywhere and anytime, on any device

- **Cloud Migration**
  - Enable digital transformation with intelligent security for today’s complex environment

![SMUD's Cybersecurity Zero Trust Model](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=SMUD's+Cybersecurity+Zero+Trust+Model)

**People**  
Our employees are a key part of SMUD's Cybersecurity defense. Therefore, we prioritize awareness and training, continuous authentication, and the concept of "least privilege" where access is limited to the role and need.

**Devices**  
SMUD devices are constantly authenticated before granting real-time access.

**Network and environment**  
We deploy network micro-segmentation that aligns with access requirements and provides precise information about access to our network.

**Applications**  
Access to our applications is dynamic, requiring authentication to happen at a global level and on a continuous basis.

**Data**  
Our most significant collective effort is to improve categorization and organization of SMUD data to support authentication and dynamic access.

# Zero Trust Principles

- **Verify explicitly**
  - Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, service or workload, data classification, and anomalies.

- **User least-privilege access**
  - Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough access, risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection to help secure both data and productivity.

- **Assume breach (compromise)**
  - Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.

# Zero Trust Architecture

- **User**  
  Continually authenticate, access, and monitor user activity patterns to govern users’ access and privileges while protecting and securing all interactions.

- **Devices**  
  Understanding the health and status of devices informs risk decisions. Real-time inspection, assessment, and patching informs every access request.

- **Applications & Workloads**  
  Secure everything from applications to hypervisors, to include the protection of containers and virtual machines.

- **Data**  
  Data transparency and visibility enabled and secured by enterprise infrastructure, applications, standards, robust end-to-end encryption, and data tagging.

- **Network & Environment**  
  Segment, isolate, and control (physically and logically) the network environment with granular policy and access controls.

- **Visibility & Analytics**  
  Analyze events, activities, and behaviors to derive context and apply AI/ML to achieve a highly personalized model that improves detection and reaction time in making real-time access decisions.

- **Automation & Orchestration**  
  Automated security response based on defined processes and security policies enabled by AI, e.g., blocking actions or forcing remediation based on intelligent decisions.

- **User:** Verify and secure identities with strong authentication for access to all resources.
- **Device:** Visibility into devices accessing the network. Ensure compliance and health status before granting access.
- **Application:** Discover unauthorized applications, harden configurations, ensure appropriate in-app permissions, gate access based on real-time analytics, and monitor and control user actions.
- **Data:** Move from perimeter-based data protection to data-driven protection. Use intelligence to classify and label data. Encrypt and restrict access based on organizational policies.
- **Network and Environment:** Ensure that devices and users aren’t trusted just because they’re on an internal network. Encrypt all internal communications, limit access by policy, and employ micro-segmentation and real-time threat detection.
- **Automation and Orchestration:** Use telemetry to detect attacks and anomalies, automatically block and flag risky behavior, and employ least-privilege access principles.
- **Visibility and Analytics:** Analyze events, activities, and behaviors to derive context and apply Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to improve detection and support real-time decision making.

- **Major, generational replacement for the core SAP Enterprise Resource Planning Central Component (ECC) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems we currently use.**
  
- **At its most basic, looks and runs similar to our current core SAP ECC system.**
  
- **Underlying databases are improved, faster, and more flexible for interfaces with other modern applications.**
  
- **S/4HANA brings SMUD in line with newest SAP innovations and functionalities.**
  
- **Improved user experience, and flexibility to use more modern interfaces including SAP Fiori.**

![Why are we looking to S/4HANA upgrade?](https://www.sap.com/products/s4hana.html)

- **SAP has stopped developing new functionalities and products in SAP ECC and SAP CRM platform since Enhancement Package version 8 (2016).**
  
- **S/4HANA will help us to optimize, modernize the way we perform work.**
  
- **SAP S/4HANA has already proven out with comparable utilities such as Nebraska Public Power District and Northwestern Energy.**
  
- **SMUD already has considerable employee expertise and familiarity with SAP technologies and functional processes.**
  
- **SAP has announced the end of life and exit the mainstream support in 2027. Extended support with 2% maintenance cost increase until 2030. They will stop providing technical support for two core systems we use at SMUD today -- SAP ECC and SAP CRM.**

# Outbound Communications Technology Strategy

- Transition existing outbound communications to new consolidated platform leveraging SEW.
  - Alerts examples: outage, mid-bill, and bill threshold.
  - This will sunset SMUD's current technology solutions.
  - It will consolidate outbound communications, providing a 360 view of digital communications and leading to less integrations to manage.

- Provide more email, text and voice alerts and notifications to SMUD customers.
  - A new notifications platform will provide an opportunity for SMUD to expand its alerts and notifications offerings.
  - Offer more text communications.
  - Text examples: confirmations for your start service and move requests or your automatic payment was processed.

- Offer alerts sign-up via digital self-service: commercial web as well as residential web and mobile app users.
  - Customers can set preferences for communications via email, text and voice options.
