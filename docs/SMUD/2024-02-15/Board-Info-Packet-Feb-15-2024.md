1) Martin Luther King Jr. Day. I would like to start by wishing everyone a belated Happy New Year. We are thankful the start to 2024 without the storms and wind that we had last year. We were pleased to start the year with some important community events. I would like to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. Day March. The SMUD contingent was proud to participate there and also MLK Night presented by SMUD at a recent Sacramento Kings game. Thank you to our Board members, executive team members and staff who joined us for these important events to honor Dr. King and his lasting legacy that
<!-- Page 40 -->
2) **Board President.** With tonight’s commendation, I know we would all like to thank our outgoing president, Heidi Sanborn. Your work for SMUD over this past year has been inspiring, and I would just like to note that there were so many achievements we could not fit them all on the commendation resolution. We would also like to extend a warm welcome to this year’s President Herber and Vice President Fishman. We are thankful for your leadership this year as we continue to work toward our goal and bring the community along with us in our Clean Energy Vision at every step of the way.

3) **New Chief Financial Officer.** On the topic of leadership, SMUD officially has a new Chief Financial Officer (CFO). I would like to note that Paul, who is still not feeling well, would have liked to have been here both for the commendation resolution and also to make this announcement. Effective Saturday, January 27, 2024, Chief Strategy Officer Scott Martin will become SMUD’s new Chief Financial Officer following the retirement of our current Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Davidson. For the past two and a half years, Scott has served as our Chief Strategy Officer, and he has 22 years of leadership experience in the utility industry with a master’s degree in economics. Before becoming Chief Strategy Officer, Scott was the Director of Resource Planning, Pricing and Energy Risk Management. He spent many years working within the CFO executive area and oversaw our rates efforts. Please join me in congratulating Scott!

4) **Grants.** You have heard our CEO Paul Lau talk about recent successes in securing grants, and I have some more good news on that front. SMUD was recently awarded a $5 million dollar
<!-- Page 41 -->
grant from the California Energy Commission’s REACH 2 Program for Multi-Family Housing. Our successful proposal was in partnership with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD), receiving the maximum grant available through the funding program. The grant will support accelerating the deployment of Electric Vehicle charging equipment in disadvantaged communities to support our transition to a clean energy future.

**FROM (IPR)**  
Tom Moore  
**DEPARTMENT**  
Zero Carbon Energy Solutions  

**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:** Approval and adoption of a staff-prepared 2024-2028 Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP).  
**Summary:** Staff conducted an enterprise-wide process to prepare an updated Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) for SMUD. The HMP is a five-year pre-disaster risk mitigation plan covering all areas where SMUD owns or operates electric infrastructure. SMUD adopted its 2018 HMP by Board Resolution No. 19-06-06. The 2018 HMP will expire in June 2024. The HMP allows SMUD to qualify for California Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants financing risk mitigation projects.

The U.S. Congress passed the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) emphasizing the need for pre-disaster mitigation of potential hazards since hazard mitigation is most effective when a long-term plan is developed before a disaster occurs. DMA 2000 made hazard mitigation grants available to state and local governments. An HMP is required as a condition of future funding for mitigation projects under multiple FEMA pre- and post-disaster mitigation grant programs.

DMA 2000 outlines a process that cities, counties, and special districts may follow to develop an HMP. Staff followed this outline to prepare the 2024-2028 HMP, which includes an assessment of the most significant hazards SMUD plans for including, but not limited to, flood, dam failure, wildfire, earthquake, drought, climate change, severe weather, cyber threats, and terrorism. The public and stakeholders were invited to participate in the HMP preparation process and to provide input on the draft 2024-2028 HMP during the period December 1, 2023, through January 2, 2024.

The draft 2024-2028 HMP, once approved and adopted by the Board, will be submitted to CalOES and FEMA for their review and approval. Changes that CalOES and FEMA may require during their review phase will be incorporated into the approved HMP; if significant revisions are required, staff will present the revised HMP to the Board.

**Board Policy:**  
**(Number & Title)**  
Strategic Direction SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management  

**Benefits:**  
Adoption of the HMP will increase SMUD’s access to FEMA grants to help fund hazard mitigation efforts; and supports SMUD’s commitment to reduce and eliminate, where possible, the potential risks and impacts of natural and human-caused hazards to SMUD’s communities, systems and/or operations.

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
SMUD received a grant from FEMA to draft the plan; SMUD’s cost share is 10%. These amounts were included in the 2023 Budget.

**Alternatives:**  
1) Do not adopt the plan and forgo FEMA pre-mitigation grant funding opportunities, default on grant obligations. 2) Direct staff to update draft.

**Affected Parties:**  
SMUD Board of Directors and organization.

**Coordination:**  
All Executives and Business Unit Leadership and Teams across SMUD.

![Executive Summary](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Executive+Summary)

**Executive Summary**  
Natural and human-caused hazards have potential immediate and long-lasting impacts on the lives of people and their communities, financially, economically, and psychologically. Such hazards have the potential to disrupt entire communities. Nationwide, taxpayers pay billions of dollars annually to help communities, organizations, businesses, and individuals recover from disasters. This Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) represents the Sacramento Municipal Utility District’s (SMUD’s) commitment to reduce and eliminate, where possible, the potential risks and impacts of natural and human-created hazards. The HMP serves to help protect SMUD’s assets, customers, and communities by improving disaster preparedness and increasing resiliency. It also serves as a guide for SMUD decisionmakers as they commit resources to reducing the effects of potential hazards on SMUD’s energy infrastructure and workforce.

SMUD’s HMP is a single-jurisdiction plan that geographically covers all areas where SMUD owns, partially owns, or operates critical infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as the Plan Area).

The HMP represents SMUD’s commitment to reduce and eliminate, where possible, the risks and impacts of natural and human-caused hazards. The HMP serves to help protect SMUD’s assets, customers, and communities by coordinating our broad-based disaster preparedness and resiliency efforts.  
The HMP:  
1. Identifies potential hazards faced by communities where SMUD maintains assets or operations,  
2. Assesses the vulnerability of those assets and operations to such hazards, and  
3. Identifies specific actions that can be taken to reduce the risk from identified hazards.  

**Plan Update**  
This plan is a comprehensive update of the 2019 SMUD Hazard Mitigation Plan approved by FEMA on July 11, 2019, and is set to expire July 11, 2024.

SMUD’s 2024-2028 HMP update meets federal requirements for updating hazard mitigation plans on a five-year cycle. It represents the third iteration of SMUD’s hazard mitigation plan, which was initially part of El Dorado County’s HMP. The scope of this HMP update covers 22 counties where SMUD owns, partially owns, or operates critical infrastructure. These counties include areas of Sacramento, El Dorado, Placer, Solano, Colusa, Yolo, Sutter, Alameda, Contra Costa, Glenn, Kings, Kern, Fresno, Merced, Modoc, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, San Bernardino, San Benito, Shasta, Siskiyou, Stanislaus, and Tehama counties.

<!-- Page 75 -->
![Plan Update Approach](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Plan+Update+Approach)

**Plan Update Approach**  
A governance structure was developed to coordinate the update of the HMP. It included Executive oversight, a director level steering committee, a planning committee, and core team, each with its own roles and responsibilities. The communications team implemented a multi-media public involvement strategy based on past experience, utilizing a number of outreach capabilities including posting public notices in local newspapers, community outreach events, sharing information with public agency partners, local non-profits and supporting agencies, as well as via email.

A draft of this plan was posted on smud.org for public comments in advance of the **(date) SMUD (name) Committee Meeting** and will be considered for approval by the SMUD Board of Directors within eight weeks of receipt of pre-approval from California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

# 1.0 Introduction

## 1.1 Background

FEMA defines “hazard” as “any event or physical condition that has the potential to cause fatalities, injuries, property damage, infrastructure damage, agricultural losses, damage to the environment, interruption of business, or other types of harm or loss.” Additionally, hazard mitigation is “any sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate the long-term risk to human life and property from a hazard event” (44 CFR §201.2). The purpose of hazard mitigation is to reduce potential losses from future disasters. Hazard mitigation planning is essential in helping to reduce or alleviate the loss of life, personal injury, and property damage that can result from a disaster. A hazard mitigation plan forms the foundation of a community's long-term strategy to reduce disaster losses and break the cycle of disaster damage, reconstruction, and repetitive damage. The “purpose of mitigation planning is for state, local and Indian tribal governments to identify the natural hazards that impact them, to identify actions and activities to reduce any losses from those hazards, and to establish a coordinated process to implement the plan, taking advantage of a wide range of resources” (44 CFR § 201.1(b)).

The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) is federal legislation that establishes a pre-disaster hazard mitigation program and new requirements for the national post-disaster Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). DMA 2000 sets as a condition for receiving federal disaster grant assistance, that state and local government agencies need to have a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved hazard mitigation. DMA 2000 outlines the process that cities, counties, and special districts follow to develop a Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP).

FEMA supports local hazard mitigation planning and the achievement of the following principles:
- Plan and invest for the future;
- Collaborate and engage early; and
- Integrate community planning.

## 1.2 Mitigation Plan Update

SMUD has prepared this update to the 2019 Hazard Mitigation Plan in accordance with the requirements under DMA 2000. The HMP update was prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-390) and the implementing regulations set forth by the Interim Final Rule published in the Federal Register on February 26, 2002, (44 CFR §201.6) and finalized on October 31, 2007. The regulations established the requirements that local hazard mitigation plans must meet in order for a local jurisdiction to be eligible for funding from certain Stafford Act grant programs such as FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Assistance (PDM) Program, the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Program, the Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG), and Public Assistance (PA). This planning effort follows FEMA’s 2023 Local Mitigation Planning Policy Guide (FP 206-21-0002).

# 1.3 Purpose
This HMP represents SMUD’s commitment to reduce the potential risks and impacts of natural and human-caused hazards and serves to help protect SMUD’s, customers, and communities by improving disaster preparedness and increased resiliency. It also serves as a guide for SMUD decision-makers as they commit resources to reducing the effects of potential hazards on SMUD’s energy infrastructure and workforce. The scope of this HMP is limited to the geographic areas of Sacramento, El Dorado, Placer, Solano, Colusa, Yolo, Sutter, Alameda, Contra Costa, Glenn, Kings, Kern, Fresno, Merced, Modoc, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, San Bernardino, San Benito, Shasta, Siskiyou, Stanislaus, and Tehama counties where SMUD owns, partially owns, or operates critical infrastructure facilities. These facilities include, but are not limited to, commercial property, real estate, dams, powerhouses, transmission lines, distribution lines, roads, wind turbines, solar arrays, batteries, and gas pipelines. Each of these facilities is critical to maintaining the flow of power from generating facilities through the transmission lines into Sacramento County. The proper maintenance of these assets helps protect the communities from impacts as a result of natural and man-made hazards such as wildfires, severe storms, dam failure, blackouts, and road closures to name a few.

SMUD’s resiliency can be improved through the proper identification, analysis, planning, and evaluation of proper risk response or mitigation and monitoring of the hazards to which SMUD is most vulnerable. This HMP provides a framework to conduct such an assessment.

This SMUD 2024-2028 HMP Update (is as a single-jurisdiction plan that geographically covers all areas where SMUD directly owns and/or has an ownership and/or operational share of critical infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as the Plan Area). Several stakeholders, including public and private agencies, participated in the planning process.

Information in this plan will be used to help guide and coordinate mitigation activities for SMUD. Proactive mitigation planning will help reduce the cost of disaster response and recovery to communities and their residents by protecting critical facilities, reducing liability exposure, and minimizing overall customer and community impacts and disruptions.

# 1.4 Contents of Updated Plan
This HMP is organized into four primary parts:
- Part 1 – Planning Process and Community Profile
- Part 2 – Risk Assessment
- Part 3 – Mitigation Strategy
- Part 4 – Plan Maintenance

Each part includes elements required Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Section 201.6, Local Mitigation Plans. Compliance section requirements are cited at the beginning of subsections where appropriate to demonstrate compliance.

## 2.0 Updates to Plan

### 2.1 Previous Plans
On September 21, 2017, through SMUD Board Resolution 17-09-09, SMUD’s Board of Directors adopted the El Dorado County Local HMP Annex (Annexation Plan). The Annexation Plan focused on SMUD’s assets located in El Dorado County and addressed wildland fire, severe storms, and dam/levee failure hazards.

In June 2018, SMUD received grant funding from FEMA under Disaster Recovery (DR) number 4308 to develop its first single-jurisdiction HMP which included additionally identified hazards and a greater planning area. This plan was adopted by SMUD’s board on June 24, 2019, by Board Resolution 19-06-06. The plan was approved by FEMA on July 11, 2019 and expires July 11, 2024.

### 2.2 Update

#### 2.2.1 Grant Funding
On August 21, 2023, SMUD received grant funding from FEMA under DR-4619-469-007P to update its HMP in accordance with DMA 2000 requirements. The funding was used in the development of this 2024-2028 HMP.

#### 2.2.2 Federal Eligibility
Part 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) stipulates that a jurisdiction covered by a plan that has expired is not able to pursue federal funding for which a current hazard mitigation plan is a prerequisite. SMUD anticipates continuing to pursue FEMA grant funding for various hazard mitigations where a Plan is a prerequisite.

#### 2.2.3 Changes in Development
SMUD continually identifies and assesses changes and developments that could impact or change the levels of risks associated with hazards prone to our planning area. This helps to ensure that mitigation strategies continue to address the risks and vulnerabilities of potential development and takes into consideration possible future conditions that could impact the hazard risk profiles allowing SMUD to allocate resources more efficiently to address SMUD’s highest areas of vulnerabilities.

### 2.3 What Has Changed
SMUD’s 2024-2028 HMP includes several changes including format changes for readability and citation of requirements to demonstrate compliance with CFR Part 44. The following are some highlights of additional changes:
- Enhanced risk assessment,
- Enhanced integrated risk and enterprise business planning,
- Updated and enhanced public outreach,
- Incorporation of SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan,
- Enhance communications to address vulnerable communities,
- Identification of high hazard dams, and
- Enhanced section on climate change.

### 3.0 Planning Process  
This section describes the first step of the HMP planning process - organize resources. Organizing resources includes building the core planning team, determining the outreach plan, and documenting review.  

The planning process accomplished several critical HMP requirements, including identifying the Plan Area, defining general priorities, reviewing the capabilities of the communities within SMUD’s Plan Area, and establishing stakeholder and community outreach and input process. Strategies in developing the continuity of public participation in plan maintenance were also established, as well as means of properly documenting all future changes and updates to the HMP.  

### 3.1 Governance and Planning Team  
SMUD’s Enterprise Risk Management Office is responsible for updating the HMP, its Enterprise Risk Manager assumed the role of lead planner and leveraged SMUD’s existing risk governance structure to assist in the update of this HMP. This governance structure includes Executive oversight, senior management steering committee, a core team, and a planning committee.  

### 3.1.1 Executive Risk Oversight Committee (EROC)  
The Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee (EROC) is made up of SMUD Executives and is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer who is responsible for enterprise-wide risk oversight. During the HMP process, the EROC is responsible for the oversight, direction.

### 3.1.2 Risk Champion Network (RCN)
The Risk Champion Network (RCN) is a team of Directors who report directly to an Executive and represents various business areas across SMUD. The Core Team leverage this existing network to serve as the steering committee for this update. The RCN serves as a peer review group, providing input for the improvement of risk management practices across SMUD and drives risk informed decision making. Under the guidance of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Strategy Officer (CSO), the RCN promotes an interconnected risk management approach, assists in identifying common or overlapping risks, and encourages effective collaboration to streamline risk related activities across SMUD. During the HMP process, the RCN served as a senior leadership steering committee responsible for providing strategic direction, vetting activities being recommended to the EROC, and review of the HMP. Members of the RCN are outlined in table 3.

**3.2 Defining Planning Area**  
The Planning Team met to review the 2019 identified Plan Area and to determine changes appropriate to reflect the intent of this plan. SMUD’s Plan Area geographically covers all areas where SMUD directly owns and/or has an ownership and/or operational share of critical infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as the Plan Area). These territories are mostly located in Sacramento, El Dorado, Placer, and Solano counties. However, other areas
<!-- Page 87 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Hazard+Mitigation+Plan+2024+-+2028)

where SMUD owns, is partial owner, or operates critical infrastructure includes small portions of Alameda, Colusa, Contra Costa, Fresno, Glenn, Kern, Kings, Merced, Modoc, San Benito, San Bernardino, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, Shasta, Siskiyou, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, and Yolo counties. Current development does not impact SMUD’s plan, SMUD will continue to assess any potential impacts from future developments.

### 3.3 Stakeholder and Agency Coordination
The Plan must provide an opportunity for neighboring communities, local and regional agencies involved in hazard mitigation activities, and agencies that have the authority to regulate development as well as business, academia, and other private and non-profit interests to be involved in the planning process (44 CFR § 201.6(b)(2)).

Stakeholders (table 7) were invited to participate in the plan development via an email invitation on October 25, 2023. Throughout the year, SMUD staff works closely with local jurisdictions bodies in which infrastructure critical to SMUD’s operations exist and with regulatory bodies having authority over such infrastructure. Stakeholders received an email invitation to also participate in the review of SMUD’s HMP.

A copy of the draft HMP was posted online during a public comment period. The public was invited to review and provide their input. The public comment period was from December 1, 2023, to January 2, 2024. Additionally, the public was given opportunities to provide comment at two duly noticed public meetings, the Board (name) Committee Meeting and Board Meeting on (dates).

## 3.4 Regional Participation

SMUD regularly participates in regional and local forums to collaborate on shared interest in various risks, emergency response and mitigation planning, and information sharing. These meetings are generally open meetings that include public input. Information from these meetings was used to inform, identify, and prioritize risks in this HMP. Table 8 summarizes examples of this participation.

SMUD’s government affairs team is engaged in several efforts with regional stakeholders to discuss various hazards and climate resilience. These meetings are not public meetings. SMUD government affairs have also participated in discussions about regional climate resiliency with a group comprised of SACOG, AQMD, SacRT, SAFCA, RWA and El Dorado County Fire Council over the last year. These are not public meetings.

The SMUD Emergency Operation Center (EOC) may participate in planning exercises with other EOCs and first responders; those exercises are not a public forum.

| Organization | SMUD’s Role | Description |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) fire threat map | Member of the Peer Development Panel (PDP) | - The CPUC initiated a proceeding to develop a statewide map depicting areas of elevated and extreme fire risk in California—the "High Fire Threat District." <br> - A multistep process was used to develop the statewide CPUC High Fire Threat District, including input from investor owned and publicly owned electric utilities, communications infrastructure providers, public interest groups, and local public safety agencies, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire), and other stakeholders. The maps were available to the public for review and comment prior to approval. Primary responsibility for the development of the CPUC Fire Threat Map was delegated to PDP, a group of utility fire planning experts, and the Independent Review Team led by CalFire. |

### 3.5 Public Involvement
The public must have had an opportunity to be involved in the current planning process during the drafting stage and prior to plan approval. The plan must document what the participation entailed, including how under-resourced communities and vulnerable populations within the planning area were provided an opportunity to be involved. The plan must document how public feedback was included throughout the planning process (44 CFR § 201.6(b)(1)).

#### 3.5.1 Strategy
The Planning Team reviewed SMUD’s 2019 public involvement and identified a strategic approach to public involvement for the 2024-2028 HMP. This strategic approach was focused on:
- information sharing with the public on HMP planning and drafting process,
- having materials available at public outreach events for the general public with a focus on vulnerable communities, and
- updating SMUD’s HMP to reflect public outreach activities and participation.

#### 3.5.2 Public Notice
SMUD provided notice in local newspapers during the planning stage and the draft review stage to welcome public input regarding the HMP update. These notices were published in the Sacramento Bee and the Mountain Democrat on the following dates: October 16, 2023, and December 1, 2023.

### 3.5.4 Hazard Mitigation Plan Website and E-mail
During the development of SMUD’s 2019 HMP, SMUD staff established a dedicated webpage and email to share information on SMUD’s HMP. This webpage will continue to serve as a central location to keep the public apprised of upcoming outreach events, meeting dates and times, and the plan update process (see table 11). The webpage address is: [smud.org/HazardMitigation](http://smud.org/HazardMitigation) and the email address is: ERM@smud.org. The webpage and email were included in all public notifications, public presentations, and outreach materials.

### 3.5.5 Public Comments on Draft Plan
In addition to the listed organizations in table 7, a draft copy of the HMP was made available to the public for review. The public was given opportunity to comment on the draft HMP.
- The draft HMP was made available on SMUD's website ([smud.org](http://smud.org)) for public review from December 1, 2023, to January 2, 2024. Public comments are addressed in the final HMP.
- SMUD also provided an opportunity for public comments on the draft HMP at a regularly scheduled Finance and Audit Committee Board Meeting¹.
- There were no comments received through the public review period.

SMUD Board Committee meetings are open and accessible to the public. Meeting notices and agendas are posted, at minimum, 72 hours in advance at the SMUD office and on SMUD’s website. Those who are unable to attend the meeting in-person can livestream the meeting or view a recording on SMUD’s website.

SMUD is committed to public participation. In accordance with California open meeting laws (California Government Code Sections 54960 et. seq.) SMUD Board meetings are open to the public and the public is invited to comment at these meetings. The public will continue to be involved in future HMP updates. Prior to adoption of formal updates, SMUD will provide the opportunity for the public to comment on the updates. A public notice will be posted prior to the meeting to announce the comment period and meeting logistics.

### 3.6 Existing Documents and Programs
The plan should describe the review and incorporation of existing plans, studies, reports, and technical information (44 CFR § 201.6(b)(3)). Linking existing plans and policies to the HMP helps to identify which resources already exist that can be used to implement the action items identified in the plan.

SMUD’s plan includes a range of recommended action items that, when implemented, could reduce the Plan Area’s vulnerability to natural hazards. Many of these recommendations are consistent with the goals and objectives of SMUD’s existing plans and policies. Table 10 accounts for the plans and policies already in place in SMUD’s Plan Area that were reviewed for or incorporated as a part of the HMP planning process:

¹ The Finance and Audit Committee Board Meeting was held on (October 2, 2018) at 5:30 P.M. at 6301 S Street, Sacramento, CA 95817

**4.5 SMUD Priorities**  
Multiple risks and hazards have the potential to impact SMUD’s operations. SMUD addresses these risks and hazards as a part of its ongoing Enterprise Risk Management and Insurance Programs activities and includes them in the capital investment prioritization process. Historical data indicates that wildfire, storms, floods, and earthquakes account for the greatest losses incurred by SMUD and should be designated as priority threats. In addition, climate change has the potential to increase the impacts of these hazards as well as others.

**4.6 The Electric System**  
SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. SMUD delivers energy to its customers from a variety of sources. The sources include large hydropower, natural-gas-fired generators, renewable energy (solar, wind, small hydro, geothermal, and biomass), and power it purchases on the wholesale market. The largest single source of power for SMUD is the Cosumnes Power Plant (described below). SMUD’s UARP is its cleanest and most economical power source.

**4.6.1 The Distribution and Transmission System, Sacramento County**  
SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through 230 kilovolt (kV) and 115 kV transmissions systems. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants, and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system except for the Sacramento downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission systems. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV and 69 kV substations with overhead and underground distribution circuits.

**4.6.2 Hydroelectric System**  
SMUD’s hydroelectric system includes nine SMUD-owned and operated hydroelectric powerhouses rated at approximately 700MW in the Western Sierra Nevada Mountain region. The hydroelectric systems span approximately 50 miles with the highest elevation reservoir at Rubicon Reservoir and descends the mountain range terminating at Chili Bar Powerhouse. All total there are nine hydroelectric powerhouses with seven of them interconnected with dedicated 69kV and 230kV transmission lines. The remaining two hydroelectric powerhouses South Fork and Chili Bar are interconnected directly into PG&E’s 12kV and 21kV local distribution systems. Approximately twenty linear miles of overhead 230kV transmission lines connect the hydroelectric system to SMUD’s service area near Folsom. The hydroelectric powerhouses are fed from the various dam-formed.

4.6.6 Transmission  
The transmission system carries electricity from generation to the distribution system over long distances at high voltages. SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through a 230 kV and 115 kV transmission systems. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants, other than the Solano Wind Project, and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system except for the Sacramento downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission systems. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations.

4.6.7 Distribution  
Distribution systems move power from transmission to end use customers. The distribution assets consist of thousands of unique parts that are customary and usual for the operation of electric distribution systems. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV and 69/4 kV substations with overhead and undergrounds distribution circuits.

4.7 Gas Pipeline  
SMUD owns a transmission gas pipeline, has an equity interest in two PG&E backbone gas transmission lines, and contracts with existing interstate natural gas transmission lines to deliver natural gas to its power plants.

SMUD’s diversified portfolio of gas transmission arrangements allow for the purchase of gas from a variety of suppliers and locations, and the opportunity to capitalize on regional price differentials where possible. SMUD’s ownership interest in the SMUD/PG&E backbone and Local Pipeline enhances the reliability of SMUD’s gas supply.

4.7.1 The Gas Pipeline  
SMUD constructed and owns a 20 inch (in.), 50- mile natural gas pipeline in the greater Sacramento area (the “Local Pipeline”) that transports gas to all the Local Gas-Fired Plants except SPA McClellan (See Figure 6). The Local Pipeline is interconnected with PG&E’s major California gas transmission lines 400 and 401 at the Winters intertie. Additionally, it may be interconnected with one or more private gas gathering pipelines located in the area, and/or other FERC approved pipelines that may be built in the local area. In conjunction with the construction of the SFA Project, SMUD extended the Local Pipeline to the plant site. The 26-mile extension was completed in 2004. The extension is 24 in. in diameter and was designed to serve both the SFA Project and an additional second phase, if constructed.

![Figure 6: SMUD Local Pipeline](https://example.com/path/to/image)

4.7.2 PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 400 and 401  
In 1996, SMUD purchased an equity interest in PG&E's backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 (referred to as the PG&E backbone). The total capacity acquired is currently approximately 86,700 Dth/day. It consists of approximately 47,572 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, Oregon and 39,193 Dth/day from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD's interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California. This purchase made SMUD a co-owner of the PG&E backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401. It obligated SMUD to pay PG&E to operate the pipelines on its behalf, subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and operating protocols.

4.7.3 Gas Storage  
SMUD also employs gas storage as part of its overall fuel supply strategy. Gas storage is useful in helping to balance gas supply, mitigate market price volatility, and provide a reliable supply to meet peak day delivery requirements.

4.8 TANC California-Oregon Transmission Project  
The California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) is one part of a three-part 500 kV-line coordinated system known as the California-Oregon Intertie (COI). The COTP is allocated one-third of the 4,800 MW capability of the COI system. It can help increase awareness of business risks across an entire organization, instill confidence in strategic objectives, improve compliance with regulatory and internal mandates, and enhance operational efficiency through more consistent applications of processes and controls. The Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) is entitled to use 1,390 MW. SMUD is a member of TANC and is entitled to 378 MW of the COTP capacity. SMUD is entitled to approximately 528 MW of TANC’s transfer capability. SMUD relies on its COTP rights to purchase power and obtain renewable resources to supplement its own resources to serve its load.  

4.9 SMUD Capital Projects  
SMUD’s annual budget provides funding for capital programs necessary to meet the Board’s Strategic Directives over the year and to ensure continuity into the future.  

SMUD’s 2024 enterprise portfolio includes investments across our five strategic pillars – safety and reliability, environmental leadership, community vitality, affordability, and organizational agility. The proposed capital investment budget for 2024 is $555 million for planned investment in energy transmission, distribution, buildings, vehicles, technology, and other assets critical to meeting the energy needs of our customers and community. Proposed capital expenditures go through a rigorous evaluation and prioritization process, based on strategic alignment, risk, criticality, and financials to ensure SMUD prioritizes work that has the highest contribution to the Board’s Strategic Directions and our 2030 Zero Carbon vision.

# 6.0 Physical Setting
SMUD’s service territory is within Sacramento County; any impacts as a result of a hazard event to SMUD’s Plan Area would have the greatest impact to the Sacramento Region. As such, the assessment provided in section 6.0 will be focused on Sacramento County.

## 6.1 Geography
Sacramento County lies just north of the center of California’s Central Valley. The confluence of two of the state’s major rivers, the Sacramento and the American, lies within the County. The southwestern portion of the County extends far into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, to the point just north of Antioch, where nearly all waters of the Central Valley converge. To the south, San Joaquin County is primarily agricultural. The wooded foothills of the Sierra Nevada rise to the east in Amador and El Dorado Counties.5

In general, Sacramento County’s topography can be characterized by a broad band of very flat valley floor land in the western sector, a transition zone of gently sloping alluvial plains in the central sector, and a low foothill region in the eastern sector. Elevations range from below sea level in the delta island area in the Southwest corner of the County to approximately 800 feet in the foothill region.6

## 6.2 Climate
Sacramento County is characterized by a mild climate, with year-round sunshine. The summers are warm, with dry days and mild nights. “Rainy season” historically occurs from November through February. Mountains surround the Sacramento Valley to the west, north and east.

Torrential rain and heavy snow frequently fall on the western Sierra Nevada slopes, the southern Cascades, and to a lesser extent, the Coast Range. As a result, flood conditions occasionally occur along the Sacramento River and its tributaries.7

# 7.2 Indicators for Social Vulnerability
SMUD understands that some populations are at a greater risk from the impacts of hazard events because of physical abilities or limited resources. The vulnerable populations may vary from the general population in risk perception, living conditions, access to information and services, and capabilities to address hazard impacts.

## 7.2.1 Customer Opt-In Program
SMUD has implemented an opt-in program on smud.org that allows for vulnerable populations to enroll and receive additional information or notifications in the event of a hazard occurrence in SMUD service territory. Among SMUD’s vulnerable customers are those enrolled in the Medical Equipment Discount Rate program (MED rate), Energy Assistance Program rate, 3rd Party & Senior ID and those that have self-identified and are enrolled in the vulnerable customer program. These include customers who may rely on specialized medical equipment.

## 7.2.2 Sustainable Communities
In addition to its Opt-In Program, SMUD has a Sustainable Communities Team which oversees a community-focused program to enhance the quality of life for all SMUD customers through innovative energy solutions. The program helps bring environmental equity and economic vitality to all communities in SMUD’s service area, with special attention given to historically underserved neighborhoods.

In order to deploy comprehensive resources to the communities most in need, SMUD has developed an interactive map to help analyze current data to indicate the local areas most likely to be underserved or in distress by lack of community development, income, housing, employment opportunities, transportation, medical treatment, nutrition, education and clean environment. This map will be leveraged to support the identification of vulnerable communities during hazard events. SMUD’s interactive sustainability map can be found here: Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map (smud.org). Figure 7 shows a stationary view of SMUD’s Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map.

![Figure 7: Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map](https://usage.smud.org/SustainableCommunities/)

A number of factors were considered when developing the interactive map. The factors considered in developing the map include:

- **Opportunity Zones**  
  Opportunity zones are a new tool for community development. Established in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Opportunity Zones provide tax incentives for investment in designated census tracts. California Opportunity Zones will support new investments in environmental justice, sustainability, climate change and affordable housing.

- **Sacramento Promise Zone**  
Sacramento's designation in 2015 as a “promise zone” by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development is the catalyst for service expansion in Sacramento’s most economically distressed neighborhoods. Through the Promise Zone Initiative, the federal government works with local leaders and organizations to improve the quality of life for residents in underserved neighborhoods.  

As one of 16 urban promise zones in the nation, Sacramento’s promise zone encompasses 22 square miles from Del Paso Heights in the north to The Avenues in the south. Among the 127,000 residents within the promise zone, 34% are living in poverty, 19% are unemployed and 63% of third graders are reading below grade level.  

- **SB 535 Disadvantaged Communities**  
Areas designated as Disadvantaged Communities by state Senate Bill 535 are specifically targeted for investment of proceeds from the State’s cap-and-trade program. These investments are aimed at improving public health, quality of life and economic opportunity in California’s most burdened communities, while at the same time reducing pollution that causes climate change.  

- **Sacramento Poverty, by Zip Code**  
The US Census Bureau determines the Federal Poverty Level each year. The poverty level is based on the size of the household and the ages of family members. If a person or family’s total income before taxes is less than the poverty level, the person or family are considered in poverty. The areas shown within this data set represent those zip codes within Sacramento County where 25% of the population are considered to be below the poverty line.  

- **Medically Underserved Areas**  
Medically underserved areas or populations are areas designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) as having too few primary care providers, high infant mortality, high poverty or a high elderly population. Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) are designated by HRSA as having shortages of primary medical care, dental or mental health providers and may be geographic (a county or service area), a population (e.g., low income or Medicaid eligible) or facilities (e.g., federally qualified health center or other state or federal prisons).  

- **Healthy Sacramento Coalition – Health Equity**  
The Healthy Coalition’s goal is to reduce tobacco use, obesity, death, and disability due to chronic disease, as well as reduce health disparities, build a safe and healthy physical environment, and improve the social and emotional well-being of Sacramento County residents. The coalition conducted an assessment identifying 15 zip codes that had consistently high rates of poor health outcomes.

- **Social Vulnerability to Climate Change Impacts in California**  
  The social vulnerability index shows social vulnerability to climate change related impacts, such as natural disasters or increased heat stress. Vulnerability is defined as the susceptibility of a population to harm from exposure to a hazard and its ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from hazards.

- **Environmental Justices: CalEnviroScreen 3.0**  
  CalEnviroScreen identifies California communities by census tract that are disproportionately burdened by, and vulnerable to, multiple sources of pollution.

### 7.3 Economy

#### 7.3.1 Industry, Businesses, and Institutions  
SMUD provides electrical power to the Sacramento Region powering the state capital, technology industries, critical infrastructure, support services, businesses, agriculture, and other critical services essential to this region. An impact to SMUD’s critical infrastructure could potentially have catastrophic impacts to the operations and viability of the entire region. These potential events are discussed in the hazards sections below.

#### 7.3.2 Employment Trends and Occupations  
As of May 2023, the unemployment rate in the Sacramento region remained below 5 percent. The rate has improved compared to California, but higher as compared to US unemployment rates seen in figure 8. The health care service and the education sector experienced significant job gains with nearly 13,000 jobs in the last 12 months and the construction sector performed the worst seeing a decline of more than 3,000 jobs during the same timeframe.

8.0 Hazards  
A number of different data points were used in identifying the hazards that are most likely to impact SMUD’s Plan Area. These data points included past disasters within California, types of disasters, what identified disasters are in California’s Hazard Mitigation Plan, as well as past disaster declarations impacting the Plan Area. Additional details on these data points will be discussed below.

8.1 Disaster Declaration  
A study conducted by Moneygeek cited California as one of the most disaster-prone states with 282 disasters from 2003 to July 2023. The breakdown of the disaster count for California can be viewed in table 15. The breakdown of the declared disaster category for SMUD’s Plan Area is outlined in figure 10.

# 10.0 Risk Assessment Methodology
Hazard risk assessment is the process of measuring the potential impact to life or property, as well as economic impacts, resulting from the hazard. Its intent is to identify from available data, the vulnerabilities of a community. The results provide a foundation on which to develop and prioritize mitigation actions to reduce damage from hazards by improving preparedness and response times and allocating resources to areas with the greatest vulnerability.

## 10.1 Risk Assessment Tools
### 10.1.1 Results and Methodology
SMUD maintains an ERM program which provides a framework and repeatable and consistent methodologies to identify, assess, manage, plan, and respond to risks and hazards to which SMUD is most vulnerable. The ERM program methodology takes into consideration impacts to six different areas (financial, legal, regulatory and compliance, workforce, reputation, operations, and strategy), as well as the likelihood and velocity of the risk occurrence. Implementing this framework and methodology, SMUD has identified the hazards listed in Table 24 that will be addressed in this HMP.

### 10.1.2 Mapping
Maps were produced using geographic information system (GIS) software to show the spatial extent and location of hazards when such datasets were available. SMUD has its own internal GIS function that leverages national, state, county, and city databases as well as its own to locate available spatially based data relevant to this planning effort. The maps are included in the hazard profile chapters.

### 10.1.3 Modeling
SMUD leveraged FEMA’s GIS-based software program Hazards U.S. (Hazus) as well as past events in SMUD’s Plan Area to estimate the risk impacts in the Plan Area. Hazus is used to support risk assessments, mitigation planning, and emergency planning, and response. It provides a wide range of data to estimate potential losses from natural disasters.

## 10.2 Risk Assessment Approach
### 10.2.1 Enterprise Risk Management Framework
SMUD uses its existing ERM framework to identify and assess the various hazards and a summary of these assessments is included in table 21 below. SMUD’s ERM framework takes into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors to determine the level of inherent and residual risk of a particular hazard. An inherent risk level refers to the risk before any mitigations or controls are in place while the residual risk level refers to the risk after all mitigations and effective controls are considered.

All identified risks in the ERM portfolio are owned by an Executive and managed at the Director level. During a risk evaluation, the Director, manager, stakeholders, and subject matter experts are consulted. ERM staff gathers pertinent information to conduct the

evaluation which includes a root cause analysis. Information gathered includes key risk drivers, key risk impacts, mitigations, processes, procedures, controls, and internal/external risk trend.

SMUD’s ERM process is integrated with internal audit processes. This integrated approach works to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and controls implemented by management to reduce risks. ERM reviews the audit results to determine if the controls are effective strategies or are found to be ineffective. ERM staff will reassess any residual enterprise risk and work with the business areas to identify what else, if anything, needs to be done to further manage the risk to be within management’s objectives.

SMUD has reviewed the hazards and determined the likelihood of occurrence, extent, severity, and significance that the hazards would have on SMUD infrastructure and business operations if they occurred.

# 11.0 Fire Hazards

## 11.1 Wildfire

### 11.1.1 General Background
A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire in a natural setting that is associated with combustible vegetation, and/or fuel. FEMA defines a wildfire as an unplanned fire burning in natural or wildland areas such as forests, shrub lands, grasslands, or prairies. Wildfires are most prevalent in conditions with high temperatures, low moisture content in the air, increased fuel accumulation, and high winds.

Climate change has the potential to exacerbate conditions ripe for wildfires. Jason Funk, senior climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) says “there is very well documented scientific evidence that climate change is increasing the length of the fire season, the size of the area burned each year and the number of wildfires.” The severity of wildland fires is generally a function of a terrain’s combustible vegetation material and weather conditions. Tree stress and mortality, including damage due to insect infestations such as the bark beetle, exacerbate fire hazards.

### 11.1.2 Hazard Profile
Wildfires in the State of California have become increasingly common and destructive. Frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased, and further increase, the possibility of wildfires occurring in areas where SMUD maintains generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. The number of diseased and dead trees has increased and could further increase this possibility. As a result, SMUD faces an increased risk that it may be required to pay for wildfire related property damage or personal injuries, fines, and penalties, some of which may not be covered by insurance, or may be disputed by insurers and could be material. In addition, a significant fire, or fires in SMUD’s facilities, result in a temporary or permanent loss of energy load or otherwise materially increase SMUD’s costs or materially adversely affect SMUD’s ability to operate its Electrical System or generate revenues.

In SMUD’s Plan Area, fire season generally extends from early spring through late fall, due to the dry and hot nature of these months. If a fire occurs along an urban or rural interface, there is a high potential the fire could destroy structures, damage critical infrastructure, injure people and could result in the loss of lives.

There are a multitude of factors contributing to the increased quantity and size of wildfires plaguing the state. These factors include increased fuel loading, an increase in human-caused ignition capabilities, increased winds, climate change which is influencing drought, longer, hotter stretches of weather and increased tree mortality. Steep slopes also contribute to fire hazards by intensifying the effects of wind, making fire suppression difficult.

**Location**  
SMUD directly participated in the development of the CPUC’s Fire-Threat Map, which defines the statewide High Fire Threat District (HFTD). As a territory lead in the HFTD map development process, SMUD collaborated with utility staff, local fire, and government officials to identify areas within its service territory that may be at an elevated or extreme risk of powerline ignited wildfires. Through peer reviews and assessments by an independent team of nationwide experts led by CAL FIRE, it was determined that SMUD’s service area is appropriately situated outside the HFTD. However, some of SMUD's UARP facilities are located within both Tier 2 and Tier 3 of the HFTD, outside its service area. Despite not being regulated by the CPUC, SMUD has integrated the HFTD map into its construction, inspection, maintenance, repair, and clearance practices where applicable. SMUD believes that the HFTD map accurately identifies the level of wildfire risk within its service territory and UARP.

The CPUC Fire-Threat map identifies Tier 3, extreme fire risk, Tier 2, elevated fire risk and areas outside of the HFTD. Figure 11 depicts the CPUC Fire-Threat Map and SMUD’s service area location within the map.

![SMUD's Plan Area and Wildfire Susceptibility](https://example.com/image-url)

SMUD’s Plan Area within the HFTD has a higher susceptibility to wildfires specifically due to the Mediterranean climate which facilitates regular drought conditions as well as the natural plant communities that produce excess fuel, and the natural and anthropogenic ignition sources. SMUD’s greatest fire threat risk is in the Western Sierra Nevada Mountain range, where the hydroelectric project known as the “UARP” is located. Within the UARP, vegetation adjacent to electrical infrastructure (powerhouses, transmission lines, switchyards, etc.) is a source of fuel. Extended periods of warm temperatures as well as greater numbers of diseased and dead trees may increase the possibility of wildfires occurring in SMUD’s generation and service territories.

SMUD imports a large portion of the energy needed to serve its customers from out of its service area through the Western Area Power Authority transmission lines. These lines traverse many areas susceptible to wildfires. Actual destruction of such lines does happen, but this is not the most common threat. When a fire threatens long distance transmission lines, grid operators will derate the line. This means that less than the scheduled amount of power will be allowed to be carried by the line. This is done to reduce the amount of power which would be suddenly lost if the line were to be damaged. During heavy load periods, SMUD may not be able to obtain enough power from other sources to make up for the power lost from the derated line. Figure 12 below shows the area of the CPUC Fire Threat Map specific to SMUD’s UARP.

In addition to the UARP, open lands where SMUD’s assets lie also pose a risk related to grass fires. Grass fires can travel very fast and threaten nearby residential areas as well as critical infrastructure.

**Frequency & Severity**  
SMUD electric systems include several energized features that inherently possess the risk of wildland fire hazard, with the potential to affect other infrastructure as well as structures in the surrounding areas. Even with little change in their frequency, the wildfires that California sees on an annual basis can still pose a threat to electricity infrastructure for SMUD. Physical infrastructure in the direct path of a fire can see extensive damage, especially smaller lines, often fitted with wooden poles. Soot collecting on equipment and ionized particulate matter in the air can cause leakage currents or arcing. Firefighting measures can foul lines, requiring extensive cleanup or repair after the fire is cleared. Transmission lines are affected by high heat, smoke, and particulate matter of the fire; therefore, lines may be shut down as a safety measure.

Much of SMUD’s electricity is imported using transmission lines through wildfire-prone lands. Due to multiple climate factors, critical transmission lines will be operating near their limits in the future. Wildfire events will further strain the system and its ability to deliver reliable power to SMUD customers.

Rural communities within El Dorado County that are situated in heavily forested areas are particularly vulnerable to wildfire. Fire can also impact the general community by damaging infrastructure such as roads, telecommunication systems, and community buildings.

**Past Events**  
SMUD has never experienced a catastrophic wildfire involving its facilities. SMUD’s service area in Sacramento County has a much lower wildfire risk profile than other areas in the State that have suffered destructive wildfires in recent years. When ignition events occur, they have historically been limited in scope. This is largely due to SMUD’s more urban environment, flatter accessible terrain, low grasslands and other fuel sources outside forested areas and fewer wind events.

According to CalFire’s website, the five-year average between January – July time period is 3,067 fires and 28,875 acres burned. In 2022, the state endured 7,477 fires covering 331,360 acres. For the periods from January 1, 2023, to July 1, 2023, California endured 2,251 fires spanning 7,601 acres. This number continues to grow.

Large fires have been a part of the landscape history of the State of California, specifically, El Dorado County for centuries. Table 22 lists the most significant fires that have occurred near the Plan Area.

*Near TANC Transmission Lines

It is known from 1900, and earlier, that large fires occurred in this part of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and frequent fire return intervals (2-20 years in lower montane zone areas around Camino, Placerville, and Pollock Pines). Foothill regions of such, as where the UARP is located, burn frequently with mixed severity.

The most notable recent wildfires are the Caldor and Dixie fires in 2021, the King Fire in 2014, the Fred’s Fire in 2004, and the Cleveland Fire in 1992. Historically, areas above 5,000 feet were less likely to see a major fire (between Robbs Peak and Loon Lake), with one major fire, Bottle Hill, in 1917 near Gerle Creek Reservoir. Several large fires have periodically burned in the lower elevation canyon areas near White Rock Powerhouse, the most recent being the Chili Bar Fire in 1979.

Although the Caldor and King fires did not substantially damage hydroelectric infrastructure, they did do major damage to the forest and watersheds around the UARP.
<!-- Page 140 -->
According to the U.S. Forest Service in El Dorado County, it is unlikely for any treatments or post fire timber harvesting to be conducted in the steep canyons where much of the hydroelectric infrastructure is located. A recent study indicates that without post fire logging or surface fuel treatments, woody fuels accumulate at a rate that exceeds the decomposition rate. 

11.1.3 Secondary Impacts  
The aftermath of wildfires can see increases in debris runoff as infiltration capacity of soil is reduced in the wildfire area, especially during rain events within the two years following a significant fire. Heavy rain events following a fire may also allow water to infiltrate the loose ground soil, increasing the potential for landslides. Large swings in rainfall from season to season can encourage vegetation growth in rainy periods, leaving more fire feedstock during subsequent dry seasons and priming conditions for the spread of wildfires.

Runoff from heavy rain events also affects the production of hydropower systems that are downstream from fire prone areas, as wildfire soot and residue collect in the waterways which feed the plant. This silt and particulate matter can reduce production or even damage the turbines. As precipitation patterns change in the coming decades, the aftereffects of wildfires could increase concerns for the impact on SMUD infrastructure from runoff, vegetation growth, and landslides.

11.4 Exposure and Vulnerability  
Fire also can damage the UARP infrastructure, which includes transmission lines, powerhouses, project roads, and penstocks. Recreationalists at UARP campgrounds are particularly vulnerable if access routes are destroyed or blocked during fires. Fuel reduction treatments, including thinning, brushing, removal of forest slash and mastication along the project corridors and around powerhouses can reduce such risks. Fire also creates indirect impacts on UARP operations. Land erosion associated with denuded hillslopes, for example, can increase sedimentation of reservoirs and degrade water quality.

Recreation facilities associated with the UARP can be damaged directly by the fire, requiring lengthy periods of reconstruction. The loss of the aesthetic value of surrounding forests can also depress recreation during the long process of forest regeneration, which can have a negative effect on the economy for several years.

11.1.5 Current Mitigation Efforts  
As a condition of the FERC fifty-year license authorizing SMUD to operate the UARP, SMUD is required to file with FERC, a Fire Prevention and Response Plan (FPRP) developed in consultation with appropriate State and local fire agencies and approved by the USFS. SMUD’s FPRP filed with FERC was developed in consultation with the USFS, BLM and CalFire.

<!-- Page 141 -->
The FRPR provides in depth fire risk analysis of SMUD’s most fire vulnerable regions as well as historical data, roles and responsibilities and prevention/preparedness activities.

SMUD regularly coordinates with local fire agencies and other first response agencies. It also participates with emergency operations activities in its system areas. SMUD has robust Vegetation Management (VM) programs with accelerated and targeted VM work (pruning & removal) cycles and is using enhanced technologies including LiDAR and Ortho Imagery (these technologies can help identify diseased trees and trees that are a risk to SMUD facilities). It has also robust asset inspection and maintenance programs that include traditional aerial patrols with helicopters, IR inspections using helicopters (which can detect heat from power equipment before an event occurs) and regular ground inspections of all facilities (including core testing of the wood poles).

SMUD maintains a Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) that is reviewed and updated on an annual basis. The plan identifies the risks, SMUD’s wildfire management programs/process, and additional mitigations where necessary. In addition, it also outlines SMUD’s customer, community and stakeholder outreach and communications during de-energization events.

Table 23 depicts the activities SMUD utilizes to address specific wildfire risk factors.

**SMUD continues to meet or exceed vegetation clearance requirements and other industry standards. SMUD has also identified a series of measures for its entire electric system intended to prevent wildfires from occurring, minimize the spread of any fire that does occur, and improve the resiliency of its system. These measures include the installation of Cal-Fire approved exempt material to reduce the risk of sparking; the strengthening of equipment exposed to strong wind conditions, and the increased monitoring of, and identified responses to, fire conditions.**

**SMUD uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping of wildfire hazard areas to analyze and plan infrastructure development. It also addresses and continuously reevaluates its assets for the density and quantity of developments, emergency access, landscaping, and water supply. SMUD performs regular patrols of vegetation and obstruction around SMUD facilities in areas that are specifically designated by CalFire as hazardous. SMUD has cyclical weed clearing and tree-trimming programs for all its equipment, regardless of the area’s fire risk.**

**SMUD practices fuel management activities that are essential in establishing the desired levels of fire protection, while also minimizing the detrimental impacts of vegetation removal on the local terrain. Fuel management activities include grazing, prescribed burns, firewood collection of hazardous fuels, mechanical vegetation removal, and limited chemical vegetation control. SMUD has special approval from local agencies to remove vegetation with increased “fuel ladder” potential that exist outside SMUD’s right of way. A “fuel ladder” is any vegetation that would allow fire to climb into the tree canopy. In addition, SMUD works with property owners to identify and perform tree pruning and removal on private property. SMUD works with the property owners to ensure they understand the work needed to ensure public safety and reliability. See Figure 13 below for examples of vegetation management clearing of distribution right of ways.**

**The identified responses include operational procedures for the de-energization of lines during high fire threat conditions, and operational protocols for disabling the use of reclosing functionality on our transmission lines within the high fire threat areas and on our distribution lines during fire season in areas of high vegetation.**

In addition, it also outlines SMUD’s customer, community and stakeholder outreach and communications during de-energization events. |
| Vegetation Management Program       | SMUD maintains a vegetation management program. Trees are trimmed on one-, two-, or three-year reoccurring cycles within SMUD’s Plan Area, and 18 months for those trees identified as fast growing. SMUD also removes trees with high fuel ladder potential (vegetation that allows fire to climb up into the tree canopy). This may include the elimination of hazardous trees outside of SMUD’s right-of-way. |
| Supplier joint response coordination | Since much of SMUD’s critical assets and replacement parts are unique or made to order and the lead-time for manufacturing and delivery of these materials could take up to a year. It is important for the continued operation of the power grid to |

## 11.2 Wildland-Urban Interfaced Structural Fires
### 11.2.1 General Background
Wildland-urban interfaced structural fires refer to the fire potential of development interspersed within, or adjacent to, landscapes that support wildland fire. Urban is defined as an area with greater than one housing unit per acre.

Wildland-urban interfaced structural fires have become an increasing concern especially in the aftermath of the Maui fire where a fast-moving fire roared down the west side of the island. A combination of drought, abundant vegetation and high winds could increase the experience of urban land fires.

<!-- Page 146 -->
## 11.2.2 Hazard Profile

**Location**  
Wildland-urban interfaced fires have the greatest effect in locations where development has expanded into rural areas. Urban fires pose an increased threat to that of standard wildfires, as they can spread quickly between structures that are placed within close vicinity of one another. The community, critical infrastructure, and public safety are each affected by wildland-urban interfaced fire damages. SMUD owns, partially owns or operates infrastructure in wildland-urban interfaced areas at potential risk of impacts resulting from wildland-urban interfaced fires.

**Frequency and Severity**  
The severity of wildland-urban interfaced fires is influenced by a multitude of components, including the vegetative fuel in the area of the fire, the weather conditions, and the slope of the land. California and local agencies have adopted building codes that reduce the risk of fire embers igniting buildings. Building codes assist with reducing the frequency and severity of wildland-urban interfaced fires. However, climate change increases the risk of wildland-urban interfaced occurrence and the potential for higher rates and severity of fires increase as people move closer to fire-susceptible wildland areas.

**Past Events**  
SMUD has not experienced an impact to its infrastructure as a result of a wildland-urban interfaced fire.

## 11.2.3 Secondary Impacts  
Potential secondary effects of a wildland-urban interfaced fire include utility failure, poor air quality, and hazardous materials spill.

## 11.2.4 Exposure and Vulnerability  
A wildland-urban interfaced fire affecting a SMUD owned and operated structure could result in much more than structural damage. Communication systems, energy delivery systems, critical medical services, transportation infrastructure, and all other crucial societal functions powered by energy have potential to be damaged by urban structural fires.

The State Fire Marshal is mandated to classify lands within State Responsibility Areas into Fire Hazard Severity Zones.

The Fire Hazard Severity Zone maps are developed using a
<!-- Page 147 -->
Sacramento County is not at high risk, relative to other counties in California, of urban fire hazard (See Figure 14). However, the surrounding counties of Yolo, Solano, San Joaquin, Costa, Placer, and Sutter are all “high” ranked wildfire hazard areas. A wind event combined with a wildfire event in a bordering county would put SMUD at an increased risk for a wildland-urban interfaced fire hazard event.

Figure 14 depicts the map developed by the State Fire Marshal’s office illustrating the Fire Hazard Severity Zones for Sacramento County.

## 12.0 Water Rise Hazards

This section will cover flood and other water rise hazards collectively. These water rise hazards include:
- Flood and flash floods
- Riverine, stream and alluvial flood hazards
- Sea level rise, coastal flooding, and erosion hazards
- Tsunami and seiche hazards
- Levee failure
- Dam failure

### 12.1 Flood and Flashflood

#### 12.1.1 General Background

Flooding occurs when a body of water rises and overflows onto “normally” dry land. Floods are the most common of all weather-related natural hazards and can happen during heavy rains, when ocean waves come on shore, when snow melts quickly, or when dams and levees break. Flooding can result in significant damage to structures, landscapes, utilities, and human life.

---

88 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 151 -->
# 12.1.2 Hazard Profile

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Severe Storms Laboratory, “damaging flooding may happen with only a few inches of water, or it may cover a house to the rooftop. Floods can occur within minutes or over a long period, and may last days, weeks, or longer. Floods are the most common and widespread of all weather-related natural disasters.”

Flash floods are the most dangerous kind of floods because they combine the destructive power of a flood with incredible speed. Flash floods occur when heavy rainfall exceeds the ability of the ground to absorb it. They also occur when water fills normally dry creeks or streams or enough water accumulates for streams to overtop their banks, causing rapid rises of water in a short amount of time. They can happen within minutes of the causative rainfall, limiting the time available to warn and protect the public.

## Location

Flooding occurs in every part of the United States (U.S.) and is a catastrophe around the world. In the U.S. floods kill more people each year than tornadoes, hurricanes, or lightning.

Densely populated areas are at a higher risk for flash floods as roadways, buildings and other structures increase runoff by reducing the amount of rain absorbed by the ground.

Most of SMUD’s transmission and power generation infrastructure and equipment are located in areas that are less populated. Most of SMUD’s distribution infrastructure and equipment are located within more densely populated areas. However, SMUD does own transmission in Sacramento County in very urban areas. SMUD’s infrastructure is susceptible to both floods and flash floods.

In addition, Sacramento, where SMUD’s Headquarters Campus and East Campus Operation Center are located, is located by many rivers, lakes, levees, and dams, which have the potential of flooding.

## Frequency and Severity

According to the State of California’s Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan, flooding is widespread and the second most frequent disaster source in the State. Flooding is the most frequent and costly natural hazard in the United States, a hazard that has caused more than 10,000 deaths since 1900. Approximately 90 percent of presidentially declared disasters result from natural hazard events with flooding as a major component. The Plan Area, specifically Sacramento, has the greatest risk of flooding of any major city in the country.

**12.1.3 Exposure and Vulnerability**  
If flooding were to occur in the Plan Area, impacts could include loss of life, reduction of grid reliability, damage to infrastructure and increased safety risks. Within 6 hours of heavy rain, area rivers and tributaries become swollen and can even begin to overspill their banks in a few places, especially in historically vulnerable locations: small streams, creeks, canals, and drainage ditches tend to overflow. Normally dry gullies or dry creek-beds become alive. In flatter terrain, expanded areas of inundation occur around low-lying spots covering several secondary roads. In urban places, expanded areas of inundation occur at several underpasses or poor drainage spots, with some streets and parking lots taking on moving water. Storm drains and retention ponds overflow. In mountain areas, considerable run-off moving fast down the valley washes out some roads, especially in river valleys. Hillsides vulnerable to erosion become a concern for mudslides. Overall, flash flooding impacts buildings and roads with several evacuations necessary; damage is moderate.

![Flooding, erosion, and debris flows commonly occur in California during periods following large, hot fires. Wildfires greatly reduce the amount of vegetation and affect the soils, which in turn reduces the capabilities for the terrain to absorb rainwater. This effect allows for excessive water runoff that will often carry large amounts of debris. Structures located near a major burn area are most susceptible to flooding. SMUD’s Plan Area has experienced flooding periodically during and following major storms. This is a natural incident, given that the City of Sacramento is located at the confluence of two major rivers. It was commonly believed prior to 1986 that the levees containing the Sacramento River and the American River were of sufficient height and stability to protect the City of Sacramento from 100-year or greater storms. However, the storms that occurred in February 1986 demonstrated that those levees are not sufficient. Not only was the City of Sacramento at risk from the water flowing through the Sacramento and American Rivers, but also from the tributaries and streams that flow into those rivers, particularly Natomas East Main Drainage Canal, Arcade, and Magpie Creeks in the north and Morrison Creek stream group in the south that eventually flows into Beach Lake and returns to the Cosumnes watershed. As a result, the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (SAFCA) was formed to work with State and Federal authorities to identify and construct levee improvements and other facilities to provide 200-year level of protection for the City of Sacramento on the American River system. This work is still ongoing. SMUD will likely encounter direct and indirect impacts from sea level rise and flooding in the next several decades. While sea level rise and flooding are each a concern of climate change, the impacts compound in the Sacramento region due to the interconnected nature of snowmelt from the Sierras and ocean access from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta). SAFCA suggests that Sacramento has the greatest risk of flooding when compared to all other cities in the United States. Future Trends in Development Sea level along California’s coast has risen approximately 7 in. in the last century, and this rate is expected to accelerate south of Cape Mendocino 5 – 24 inches (5 in – 2 ft.) by 2050 and 17 – 66 inches (1.4 - 5.5 ft.) by 2100 relative to a 2000 baseline dependent on specific carbon emissions scenarios. Project predicts that roughly $8-$10 billions of existing property in California could be flooded by 2050 with an additional $6-$10 billion susceptible to flooding at high tides.**
<!-- Page 154 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://example.com/image.jpg)

Combined with Sacramento’s particular vulnerability to flooding, sea level rise could have major implications to assets and infrastructure on which SMUD depends.

## 12.2 Riverine, Stream and Alluvial Flood Hazards
According to Sacramento County, numerous parcels and roads throughout the County not included in FEMA-100 and 500-year floodplains are subject to flooding in heavy rains. In addition to flooding, damage to these areas during heavy storms includes pavement deterioration, washouts, mudslides, debris areas, and downed trees. SMUD’s Plan Area is vulnerable to flood (riverine, stream and alluvial), sea-level rise, erosion, tsunami, landslides, severe thunderstorms, and tree mortality. There are many vulnerable public and private assets, crops, vulnerable communities (elderly, children, disabled, etc.), SMUD power assets, water facilities, etc. within SMUD’s Plan Area. If any of the above events were to occur, it could adversely impact first response services provided.

Riverine flooding happens when a watercourse exceeds its “bank-full” capacity. The event is generally a result of prolonged rainfall, or a combination of rainfall and snowmelt. In SMUD’s Plan Area, riverine flooding will occur most often between the months of November and April. The intense storms that happen during these months can overwhelm local waterways and compromise the integrity of flood control structures.

## 12.3 Sea Level Rise, Coastal Flooding and Erosion Hazards
Coastal erosion is a natural geomorphic process. Coastal erosion is accelerated by factors such as winter storms, tidal action, wind-generated high surf, wave action, and rising sea levels. Periods of heavy rain have resulted in the highest sea level readings along California’s coast. Climate change plays a significant role in rising sea levels and may increase the frequency of severe weather and winter storms.

Sea level rising has a significant impact on the environment. If coastal habitats are unable to migrate inland due to rising sea levels, they may become inundated by salt-water intrusion. This will result in land subsidence, a loss of habitat for fish and wildlife, and loss of aesthetic, recreational, and commercial uses.

SMUD has not been impacted by any instances of sea level rise, coastal flooding, or erosion hazards. It is anticipated that with climate change, SMUD could potentially be impacted by this in the future.

## 12.4 Tsunami and Seiche Hazards
A tsunami is a wave triggered by any form of land displacement along the edge or bottom of an ocean or lake. Tsunamis are rare and can quickly put the lives of coastal residents, business, and visitors in jeopardy. California is vulnerable to local and distant tsunamis, but tsunamis are typically more disastrous and threatening because they afford at-risk populations only a few minutes to reach safety.

A seiche is a standing wave in an enclosed or partially enclosed body of water. Seiches have been observed on lakes, reservoirs, bays, harbors and at sea. Seiches could cause damage to

**12.5 Levee Failure**  
A levee failure or breach is classified where a levee partially or completely releases the previously contained water to flood the land behind the levee. The two main reasons for levee breaches are erosion and overtopping. Erosion can be caused by natural elements such as the wind and water, which can create new or worsen existing damage of the levee. A majority of the urban center of Sacramento is dependent on the presence of levees (See Figure 17). A levee failure would be detrimental to SMUD’s Plan Area.

Folsom Dam provides primary flood management for much of Sacramento County. The dam is operated in concert with other major dams on the Yuba, Bear, Feather, and smaller rivers to protect various areas from flooding. Levees protecting Sacramento could fail if water were released from Folsom Dam or other dams which could cause the American River or Sacramento River to rise above the top of the levees. The release capacity of Folsom Dam substantially exceeds the capacity of American River levees, and Sacramento could be flooded to protect the safety of Folsom Dam or other areas. This flood operation decision is the responsibility of the US Army Corps of Engineers.

A major flooding of downtown Sacramento would present great challenges for SMUD. Much of the California government would be without electrical power for many weeks, potentially even longer (months) due to supply chain impacts, first while floodwaters receded and then later while repairing the damage to the underground distribution system and other area assets. Many thousands of downtown employees would not be able to work and would suffer economic hardship. SMUD revenues would be impacted since key business and government customers would be unable to purchase electricity. Damage to highways such as Interstate-5, Interstate-80, State Route 99, US 50, and railroads could prevent shipment of necessary replacement parts like switchgear and transformers as well as preventing telecom companies from repairing their facilities to enable telecommuting.

<!-- Page 156 -->
![Figure 17: 2021 Sacramento County Flood Protection Zones](https://example.com/image-url)

Approximately 150 years ago, the levees of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta were raised to prevent flooding on some of the most fertile farmland in the nation. Levee failure is a high risk to SMUD due to SMUD’s Plan Area being surrounded by a network of 518 miles of levees.

94 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 157 -->
Areas subject to flooding because of a levee breach in SMUD’s service area are adjacent to the Sacramento, Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and American Rivers. In addition, various sloughs, creeks, and other drainage vehicles are subject to flooding. Other areas that flood periodically are low lying. The Sutter and Yolo bypasses afford an appreciable level of flood protection from Sacramento River overflows during the winter and spring months, leaving the American and Cosumnes River as the major slow-rise flood threat. Water from the Sacramento River overflows into these bypasses over the Tisdale, Fremont, and Sacramento Weirs.

The potential of a major, catastrophic levee failure on a major watercourse is like that of a levee overtopping on a secondary stream. The State/Federal River Forecast Center in Sacramento monitors the Sacramento, Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and American Rivers through a series of stations located along the rivers. The system affords a degree of advance flood warning for emergency responders.

## 12.6 Dam Failure
Since the 1850's, hundreds of dams and reservoirs have been built in California. They have been built to provide water for populations and agriculture, to allow for flood control, as a source of hydroelectric power, and for recreation. The storage capacity of these reservoirs ranges from a few hundred acre-feet to 5,000,000 ac-ft. The water from these reservoirs eventually makes its way to the Pacific Ocean through several river systems.

Dam failure is defined as any uncontrolled release of water, and it does not need to be a complete and catastrophic failure of a dam. Depending on the nature of the failure, it can result in a small release of water, or it can lead to catastrophic flooding. Dam failure can be the result of a variety of natural or human-induced factors such as structural failure of the materials constituting the dam and/or spillways, dam overtopping due to flood conditions, earthquakes, sabotage, and inadequate maintenance and monitoring. In the event of a dam failure, the energy of the water stored behind the dam can cause rapid and unexpected flooding downstream, affecting multiple communities and river landscapes, resulting in loss of life and property damage. Secondary effects include loss of water supply or power generation.

SMUD owns the following dams:

| Table 27: SMUD Owned Dams |
|----------------------------|
| Brush Creek Dam            | Loon Lake Dam          |
| Buck Island Dam            | Rancho Seco Dam       |
| Camino Dam                 | Robbs Peak Dam        |

| Gerle Dam                  | Slab Creek Dam        |
| Ice House Dam              | Union Valley Dam      |

95 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 158 -->
There are several other dams not owned by SMUD, both within and outside SMUD’s plan area, where a catastrophic dam failure would impact SMUD electrical system infrastructure and affect SMUD customers in myriad other ways.

## 12.6.1 Hazard Profile
SMUD’s Plan Area has historically been subject to periodic flooding. Much of the flood risk in SMUD’s Plan Area is a result of heavy rainfall and resulting stream and drainage canal overflows. Figure 18 below is the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) of SMUD’s Plan Area, which shows special hazard areas and risk premium zones, as delineated by FEMA. There have not been any flooding related hazards because of SMUD’s operations.

Flooding resulting from a dam failure can also result from any one or a combination of the following causes:
- Earthquake;
- Inadequate spillway capacity resulting in excess overtopping flows;
- Internal erosion caused by embankment or foundation leakage, piping or rodent activity;
- Improper design;
- Negligent operation; and/or
- Failure of upstream dams on the same waterway to name a few.

The California Department of Water Resources (CA DWR) Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Division of Dam Safety and Inspections (D2SI) have dam safety regulatory oversight of SMUD’s dams. They also assign hazard classifications to dams. Existing land use and land use controls (zoning) downstream of the dam are two factors considered in assigning hazard ratings. CA DWR DSOD uses four hazard classification categories:
- Extremely high hazard potential – expected to cause considerable loss of human life or would result in an inundation area with a population of 1,000 or more;
- High hazard potential – expected to cause loss of at least one human life;
- Significant hazard potential – no probable loss of human life but can cause economic loss, environmental damage, impacts to critical facilities, or other significant impacts;
- Low hazard potential – no probable loss of human life and low economic and environmental losses. Losses are expected to be principally limited to the owner’s property.

SMUD owns 6 dams that are designated by CA DWR DSOD as high or extremely high hazard potential dams. They are the Loon Lake, Ice House, Union Valley, Slab Creek, Chili Bar and Rancho Seco Dams. The locations of all SMUD dams can be found in figure 18 below.

<!-- Page 159 -->
![Figure 18: FEMA 100- & 500-Year Flood Plains around SMUD Service Area](https://example.com/image-url)

In addition, dam failures have the potential to cause loss of life, damage to property, and other ensuing hazards, as well as the displacement of persons residing in or near the inundation path. Damage to electric generating facilities and transmission lines could also affect life support systems in communities outside the immediate hazard areas.

**High Hazard Dam Assessment**  
A failure of one or more of SMUD’s high-hazard potential dams would impact communities downstream. Since 2014, all of SMUD’s high-hazard potential dams have had emergency action plans, EAPs. All EAPs and subsequent updates have been approved by the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services as required by Senate Bill 92.

SMUD’s EAPs were developed through collaborative meetings and consultation with local emergency response agencies: the Sacramento County Office of Emergency Services, Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department Herald Fire Protection District, Cosumnes Fire Department, El Dorado County Office of Emergency Services, El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office, Placer County Office of Emergency Services, Placer County Sheriff’s Office and CalFIRE. In addition, California DWR Division of Safety of Dams, FERC D2SI, the National Weather Service, and the California DWR Division of Flood Management were consulted.

97 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 160 -->
![Rancho Seco Inundation Map](https://example.com/path/to/image)

The EAP development process is extensive; it includes the development of technical reports and inundation maps. Figure 19 is an example shown of an inundation map of one of SMUD's high hazard dams, Rancho Seco Dam.

**Figure 19: Rancho Seco Inundation Map**

**Frequency and Severity**  
A catastrophic dam failure could exceed the capability of affected emergency response agencies. Damage control and disaster relief support would be required from other local governmental and private organizations, state and federal governments, and other utilities.

While some of SMUD’s dams are located upstream from unpopulated areas and large reservoirs, most are not. Failure of Union Valley Dam, for example, could result in widespread flooding of large parts of Sacramento and cause over 1,000 deaths. 

SMUD continues to minimize the impact of dam failure on the local community by complying with the FERC and Cal OES requirements to engage in EAP activities associated with dam failure. An EAP process is a formal procedure that identifies potential emergency conditions at a dam and results in a series of coordinated actions to be taken by a variety of parties to minimize loss of life and property damage in the event of a dam failure. SMUD’s EAPs include: 

35 SMUD, 2022, Dam Failure Analysis and Inundation Map, Union Valley Dam, available from DWR website  
98 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 161 -->
- A set of procedures SMUD follows to notify downstream emergency management agencies. The sheriff’s office with jurisdiction of the downstream area is responsible for the emergency response. They are aware of the potential for dam failure in their area. Every five years emergency response agencies participate in a dam failure response exercise led by SMUD.
- A set of inundation maps recognize high priority dams to aid emergency management agencies in identification of critical infrastructure and/or communities at risk for warning and evacuation planning.
- A detailed plan of coordination and communication between SMUD and emergency management agencies that will apply in the event of emergencies related to actual dam failure at SMUD’s dams.
- EAPs are routinely reviewed and must be approved by Cal OES, Department of Water Resources Division of Safety of Dams, and FERC Division of Dam Safety and Inspections.

**Past Events**  
None of SMUD’s dams have failed. Table 28 lists recent dam incidents in the Plan Area.

**Table 28: Failure of Spillways and Related Facilities Since 1990**

| Year | Name        | Extent of damage                                      |
|------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1995 | Folsom Dam  | Spillway gate failure. Flooding confined to American River Parkway. |
| 1997 | Folsom Dam  | Holes in floor of the conduit. No flooding occurred. |
| 2017 | Oroville Dam | Evacuation of 180,000 people. $870 MM in damages.   |

**12.7 Current Mitigation Efforts for Water Rise Hazards**  
The DWR Division of Safety of Dams assigns condition assessment ratings to California dams; all SMUD dams were assessed as satisfactory. Satisfactory is the highest rating indicating no existing or potential dam safety deficiencies are recognized. SMUD’s dam safety program continues to monitor, assess, and identify ways to mitigate any future potential impacts from a breach of our dams. For high hazard dams, additional dam performance monitoring and surveillance is performed that is required under licensed requirements.

### 13.0 Earthquakes and Geological Hazards

SMUD’s Plan Area is susceptible to liquefaction, subsidence, landslides, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. Volcanic activity is a potential predecessor/cause of earthquakes whereas subsidence, liquefaction, and landslides can be products of earthquakes. Northern California is at high risk of earthquake and other geological occurrences due to the proximity of the San Andreas Fault system and several nearby volcanoes.

The loss of electric power due to earthquake can occur from many related effects of a violent ground shake. Landslides can damage power line structures (poles/towers), substations, and switchyards. Liquefaction can cause misalignment of the power train of electric plants. Other SMUD assets vulnerable to earthquake damage include natural gas pipelines, liquid storage facilities, water supply systems, dams, communication systems, transportation systems, and disposal systems. Most of these assets rely on electric power. A disruption in the supply of electric power could have extremely detrimental impacts to SMUD and the community. Damages to gas pipelines and excessive flooding could lead to loss of life and economic impact.

100 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 163 -->
For example, a major earthquake could cause damage and possible failure of Nimbus and/or Folsom Dam. Evacuation of persons in the inundation area would be necessary. The damage and/or possible failure of either dam could severely damage SMUD’s energy system. It is not feasible to accurately forecast the severity of such an incident.

Power outages or power reductions can be expected throughout SMUD’s service area. Downed power lines are a potential hazard and could complicate emergency response efforts. Substations and other portions of the infrastructure, especially the underground equipment, may be particularly susceptible to damage. Administrative facilities may be subject to damage. In addition, transmission facilities outside the service area may be damaged and limit the import capabilities, thus limiting the total amount of energy available for distribution and other operations. Generation facilities may experience interruptions or may be taken offline due to shaking or loss of load.

The immediate physical, emotional, and social impact on the population would be varied and complex. In the hardest hit areas, there could be deaths and many injuries. Many could have their homes destroyed, others driven from their homes by the lack of water and/or power, leaking gas, flooding and so on.

### 13.1 Earthquake
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) describes an earthquake as both the sudden slip on an active fault and the resulting shaking and radiated seismic energy caused by the slip. Liquefaction can be a secondary effect of seismic activity on specific types of soil. This could result in differential settlement, dam failures, landslides, tsunamis, and loss of critical infrastructure. Human life is also at high risk during an earthquake event. Earthquakes represent the most destructive source of hazards, risk, and vulnerability, in terms of both recent state history and the probability of future destruction of greater magnitudes than previously recorded.

### 13.1.1 Hazard Profile
**Location**  
California is vulnerable to earthquakes because the state sits atop the boundary between two of the earth’s tectonic plates, the Pacific Plate, and the North American Plate. These two plates are constantly moving at a relative rate of two inches per year. The primary boundary between these two plates is the San Andreas Fault, which is more than 650 miles long and extends to depths of at least 10 miles. Many other small faults such as the Hayward and Calaveras faults branch from and join the San Andreas Fault zone. According to the most recent information provided by the California Earthquake Authority, there is greater than a 99% chance that a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake capable of causing extensive damage and loss of life will occur in California within the next 30 years. Moreover, minor earthquakes not associated with faults occur weekly.

**Frequency and Severity**  
There are several faults known to exist within or near SMUD’s Plan Area that could affect SMUD’s energy system. In the eastern part of Sacramento County, the Bear Mountain and

Melones Faults are found. They are believed to have been inactive for the past 150 million years. The Bear Mountain Fault passes beneath the west end of Folsom Lake.

No faults are currently known to exist within the City of Sacramento portion of the County. It should be noted that significant earthquakes have occurred on previously undetected faults. Although no faults exist there, Sacramento does feel residue from ground shaking because of radiated seismic energy.

The threat of earthquake damage in SMUD’s Plan Area comes from earthquakes along Northern California's major faults, which are the Green Valley, San Andreas, Calaveras, and Hayward faults. A major earthquake on any of these faults could cause shaking within the Plan Area to an intensity of V to VIII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, which means damage might be expected only in poorly built structures. Assets closer to the fault will experience stronger intensity than those further away.

SMUD’s operations depend on infrastructure which is owned and/or operated within the regions of the Delta, Sierra Nevada and Greater Sacramento areas, Greater Bay Area, and the Shasta Cascade as defined by the California Earthquake Authority.

The Plan Area has a high risk of a major earthquake (7.0 magnitude or higher) occurring within 50km in the next 30 years, approximately 77%37.

A major earthquake which impacts SMUD’s Plan Area could cause a great many casualties, extensive property damage, fires, flooding, and other types of hazards. The effects of an earthquake could be aggravated by aftershocks and by the secondary effects of fire, landslides, and dam failure. The time of day and season of the year could potentially also have a profound impact on the number of fatalities and/or injuries and the amount of damage sustained. Such an earthquake could be catastrophic in its effect on the population and could exceed the response capability of the state and local communities. Damage control and disaster relief support would be required from other local governmental and private organizations, state and federal governments, and other utilities.

Extensive research and rescue operations may be required to assist trapped or injured persons. Emergency medical care, food, and temporary shelter would be required for injured or displaced persons. Following an earthquake, mass evacuation may be essential to save lives, particularly in areas below dams. Emergency operations could be seriously hampered by the loss of communications and damage to transportation routes within, and to and from, the disaster area(s) and by the disruption of public utilities and services. Figure 20 shows the relative intensity of ground shaking potential in SMUD’s Plan Area from anticipated future earthquakes.

**13.2 Fault Rupture**  
A fault rupture occurs when one segment of the earth’s crust slides past another and a store of elastic energy is released as an earthquake. The resulting fracture is referred to as a fault. The sliding of the segments of earth on either side of the fault is referred to as the rupture. The fault rupture, aside from releasing an earthquake, can damage any structures or utility infrastructure around it, as the earth’s surface becomes displaced.

**Frequency and Severity**  
No major, active faults traverse SMUD’s Plan Area. However, there is a multitude of subsurface faults in the Delta. Additionally, active faults do exist near SMUD’s Plan Area that could have a detrimental impact on SMUD’s infrastructure if a high intensity earthquake event were to take place (see Table 31). Table 32 shows the active faults by county.

A fault rupture, causing an earthquake event, can lead to many detrimental residual hazards. Relative to the rest of the state of California, SMUD is at a low risk for the likelihood of a fault rupture and its residual effects (See Figure 22). Nonetheless, SMUD still has assets that remain vulnerable to shaking from fault ruptures among active faults in California and Nevada, as well as earthquakes not associated with fault rupture. Failure of these assets could lead to loss of both life and crucial infrastructure in SMUD’s Plan Area.

## 13.3 Liquefaction
Liquefaction is one of the potential hazards that is a secondary effect of an earthquake. Liquefaction occurs when seismic ground shaking suddenly temporarily causes saturated soil to lose strength and firmness. Material that is normally solid begins to behave as a dense liquid. The effect is similar to a structure on quicksand. If the liquefied layer is on the subsurface, structures upon it will begin to move laterally.

Liquefaction is most likely to occur in areas where the groundwater level is shallow.

### 13.3.1 Hazard Profile
**Location**  
Conditions such as liquefaction are most common in areas where alluvial soil is present. Alluvial soil is most prevalent in places where sandy sediments have been deposited by rivers, in moderate to large canyons, and areas in which wave action has deposited sediment along a beach. Bridges, wharves, piers, and underwater utility lines are most susceptible to the negative impacts of liquefaction.

In SMUD’s Plan Area, the Delta and downtown Sacramento are at the greatest risk to liquefaction. Though SMUD’s Plan Area has not endured any major earthquake events in recent history, there are at least five faults that lie near the Delta that can generate peak ground acceleration. The 1,100 miles of levees that surround the Delta may become unstable under seismic loading. The presence of sand and silt in the levees make liquefaction a very high possibility.

## 13.4 Subsidence
Subsidence is a sinking of the ground. More specifically, it is deemed as “movement in which there is no free side and surface material is displaced vertically downward with little or no horizontal component.”

### 13.4.1 Hazard Profile
**Location**  
SMUD’s Plan Area is affected by some unique types of subsidence. The types of subsidence include:
- Earthquake-induced subsidence. This type of subsidence occurs when earthquake shaking causes the compaction of unconsolidated soils.
- Subsidence due to compaction by heavy structures. The Delta levees subside, in part, because of their own weight.
- Subsidence due to wind erosion of peat soils in the Delta.
- Subsidence due to fluid withdrawal. The removal of oil and gas in the Delta has caused some slight subsidence of soils in the Delta. Water withdrawal has been a much more important problem in Sacramento County.
- Subsidence due to peat oxidation in the Delta.

107 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 170 -->
![Figure 23: Known and Potential Subsidence Areas in Sacramento County](https://example.com/image-url)

**Frequency and Severity**  
Subsidence due to peat oxidation occurs in the Delta. Farmers drain the surface of the soil to plant and plow. When the peat dries out, aerobic bacteria can feed on the peat and convert it to carbon dioxide and other gaseous substances in a process called peat oxidation. Gradually, the peat is disappearing to the bacteria.

The subsidence in the Delta has caused problems for flood control because it places increasing pressure on the levees. These levees keep the surrounding water from inundating lower areas. The increasing hydrostatic pressure caused by the subsidence weakens the levees, necessitating periodic rebuilding. In terms of economic costs, subsidence makes flood protection increasingly expensive.

<!-- Page 171 -->
![Past Events](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
**Past Events**  
SMUD anticipates that within its Plan Area, if there continues to be drier climates, which removes water from the ground, making it dry, there will be increased risk of subsidence. To date, SMUD has not been impacted by subsidence.  

There are no SMUD administrative facilities known to be in areas of existing, ongoing, or potential subsidence. Earth movement and sinking has developed at some substation sites. These conditions have been corrected.  

### 13.5 Landslides  
The Plan Area is susceptible to landslides. Landslide refers to a variety of slope instabilities that result in the downward and outward movement of slope-forming materials including rocks, soil, and artificial fill.  

#### 13.5.1 Hazard Profile  
**Location**  
Most landslides occur during rainy months when soil is saturated with water. Winter storms with intense rainfalls are the most common trigger for landslides. Masses of rock and soils can become detached from steep slopes or cliffs because of earthquakes, flooding, and/or drought and is strongly influenced by gravity, weathering, undercutting, or erosion. Rotational slides caused by the earth movements create a concaved upward movement of soil. This usually results in a bulging “toe” made of the slid material at the bottom of the slide. These types of land movement could cause significant damage to roads, leaving them unsafe to travel on.  

Landslide impacts are geographically limited to the area where the slide occurs and are primarily associated with mountainous regions. The potential for larger slides in SMUD’s Plan Area exists in the UARP and other mountainous regions. The primary factors that could cause or increase the likelihood of landslides for SMUD are:  
- Naturally occurring geological movement including rainfall, water action, seismic, and volcanic activities.  
- Excavation and grading on sloping ground for homes, roads, and other structures.  
- Drainage and groundwater alterations or breaches.  
- Change or removal of vegetation located on steep slopes.  

**Frequency and Severity**  
Landslides can occur throughout the Plan Area, though more tend to occur in areas with steeper slopes, weaker geology, and high annual precipitation. Landslides may result from several things including natural and human-caused changes in the environment such as heavy rain, rapid snow melt, steepening of slopes due to construction or erosion, earthquakes, changes in groundwater levels and deforestation caused by wildfires. There have been incidents of landslides and general slope failure in isolated portions of El Dorado County, but it is an uncommon occurrence with no defined history of significant damages.  

109 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 172 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan](https://example.com/image.jpg)

A more detailed landslide hazard assessment requires a site-specific analysis of the slope, soil, rock, vegetation, and groundwater characteristics. Such assessments are often conducted prior to major development projects in areas with moderate to high landslide potential, to evaluate the specific hazard at the development site. SMUD does not have sufficient information to determine the extent of landslides in its Plan Area. It has not been impacted by such an event.

## 13.6 Volcanoes

Volcanic eruptions are one of Earth's most dramatic and violent agents of change. Not only can powerful explosive eruptions drastically alter land and water for tens of kilometers around a volcano, but tiny liquid droplets of sulfuric acid erupted into the stratosphere can change our planet's climate temporarily.

### 13.6.1 Hazard Profile

**Frequency and Severity**  
The principal hazards to people in the Pacific Northwest are from lahars and ash fall. Lahars (volcanic mudflows) can destroy buildings and infrastructure. Eruptions that include volcanic ash can be especially dangerous for aircraft, even at long distances from the volcano because volcanic ash can clog and shut down their engines. Explosive eruptions of volcanic particles are followed by effusion of lava flows. High-speed avalanches of hot rock and gas can accompany columns of tephra collapse or the fronts of lava flows crumble, both of which can send pyroclastics flowing down the volcano's flanks. Finally, when the erupted material mixes with river water or melts snow and ice, volcanic mudflows sweep down valleys and can devastate areas more than 50 miles downstream. Rivers can continue to carry volcanic sediment downstream and force flooding for decades to hundreds of years. The most significant threats are from volcanic ash and from the slurry of mud and debris within lahars. Even in the absence of eruption, the flanks of Cascade volcanoes can collapse, which result in landslides and debris avalanches that can destroy areas downslope from the collapse location.

Volcanoes pose multiple types of hazards, and the initiation and duration of eruptions is relatively uncertain. Therefore, authorities and populations at risk, both close to and far from the volcano, must be knowledgeable about volcanic hazards so that they can be flexible and prepared in their response.

Eruptions often force people living near volcanoes to abandon their land and homes, sometimes forever. Those living farther away are likely to avoid complete destruction, but their cities and towns, crops, industrial plants, transportation systems, and electrical grids can still be damaged by tephra, ash, lahars, and flooding.

Fortunately, volcanoes exhibit precursory unrest that, when detected and analyzed in time, allows eruptions to be anticipated and communities at risk to be forewarned. The warning time preceding volcanic events typically allows sufficient time for affected communities to implement response plans and mitigation measures.

<!-- Page 174 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan](https://example.com/image.png)

Hazard response and coordination plans are multi-agency efforts that define the responsibilities and actions to take in the event of a restless or active volcano. Scientists from the five regional volcanic observatories of the USGS Volcano Hazards Program participate in developing these plans with state and local governments of at-risk areas. If volcanic unrest or an eruption occurs, scientists from the observatories will keep state and local officials informed of potential hazards so that coordination and response plans can be updated as needed.

## 13.7 Current Mitigation Efforts for Geological Hazards
SMUD’s mitigation efforts for earthquake and geological hazards events are uniform with the requirements of the State of California. A list of current mitigation activities is depicted in table 34 below.

### Table 34: Current Geological Hazards Mitigation

| Mitigation                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mapping                          | SMUD has identified all site-specific earthquake hazards and has created an identification map with operational emergency processes for the recognized seismic events that could occur, could trigger reinspction of certain assets as appropriate. |
| Adhering to codes               | SMUD follows all current building codes and makes regular structural improvements to its facilities. Critical facilities are subject to more scrutinizing and innovative regulations and mitigation measures.   |
| Vulnerability assessment         | SMUD regularly assesses its water supply, oil, and natural gas pipelines for potential failure during an earthquake event. SMUD’s high hazard potential and significant hazard potential dams in the UARP are inspected annually with FERC and DSOD. All dams were found to not fail according to the guidelines. |
| EOC                             | SMUD maintains an EOC to help coordinate real-time incident command, response, and recovery from all emergencies, including those resulting from hazards.                                                    |
| Supplier joint-response agreement | Since much of SMUD’s critical assets and replacement parts are unique or made to order and the lead-time for manufacturing and delivery of these materials could take up to a year, it is important for the continued operation of the power grid to maintain the health and safety of our community, to participate in a supplier joint response coordination. The coordination allows SMUD to borrow from participating utilities and suppliers, key assets for immediate use. |
| Gap analysis                    | SMUD actively practices identification of gaps in current response plans for earthquake events and revises them regularly.                                                                                  |
| Proper equipment                | SMUD utilizes flexible piping, flexible couplings, and above ground fault crossings.                                                                                                                       |

14.0 Severe Weather and Storms  
Severe weather is a weather event that is beyond the range of commonly observed weather patterns in a geographic area. In the SMUD Plan Area, the usual events could include extreme heat, heavy rain, hail, lightning, and strong winds. The full possibility of weather events includes rainfall events, heat waves, storms, unusually cold temperatures, and wind events. California is projected to endure an increase in severe weather events due to climate change.

Severe weather can be viewed in four phases (see table 35) to communicate and coordinate with local agencies, mobilize necessary resources, and support local agencies in recovery efforts.

**Table 35: Severe Weather Guidance**  
| Phase | Category | Suggested Criteria | Critical Criteria |
|-------|----------|--------------------|-------------------|
| I     | Seasonal readiness | On-set of summer and winter | Cooler months: Nov-Feb<br>Warmer months: Jun-Aug |
| II    | Increased readiness | Warmer or cooler than normal credible weather predictions | Potential for prolonged abnormal weather conditions and possibility of weather-related power outages. |
| III   | Severe weather alert | Credible forecasts of excessively hot or cold weather conditions: daytime temps for a duration accompanied by specific nighttime temps | Heat: excessively hot weather for three days accompanied by night temps of 75°F or more.<br>Cold: extreme cold/freezing warning or wind chill warnings indicating extreme weather conditions for three days accompanied by night temps of 32°F or less. |
| IV    | Severe weather emergency | Extreme weather conditions that could potentially have a life-threatening impact on the population, animals, and agriculture | Heat: heat index of over 105°F with credible weather forecasts of excessively hot weather for more than three days accompanied by night temps of 75°F or more.<br>Cold: extreme cold/freezing warnings or wind chill warnings indicating weather conditions that endanger human life with credible weather forecasts of extremely cold/freezing weather for more than three days accompanied by night temps of 32°F or less. |

14.1 Extreme Heat  
In the Plan Area, an extreme heat day is defined as a day between April and October in which the maximum temperature exceeds the historical 98th percentile of maximum temperatures for that given day. Cal-Adapt, a web-based climate adaptation planning tool developed by the California Energy Commission defines an extreme heat day, specific to SMUD’s plan region as one that exceeds 100°F. SMUD’s concern is the impact of extreme heat.

**Frequency and Severity**  
Extreme heat has always been a characteristic of the Sacramento region and the surrounding areas. However, extreme heat events are now projected to increase in regularity throughout the state of California because of climate change. The heat events are projected to be of a greater intensity, longer duration, and influence a broader geographic area. Average night-time temperatures, especially important for public health and infrastructure, are projected to increase even faster than daytime averages.

Extreme heat can also be accompanied by increased humidity. Extreme heat combined with increased humidity can pose a serious threat to human life and the longevity of infrastructure in SMUD’s Plan Area. A series of extreme heat days occurring consecutively is referred to as an extreme heat event. As climate change continues to affect SMUD’s Plan Area, heat events are becoming more prevalent.

The National Weather Service has implemented Impact-Based Decision Support Services (IDSS) which provides improved reporting of heat risk in the SMUD Plan Area. IDSS

Extreme heat ranks as among the deadliest of all natural hazards. Humidity and extreme heat can provoke a quantity of natural hazards such as dust storms and drought. High temperatures usually coincide with low humidity. High temperatures generally contribute to the evaporation of surface water and moisture from the soil causing the soil to become loose and easier to be carried away by wind. As temperatures increase, it may overload demands for electricity to run air conditioners in homes and businesses.

Extreme heat tends to not affect infrastructure, as heat events are generally limited in length. Infrastructure gets relief between hot and cool temperature cycles. SMUD’s biggest points of vulnerability are, given an extreme heat event, an overload demand for electricity to run air conditioners in homes and businesses and the safety of its employees in the field.

Extreme heat is harmful to the population and employees in SMUD’s Plan Area. In California, heat-related events annually send 4,300 people to the emergency room and hospitalize an additional 600 for stays longer than one day. In 2006, during one of California’s worst heatwaves, 203 deaths were attributed to heat-related events.

The populations that are most vulnerable to heat-related events include the homeless, infants and children under age five, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, individuals dependent on medical equipment, and individuals with impaired mobility.

**Past Events**  
The Plan Area temperatures could range from moderate to extremely high heat. The warmest times of the year are typically the late summer and early fall. The Plan Area has suffered occasional heat events. The sudden spike in temperature has a great impact on residents inside and outside the Plan Area and could affect the electric grid. Table 37 depicts available data found for the most recent excess heat events in the NCDC database for the Plan Area.

**14.2 Freeze**  
Extreme cold and freeze is most likely to occur during the winter months, and often accompanies a winter storm. Sustained freezes can cause life loss and health risks to vulnerable populations. Economically, freezes can severely affect agriculture in SMUD’s Plan Area, which affects farmers, farm workers, packers, and shippers of agricultural products. Freezes can also cause significant increases in food prices to the consumer due to shortages.

117 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 180 -->
The NCDC has recorded 22 freeze incidents in SMUD’s Plan Area since 1993, resulting in $200,000 in property damage and $5MM in crop damage. In 2013, a six-day freeze event caused more than $440MM in damage to citrus crops throughout the state. Freezes are likely to become less frequent in California as climate change increases average temperatures.

**Exposure and Vulnerability**  
Exposure to extreme cold and freeze may be life threatening since it can cause frostbite or hypothermia. The populations most susceptible to the dangers of freeze are infants and the elderly. Regarding infrastructure, pipes may freeze and burst in homes or businesses that have poor insulation; ice can also form on power lines which could weigh powerlines down, stressing and damaging it. In the most extreme of conditions, freezes can impair communication facilities in SMUD’s Plan Area. If freeze is intermixed with warm weather cycles, it may result in an increase in avalanche risk.

**14.3 Fog**  
Fog is formed when ice crystals and/or water droplets collect, suspended in the air at the earth’s surface. This occurs when the air is cooled to the point that it can no longer contain all the water vapor it has accumulated. In Sacramento, fog season occurs in the late fall and winter. Fog typically forms in the early morning hours, and it can and will last several days at a time.

**Table 38: Fog Events in Sacramento County**

It is currently unclear if climate change will have a future effect on fog in the Sacramento area. However, decreasing emissions in the air in response to climate change has resulted in a decline in winter fog events over recent decades. 

Fog in the Sacramento area can reduce visibility to mere feet. This can lead to multi-car accidents and have devastating effects on transportation corridors. Severe fog can close roads, cause accidents, and impair the effectiveness of emergency responders. Electric infrastructure along roadways is at risk of accident-related damage. In addition, SMUD’s employees are required to drive heavy equipment to conduct work. Increased fog increases risks for drivers and electric workers by limiting visibility. Considering that most of SMUD’s Plan Area sits within a valley, it is at risk for dense fog. There is not enough data to determine specific potential extent of fog in SMUD’s Plan Area.

### 14.4 Severe Storms, Hail and Lightning
A thunderstorm is considered severe when it either contains three-quarters of an in-sized hail or winds more than 57.5 miles per hour (mph) - this includes tornadoes. Severe storm events are most prominent during the fall, winter, and spring. Sacramento County averages 18.14 in. of rainfall per year.

Hail is created when water droplets are carried upwards, above the freezing level. The droplets freeze, becoming too heavy for the updraft to carry, and fall to the ground. Hail is usually less than two in. in diameter, but it can fall at speeds of 120 mph.

Lightning is a visible electrical discharge caused by a thunderstorm. Lightning can strike as far as five to ten miles from the storm, in areas authorities may not consider to be a direct threat.

| **Table 39: Severe Weather Events in Sacramento County Since 1950** |
|----------------|--------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **Event Type** | **Number of Events** | **Deaths** | **Injuries** | **Property Damage** | **Crop Damage** |
| Hail           | 9      | 0      | 0             | $111,030     | $0           |
| Heavy rain     | 28     | 0      | 1             | $365,000     | $50,000      |
| Lightning      | 1      | 0      | 0             | $150,000     | $0           |

### Exposure and Vulnerability
Severe storms can cause flooding as well as drainage issues in the Sacramento area. Severe storms also put many assets at risk, as flooding combined with strong winds can result in the failure of very mature trees and other geological hazards.

Hailstorms can destroy roofs, buildings, automobiles, vegetation, and SMUD assets.

Lighting can kill or injure employees and people in SMUD’s Plan Area. Assets and infrastructure can also be struck directly. These strikes could result in a burn, explosion, or destruction. Lightning can also lead to wildfire if it strikes the surface in a dry region with vegetation high in fuel.

## 14.5 High Winds and Tornadoes
The National Weather Service (NWS) defines high winds as sustained wind speeds of 40 mph or greater lasting for one hour or longer, or winds of 58 mph or greater for any duration.

High winds can lead to funnel clouds and tornadoes during severe storms. Damages from tornadoes are a result of high wind velocity and wind-blown debris accompanied by lightning or large hail. Each year, an average of 800 tornadoes occurs nationwide, resulting in an average of 80 deaths and 1,500 injuries.57

### 14.5.1 Hazard Profile
Wind speeds during a tornado can reach 300 mph. Unlike hurricanes, which can also produce such wind speeds over great geographic areas, tornadoes are confined to much smaller areas over short distances. SMUD’s Plan Area is at a low risk for tornadoes, relative to the rest of the United States. When tornadoes have occurred historically, they have done so at low intensity on the Fujita Tornado Scale58. However, if a tornado were to affect the area, it would most likely be in the late fall or early spring.

### Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD’s Plan Area is at a low risk of hazardous levels of high winds, relative to other areas of the country (see figure 27). However, high winds are a seasonal occurrence that will continue to occur annually in the Plan Area.

**Past Events**  
Fallen trees from high winds in SMUD’s Plan Area can damage buildings as well as critical structures, including electrical overhead lines, leading to secondary impacts from fire and power outage as well as serious injury to staff or the public and potential death. The most recent high wind and storm events occurred from late December 2022 to January 2023 causing fallen trees and power outages in SMUD service territory. A selection of recorded high wind events can be found in table 40 below.

High winds, particularly those accompanying severe storms, can result in significant property and crop damage. Most hazardous to SMUD’s Plan Area, high winds can exacerbate existing weather conditions and increase the speed at which wildfire travels. Through the damage of roofs and structures, or residual damage caused by fire, winds can have a serious impact on the functional operation of SMUD assets.

High winds can result in power loss and business closures. Winds can also affect fog, dust, and snowstorms. Wind events have caused greater than $14MM in damage in SMUD’s Plan Area since 1955 (see Table 41).

Tornadoes have similar damaging potential to that of high winds. A tornado is likely to damage buildings, cause trees to fall, damage power lines, break gas lines, break sewer and water mains, and cause fires. Access to hazard recovery might also become impaired due to a tornado, as roads can be destroyed or blocked by debris.

While there are incidents of tornadoes in SMUD’s Plan Area, it poses a relatively low risk for most of the area compared to states located in the Midwest and South of the nation. The Plan Area is subject to strong winds associated with powerful winter cold fronts. Strong winds because of tornadoes could have an impact on reliability, could cause increased risk of fires and cause damages to SMUD infrastructure.

**14.6 Current Mitigation Efforts**

SMUD mitigates extreme heat by protecting its outdoor workers. SMUD provides adequate water, shade, rest breaks, training, and emergency procedures to ensure the safety of its employees. Employees are constantly evaluated for signs and symptoms of heat illness, especially in temperatures greater than 95°F. SMUD also has load flexibility and demand response programs in place to address peak load during extreme heat events and the increased use of air conditioning.

SMUD mitigates freeze with warning systems and demand response programs to handle peak load during an increase in the use of electric heating systems. SMUD mitigates high wind events through wind engineering design and construction of its assets, according to state, federal, and industry standards. To prevent the fall of trees to electrical lines, SMUD’s vegetation management program seeks to proactively identify trees at risk of falling for removal. In terms of storms and fog-related accident risk, SMUD power lines are marked and inspected for visibility and integrity. SMUD employees are trained to...

To mitigate severe weather and storm events, SMUD crews assist in maintaining clear channels, canals, and creeks by removing weeds and debris that can halt water flow during severe weather incidents. SMUD holds drills to rehearse floodgate closures to ensure a rapid response during an emergency.

### 14.7 Tree Mortality
Tree mortality refers to the death of trees due to factors such as drought-induced water stress, insect attacks, and high tree density.
<!-- Page 188 -->
![14.7.1 Hazard Profile](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=14.7.1+Hazard+Profile)

**Frequency and Severity**  
Increased tree mortality elevates fuel loads, creates hazardous conditions for firefighting personnel, decreases production rates of fire line construction, poses risk of injury and damage from falling branches, and financially impacts property owners. From 2010-2022, 208.6 million trees have died in California. This frequency is expected to increase due to continued climate change. A growth in the rate of tree mortality can affect local, regional, and global carbon budgets. Table 44 below depicts the estimated number of trees that have died each year since 2010.

**Past Events**  

**Table 44: Estimated Cumulative Number of Dead Trees in California**  
| Year | Estimated Number of Dead Trees |

**14.7.2 Exposure and Vulnerability**  
Increased wildfire risk associated with tree mortality has resulted in a major reorganization of the forest’s ecosystem. SMUD’s Plan Area is expected to see a decline in forest productivity, a change in species composition, a shift to smaller sized trees, and a reduction in forest extent in some regions. There is no data to show how many trees in SMUD’s Plan Area are dead and/or dying. SMUD does not record the number of trees that it removes as a result of tree mortality. Its vegetation management program removes trees under and adjacent to transmission and distribution lines to increase safety, reliability, and decrease wildfire risks.

15.0 Energy Shortage  
15.1 Background  
15.1.1 Hazard Profile  
Delivery of electricity service in SMUD’s Plan Area has been consistently and highly reliable for most of the century-long development, expansion, and continuous operation of grids across all regions of the Nation. The traditional definition of reliability—based on the frequency, duration, and extent of power outages—may be insufficient to ensure system integrity and available electric power in the face of climate change, natural hazards, physical attacks, cyber threats, and other intentional or accidental damage; the security of the system, particularly cybersecurity, is a growing concern.

Resilience is the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions, as well as the ability to withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions, whether deliberate, accidental, or naturally occurring. Resilience incorporates a dynamic response capability to reduce the magnitude and duration of energy service disruptions under stressful conditions. Infrastructure planning and investment strategies that account for resilience typically broaden the range of risk-

15.1.2 Exposure and Vulnerability  
Changes in the climate are expected to bring more frequent and extreme weather conditions. Extreme weather conditions have the potential to decrease the efficiency of thermal power plants and substations, decrease the capacity of transmission lines, render hydropower less reliable, spur an increase in electricity demand, and put energy infrastructure at risk of flooding and fire. Similarly, during cold spells, heating demands increase, further stressing the energy infrastructure.

The Sacramento area faced historic storms from New Year’s Eve to the early weeks of January 2023, with severe rain, 70-mph winds, and lightning, leading to significant damage and unprecedented power outages. Over 599,000 customers experienced power outages during that period. Additionally, there were 300+ power poles that fell, 1,800 wires down, and 650 downed and broken trees.

15.1.3 Current Mitigation Efforts  
SMUD considers several natural hazards during the planning, construction and maintenance stages of its equipment and infrastructure. This may result in new equipment standards, environmental reviews, and risk assessments to help reduce the impacts of the natural hazards on new or existing infrastructure locations. SMUD periodically reviews and revises its projections of long-term energy demand against State requirements as a part of plan for expansion of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities.

# 16.0 Climate Change

## 16.1 Background
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) defines climate change as the change in the usual weather conditions and patterns found in a region. More specifically, it is a change in the average weather conditions such as temperature, rainfall, snow, ocean, and atmospheric circulation, or in the distribution of weather around the globe. According to NASA, scientists think that the Earth’s temperature will keep increasing for the next 100 years. “This would cause more snow and ice to melt. Oceans would rise higher. Some places would get hotter. Other places might have colder winters with more snow. Some places might get more rain. Other places might get less rain.” 

California has already been experiencing the impacts of climate change including prolonged droughts, increased coastal flooding and erosion and tree mortality. The state has also seen increased average temperatures, more extreme heat days,

### 16.1.2 Current Mitigation Efforts

**Table 47: Current Climate Change Hazards Mitigation**

| Mitigation Description |

From an operations perspective, climate change means rising energy demand and falling generation and distribution efficiency for the energy sector. Higher ambient temperatures will increase energy demand during the peak summer months by driving use of air conditioning. Rising temperatures will also decrease the efficiency of thermal conversions, meaning that more resources will be required to produce the same amount of energy. In addition to higher temperatures, climate change may bring increased frequency and severity of major weather events, which pose a threat to infrastructure. Changing weather patterns may also affect solar-, wind-, and hydropower generation.

SMUD is an industry leader in innovation and progress in California’s effort to reduce greenhouse gases and prepare for climate changes. In 2012, SMUD produced its first targeted climate readiness study and adaptation strategy. The review included a “state of the science” assessment to update scientific findings and incorporate lessons from the California Climate Adaptation Strategy, Adaptation Policy Guide, and numerous other resources. The climate readiness study and adaptation strategy are an integrated plan for addressing climate change. The analysis gives SMUD an opportunity to critically assess climate change risks and strategy and improve its readiness efforts, while providing a venue for sharing and learning best practices, providing transparency to the community, and building on local efforts with other public and private organizations. The study was updated in 2016 to include a Readiness Action Plan that addresses community engagement, enterprise programs, capital projects, and operational initiatives. In 2021, SMUD took a step further by releasing its 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. The plan details the goal of eliminating carbon emissions from power generation by 2030. SMUD has many programs supporting the equitable transformation to clean energy, including building and transportation electrification incentives, electric vehicle test drives, and partnerships to develop new technologies and strengthen the renewable energy grid.

SMUD’s forward-looking mitigation strategies include:
- Leveraging the best available climate science to make decisions, updating the “state of the science” assessment every four years.
- Continuing to collaborate with multiple local agencies on flood data analysis and preparedness planning.
- Taking proactive measures to make SMUD more resilient.
- Conducting research into the impacts of sustainable forest management techniques on wildfire risk reduction and stream flows.
- Identifying systematic opportunities to integrate climate change projections in internal program planning and capital budget development and approval.
- Investigating opportunities to employ resiliency bonds to finance further readiness measures.
- Supporting and participating in the Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative to assist public and private partners in the region improve overall climate readiness.
- Continuing implementation of the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.

**17.0 Threat and Social Disturbance Hazards**

Threat and disturbance address a symptom of and a form of protest against unfavored decisions. The severity of these actions coincides with the level of public outrage; it could range from blocking or impeding access to a building and disrupting normal activities by generating noise and intimidating people to a full-scale riot that destroys property and terrorizes individuals.

# 17.1 Terrorism

The Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives (28 C.F.R. Section 0.85). Terrorism refers to human-caused hazards and their use of weapons of mass destruction: biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological weapons, arson, incendiary, explosive and armed attacks, or any devices or vehicles that can be used to cause destruction and/or casualties. Terrorism also includes industrial sabotage, intentional hazardous materials releases, and cyber terrorism. Terrorists have a desired objective to target large public gatherings, water and food supplies, utilities and corporate centers, and communication capabilities.

The three key elements to defining a terrorist event are as follows:
- Activities involve the use of illegal force,
- Actions are intended to intimidate or coerce, and
- Actions are committed in support of political or social objectives.

## 17.1.1 Hazard Profile

The following (see Table 48) are potential methods used by terrorists that could directly or indirectly impact SMUD’s Plan Area:

### Table 48: Potential Methods of Terrorist Attacks

| Active Shooter                | Arson                       |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Explosive detonation          | Biological agent release     |
| Chemical agent release        | Cyber terrorism              |
| Kidnapping/Hostage-Taking     | Nuclear Detonation           |
| Radiological incident         | Vehicle Ramming Attack       |

**Frequency and Severity**

SMUD owns critical infrastructures as defined by the Department of Homeland Security. These critical infrastructures are more vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Since September 11, 2001, the number of threats involving the use of chemical, nuclear, or biological agents by individuals and terrorist groups wishing to instill fear and disrupt communities within the United States has escalated. However, to date, SMUD has not experienced a known high-profile attack by groups or individuals associated with international terrorist organizations. Nor has SMUD experienced an incident involving a biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear weapon. Nevertheless, domestic terrorist incidents such as the December 3, 2022, Moore County NC Substation Ballistic Attack have led to heightened security efforts for the Plan Area.

An explosive or electromagnetic pulse detonation occurring anywhere in California could have a critical impact on SMUD’s energy system and/or its ability to maintain continuity in electric service. A targeted attack on SMUD could result in catastrophic damages to its energy infrastructure.

![Electric System Hazard Mitigation](https://example.com/image.png)

**Electric System Hazard Mitigation**

Damage to SMUD’s power plants and ancillary facilities in affected areas can be expected to reduce generating capacity significantly. The potential impact of this reduction in local output is lessened by the availability of power from other sources outside the affected area and by relational reduction in consumer demand. Immediate concerns will focus on repairs necessary to restore power to areas of greatest need. Major restoration problems include supplying chain disruptions, repairs necessary to route power through the major substations, restoration of damaged and collapsed transmission line towers, re-activation of equipment at local substations, replacement of fallen poles, burned transformers, etc. The following table depicts SMUD’s current mitigation efforts of terrorism hazards.

### 17.2 Cyber Threats  
Cyber threats are attempts by criminals to attack a government, organization, or private party by damaging or disrupting a computer or computer network, or by gaining unauthorized access to information on a computer or computer network for malicious use.  

#### 17.2.1 Hazard Profile  
**Exposure and Vulnerability**  
Cyber based attacks gain access to or intrude on critical infrastructure systems, such as financial services, communications systems, energy, or transportation systems, with the potential to alter their reliable functioning. Disruption to such SMUD’s systems could pose a critical threat to local and national security. Over the past years, the threat from cyber terror has grown exponentially in part due to the rapid growth in the use of the Internet and the rapid growth of technology in general. SMUD collects employee, customer, and vendor information on a continuous basis (e.g., job applications, new customer applications, loan forms) for business operations. As SMUD’s electric grid and computer systems become more and more interconnected, and with the increased adoption of new technology (including cloud computing, big data, and mobile device usage), the risk for cyber breach increases.  

**Past Events**  
According to Statista, in 2022, there were 1,802 cases of data compromises in the United States where 422 million individuals were affected in the same year by data compromises, including data breaches, leakage, and exposure. California was the top of the US states according to the CMS OCR breach list for 2022, experiencing 1,338 breaches. As technology begins to advance and become more prominent, users are increasingly more vulnerable to cyber threats.

2022 started with Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine which in addition to human toll, threatened order and put many organizations at risk of spillover cyberattacks. At the same time, China state-nexus adversaries increased their cyber espionage campaigns, and Iranian actors launched destructive “lock and leak” operations using ransomware.74

Cyberattacks are on the increase in the electricity sector. Cyberattacks on utilities have been growing rapidly since 2018, reaching alarmingly high levels in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. More recent attacks in the electricity sector have disabled remote controls for wind farms, disrupted prepaid meters due to unavailable IT systems, and led to recurrent data breaches involving client personally identifiable information. In 2022, the cost of data breach was 4.72 million in the energy sector.75 Figure 30 below shows the average number of weekly cyberattacks by industry for the period 2020-2022.

In May 2021 a ransomware attack on a major petroleum product pipeline’s IT network resulted in major prescriptive measures directing U.S. government agencies to take a series of proactive steps to bolster cybersecurity. The International Energy Authority (IEA) is an international energy forum, its responsibilities include tracking and analyzing global key energy trends, promoting sound energy policy, and fostering multinational energy technology cooperation. It states in one of its articles that there is little public information available on significant cybersecurity incidents due to under-reporting and the lack of detection. That being said, there is evidence that cyberattacks on utilities have been growing rapidly since 2018, reaching alarmingly high levels in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. They anticipate that this trend will only continue. 

### 17.2.2 Current Mitigation Efforts
SMUD participates in several cross-collaborative cyber threat prevention initiatives (see Table 50).

#### Table 50: Current Cyber Threat Hazards Mitigation

| Cybersecurity Incident Plan                  | Cybersecurity Incident occurs. The plan includes several phases and defines various teams to respond to incidents when they occur. SMUD exercises its response plan at least twice per year.                                     |
| Identity access management                    | Periodic verification of user accounts, user groups, or user role categories and that privileges assigned are correct. Implementation of user account to least privileged, restricting user accounts to what is needed to do their job. |
| Privileged Access Management Program (PAM) Project | Installation of hardware and software that prevents people from knowing the passwords to generic or shared accounts. Administrator accounts are managed by the system to prevent users from knowing password.                      |
| Physical security plan                       | Log entry of individuals with authorized physical access to SMUD campus, monitor unauthorized access through physical access points.                                                                                           |
| System security management                    | Evaluate security patches, protect against the use of unnecessary physical input/output ports, generate alerts for security events. SMUD has implemented the Cyber Critical Infrastructure Controls required by NERC Standards and the Cyber Security Controls required by the FERC Division of Dam Safety and Inspection standard. |
| Exercises and testing                        | Conduct periodic exercises and testing to continuously improve the Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan.                                                                                                                     |

### 17.3 Physical Threats
Physical security is the protection of personnel, facilities, information, equipment, operations and activities from physical actions and events that could cause serious loss or damage to an enterprise, agency, or institution. This includes protection from fire, flood, natural disasters, burglary, theft, vandalism, and terrorism.78

### 17.3.1 Hazard Profile
**Asset Profile and Security Personnel**  
SMUD has assets spread over a wide geographical area that differ in criticality, type, and vulnerability. The largest set of assets vulnerable to physical attack are our 300+ substations, which vary in size and protection levels applied to mitigate risk or comply with regulatory requirements. SMUD also maintains a turbine farm in the East San Francisco Bay area covering approximately 5000+ acres. There are two large campus-type environments housing the majority of SMUD’s workforce personnel and operational assets. SMUD also has a smaller campus east of the Sacramento area that houses both personnel and equipment that operate and maintain SMUD’s hydropower assets, consisting of several complexes of dams, powerhouses, and switchyards. The approximate total service territory is 900+ square miles.
<!-- Page 201 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

miles and approximate total asset footprint (not counting gas pipeline) of 3000 square miles. This vast area is serviced by a full-time internal security force.

## Current and Past Incidents
SMUD has experienced a wide range of physical security incidents over the past 5 years. SMUD facilities have been subject to unauthorized intrusions, ballistic attack, theft, burglary, vandalism, and other various petty crimes.

### 17.3.2 Vulnerability Assessment
SMUD is a publicly owned electric utility that owns and operates infrastructure that delivers reliable power to the public and is part of the U.S. Bulk Electric System. Like many utilities, SMUD’s infrastructure, if not underground is above ground or overhead and is generally visible to the public. As such, it makes it an easy target for bad actors to exploit.

SMUD maintains processes and documents to protect the physical security of its properties.

### 17.3.3 Current Mitigation Efforts

### 18.0 Other Hazards

#### 18.1 Air Pollution
Air pollution is defined as the air containing any substance that poses harmful or poisonous effects. Air pollution is hazardous to the health of many citizens residing in SMUD’s Plan Area. Sources of air pollution are grouped into four major categories: stationary, mobile, area-wide and natural sources.

#### 18.1.1 Hazard Profile
Stationary sources of air pollution include small and large fixed facilities such as power plants, dry cleaners, gasoline stations, and landfills. Mobile sources of pollution include cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes. Area-wide sources of pollution may result from agriculture, consumer products, construction grading or unpaved roads. Natural sources include plant pollens, biological decay, windblown dust, and wildfires. The pollutants from these sources and activities are typically broken up into three major pollutant categories: Criteria (affecting people's respiratory health and/or leading to the creation of ground level Ozone and particulate matter), hazardous (known or suspected to cause cancer and/or other serious health effects), and greenhouse gas (contributing to global warming and climate change).

The American Lung Association's 24th annual air report, *The State of Air*, utilized the most recent criteria air pollution data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and ranked California the most polluted state to live in. The report also ranked the Sacramento-

As part of its general monitoring process, SMUD leverages a number of different publicly available resources to monitor and forecast air quality within its service territory as well as areas where SMUD employees work. Figures 31 and 32 below are sample maps and data showing in real time, the air quality in the Sacramento area. This data helps air quality agencies forecast and report the “Air Quality Index” (AQI) to the public based on the prevalent pollutants of an applicable weather season. AirNow defines the AQI “as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.” In the summer, the AQI provides ambient levels of ozone and/or particulate, while in the fall and winter seasons, these monitors identify days with high particulate levels. As described.

18.1.2 Current Mitigation Efforts  
The table below depicts the mitigations for air pollution hazards.

**Table 53: Current Air Pollution Hazards Mitigation**

| Mitigation                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2030 Zero Carbon Plan               | SMUD will continue to evaluate its strategy to reduce its own greenhouse emissions while maintaining electrical reliability for its customers. These strategies include the potential reduction of its fossil fuel use among its power plant fleet, retooling its existing equipment to operate on non-fossil fuels, and/or helping the region electrify both its vehicle and buildings. |
| Air Quality Standards               | SMUD will continue to comply with all local, state, and federal air quality rules and regulations as it applies to its affected equipment and operations. SMUD will also continue to partner with local agencies and industry to influence policies and regulations that improve air quality and reduce potential harmful exposure to poor air quality, and wildfire smoke. |
| Emergency Operations Center (EOC)  | The SMUD Emergency Preparedness Duty Officer will monitor daily National Weather Service forecasts for major air quality impacts and will consider proposing activation of the EOC when AQI is equal to or greater than 500 for two consecutive days across a significant area of the service territory. An AQI at or above 500 is considered an immediate hazard to human health. |
| Worker safety standards             | This standard applies to all SMUD employees, performing various job activities, as identified where the Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM2.5 is greater than 150 to provide guidance on protection for employees during wildfire events. An AQI above 150 to 200 is considered unhealthy for some of the general public, with people in sensitive groups experiencing serious health effects. |
| Building ventilation critical operations | Facilities shall ensure building HVAC filters are inspected and replaced, as needed, during a wildfire event. Facilities will have resources or contracts available to obtain mobile air scrubbers if needed for use at critical infrastructure buildings like the PSO, DSO, Contact Center, Energy Trading, Security Operations. |

18.2 Avalanches  
An avalanche is a weather-related threat that occurs when a mass of snow mixed with ice and debris travels down a mountainside. Avalanches occur in steep mountainous areas of California that receive significant amounts of snow. Avalanches can occur from one or a combination of these components: overloading, temperature, slope angle, snowpack conditions, and vibrations. The most at risk are mountainous areas that have a slope of 25° to 60°.

Avalanches have caused property damage and loss of life in California. Significant events have damaged or destroyed ski resorts at Mt. Shasta and Lake Tahoe. Avalanches have also blocked and damaged roadways. The Plan Area lay amongst the highest regions of avalanche risk in the State of California. Avalanches can pose a major threat to the communities and SMUD’s or WAPA transmission lines, powerhouses, reservoirs, roads, and other infrastructure in the UARP. Secondary impacts may impact SMUD’s customers residing outside of the regions susceptible to avalanches.

Because SMUD has not experienced avalanches, there is not sufficient data to describe the extent of damages.

18.3 Drought and Water Shortage  
Drought is a gradual phenomenon, occurring slowly over a period of time, caused by a rainfall deficit, and often combined with other predisposing factors. It is difficult to quantify the beginning and ending of a drought. There are four different categories in which a drought can be categorized based on its effects (see table 54).

18.3.1 Hazard Profile  
**Table 54: Drought Categories**

| Type                     | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Meteorological drought    | Having below average water supply.                                                              |
| Agricultural drought      | Overdraft of groundwater to meet the state's crops and agricultural needs because of insufficient water supplies. |
| Hydrological drought      | Lacking surface and subsurface water supplies such as snowpack, streamflow, or lakes.          |
| Socioeconomic drought     | Having adverse economic or health impact on a region.                                          |

SMUD’s Plan Area has a Mediterranean climate. The summers are dry and warm, and the winters are wet and cool. Its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and major mountain ranges defines most of the State’s precipitation and runoff. A majority of the water vapor that provides the State’s precipitation comes from the ocean. The snowpack in the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada contributes to the runoff in the rivers and groundwater.  

145 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 208 -->
basins. Approximately 75% of the state’s annual precipitation occurs between November and March. Many California’s droughts stem from an absence, or reduction, of winter precipitation.

**Exposure and Vulnerability**  
California experienced one of the worst droughts in history from 2012 to 2017: 102 million trees died during that time period. This has increased SMUD’s vulnerability for tree mortality. In 2014, 100% of the State was experiencing a drought ranked “severe” or worse. During the period of 2012 to 2015, Lake Tahoe warmed 15 times faster than it had historically. The drought became so severe that Governor Jerry Brown instituted a mandatory 25% water restriction in 2015. The drought exacerbated wildfires during those years.

California’s most significant historical statewide droughts were 1929-34, 1976-77, 1987-92, 2007-09, 2012-17 and 2020-2022 (see table 55).

**Table 55: Historical Droughts in California**

| Year     | Duration (years) | Description                                                                                     |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1929-34  | 6                | Occurred when the state’s urban and agricultural developments were minimal, therefore the impacts to the economy and community were substantial. |
| 1976-77  | 2                | Brief but severe due to the low amounts of precipitation and runoff.                           |
| 1987-92  | 6                | Impacted the entire state of California by almost completely depleting the State’s major water reserves and projects. |
| 2007-09  | 3                | First ever-statewide proclamation of emergency for drought was issued. Water shortages resulted in economic burdens to agriculture and to rural communities. |
| 2012-17  | 6                | Issued California’s second ever-statewide proclamation of emergency for drought. Recorded its lowest annual precipitations in four consecutive years (2012-2015). |
| 2020-22  | 3                | Driest three-year period dating back to 1896, resulting in a state of emergency across California. |

In 2015, at the drought’s most severe point, snowpack was estimated to be at 5% of normal levels. The previous lows for snowpack depletion were in 2014 and 1977, each at 25% of normal levels. During a “normal” year, snowpack contributes 30% of California’s water needs. 

Figure 33 below depicts drought intensities from 2000-2023 compiled by the US Drought Monitor. The drought was at its worst for many months beginning in mid-2014 and extending through the end of 2016. In January of 2017, the multi-year drought abruptly ended.

### Drought Impacts
Drought impacts are felt first by people most dependent on annual rainfall—such as ranchers using dryland range or rural residents relying on wells in low-yield rock formations. Drought impacts increase with the length of a drought, as carry-over supplies in reservoirs are depleted and water levels in groundwater basins decline. The most common secondary effects of drought that are realized by SMUD and occupants in its Plan Area are the environmental impacts such as wildfire hazard, increased tree mortality, the reduced availability of surface water, and the loss of biodiversity in the animal and plant species in the area.

### Past Events
The Plan Area has experienced prior drought conditions in recent years with drought periods recorded 2020-2022, 2012-2017, 2007-09, 2000-04, 1987-92, 1975-77 and 195961. Table 59 shows the available data found for most recent drought events available in the NCDC database for the Plan Area.

Most detrimental to SMUD’s operations and its ability to serve its customers during a drought, is the reduced ability to generate hydroelectric power. A reduction of hydropower generation and water quality deterioration are potential hazards that could affect SMUD during an extended drought period. Droughts have the capacity to affect the following:
- Hydropower: lower water levels impact production capacity in hydroelectric plants.
- Biomass: changes in seasonal precipitation patterns can impact vegetation growth, altering the availability of feedstock for biomass generators.

**18.3.2 Current Mitigation Efforts**  
Based on the results of SMUD’s Climate Readiness Action Plan assessment, SMUD continues to monitor how drought impacts energy generation and commodity costs. SMUD has several initiatives that reduce the risk of water shortages in drought conditions, including the hydro rate stabilization fund that accrues money to purchase replacement power in years with lost hydropower generation. Additionally, SMUD is in cooperation of the SPA with the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (Regional San) to deliver recycled water from Regional San treatment facilities to be used for cooling and fire protection at the SPA power plant. The table below depicts mitigation efforts for drought hazards.

**18.4 Hazardous Material Release**

Hazardous materials have properties that make them potentially dangerous and harmful both to human health and the environment. The Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) regulates hazardous materials in California. DTSC defines hazardous materials as materials with properties that make it potentially dangerous or harmful to human health or the environment. The universe of hazardous materials is large and diverse. Hazardous materials can be liquids, solids, or contained gases.91

**18.4.1 Hazard Profile**

An accidental hazardous material release can occur wherever hazardous materials are manufactured, stored, transported, or used. There could also be incidents of intentional hazardous release either from terrorist or provocateur activities. Depending on the material involved, the release may affect nearby population and/or contaminate critical or sensitive environmental areas within the Plan Area.

The release of hazardous materials to the environment could damage the environment, property, or human health. The extent of damages is dependent on the type, location, quantity, concentration, physical, chemical and/or infectiousness of the material released. Although hazardous material incidents can happen almost anywhere, certain areas of the state are at higher risk. These include areas: near roadways (frequently used for transporting hazardous materials), adjacent to industrial facilities (that use, store, or dispose hazardous materials), and crossed by certain railways, waterways, airways, and pipelines (that transport hazardous materials).

Releases of explosive and highly flammable materials have been known to cause fatalities and injuries, necessitate large-scale evacuations, and destroy millions of dollars' worth of property.

property. Toxic chemicals in gaseous form have been known to cause injuries and fatalities among emergency response teams and passersby. Serious health effects have been known to result when toxic materials enter surface or ground water supplies. Releases of hazardous chemicals have been especially damaging when they have occurred in highly populated areas or along heavily traveled transportation routes.

## 18.4.2 Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD’s Plan Area is a mix of urban, suburban, and rural areas. Military and former military installations located in SMUD’s Plan Area must be considered as potential sources for hazardous material releases. When a hazardous material emergency occurs, multiple resources are available with the local fire departments typically leading response activities. SMUD’s Plan Area contains major transportation arteries, such as interstates, highways, railroads, and airports, each facilitating the transport of hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials through and into SMUD’s Plan Area each year. SMUD is highly exposed to the effects of a major catastrophic hazardous material emergency due to the proximity of the transportation routes to densely populated areas. Additionally, SMUD must be concerned with the Port of West Sacramento and the various bulk gasoline terminals located along the Yolo County side of the Sacramento River front because prevailing winds come from the southwest. Considerations must be made also for the numerous agriculturally related businesses located within the response/mutual aid area.

SMUD’s Plan Area contains major oil and gasoline terminals, drinking and wastewater pumping facilities, and numerous large diameter underground pipelines. Agriculture uses large quantities of pesticides and chemicals that are stored at numerous sites. Fixed facilities are limited to small industrial parks within or near the incorporated cities. Air transportation of hazardous materials involves the smallest quantities but still poses a potential hazard.

There are also numerous underground and aboveground storage tank facilities for flammable liquids throughout SMUD’s Plan Area.

## 18.4.3 Current Mitigation Efforts
SMUD owns and/or operates several potential sources of hazardous materials releases. SMUD follows all federal, state, and local regulations relating to the use, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials. All hazardous material Safety Data Sheets specific to an asset or location are kept on site and also available online. Field and support staffs are trained to respond to leaks, spills, and discharges. All SMUD facilities above regulatory mandated quantity thresholds operate under Hazardous Materials Business Plans (HMBPs) prepared by the Environmental Services Department. These plans are updated annually and certified as accurate with the applicable local governing agency.

## 18.5 Oil Spill
### 18.5.1 Hazard Profile
An oil spill is a release of liquid petroleum into the environment due to human activity or technological error that results in the pollution of land, water, or air. Oil spills can also

18.5.2 Exposure and Vulnerability  
Some of SMUD’s electric and mechanical equipment utilize oils to operate. This equipment and affected facilities are located on land near stormwater systems and waterways. However, SMUD is at very low risk for the likelihood of an oil spill event because of existing mitigations (see table 61: Current Hazardous Materials and Oil Spill Hazards Mitigation).

SMUD’s Plan Area is land-locked and is not susceptible to underwater seeps or disasters related to offshore oil drilling. The most likely oil spill hazards threatening SMUD’s Plan Area is the release of oil from either third-party vehicle accidents (involving SMUD’s oil-containing equipment) or the malfunction/failure of the oil-containing equipment.

Today, our five natural gas plants provide low-cost, reliable power 24/7. Eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from our power plants is essential to reach our zero-carbon goal by 2030. We’re focused on reimagining our existing generation portfolio to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions through replacement, re-tooling and using renewable fuels. To drastically reduce SMUD’s fossil fuel related greenhouse gas emissions, we currently plan to adjust the utilization of the generation fleet by placing at least 2 power plants while exploring retrofit technologies such as alternative fuels and/or post-combustion controls. Maintaining reliable electric service is critical, so we will conduct more detailed reliability assessments before finalizing plans for our natural gas power plants.

We will expand the use of our existing carbon-free energy technologies like wind, solar, hydro, biomass, geothermal energy, battery storage and demand response. While these proven carbon-free technologies aren’t fully capable of achieving our 2030 zero carbon goal, they can help get us about 90% of the way there. Today, SMUD’s power supply is about 50% carbon-free. Our plan includes adding ~3,000 Megawatts of new renewable energy and storage, which is equivalent to the energy needs of more than 600,000 homes per year. This includes growing rooftop and battery storage adoption.

We will explore new and emerging technologies—like power-to-gas technology, hydrogen and methane, long-duration batteries, and carbon sequestration—that are either currently unknown or are not ready for large scale adoption due to price, reliability or other factors. This work will help us identify potential partnerships and business models like virtual power plants, and launch pilot projects and programs to test and prove new and emerging technologies and develop paths for prioritizing technology adoption and scaling.

Our road map to zero carbon identifies cost ranges and rate impacts associated with expanding our existing proven clean technologies and for researching and piloting new technologies and business models. We’re focused on making sure achieving our zero-

**18.5.3 Current Mitigation Efforts**

The table below depicts the mitigation activities for hazardous materials and oil spills.

| **Table 58: Current Hazardous Materials and Oil Spill Hazards Mitigation** | **Description** |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Spill Prevention Control and Counter Measure (SPCC) Program**         | The SPCC program provides mitigation control to prevent discharges of oil, and properly respond to discharges of oil, if it does occur. Facilities with equipment over mandated storage volumes (either individually or cumulatively) are part of a SPCC plan. The plan outlines equipment requirements and engineering controls, inspection criteria and frequencies, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. <br><br> For example, Appendix B of SMUD’s Substation Specific SPCC Plan contains the “Substation Maintenance Oil Spill Cleanup for SMUD Substation Facilities” and the “Environmental Services Oil Spill Response for SMUD Substation Facilities” procedures. These oil spill cleanup and contingency procedures contain guidelines for performing the necessary oil spill cleanup, notifications, and reporting. The Substation Maintenance procedure identifies the actions that shall be taken by Substation Maintenance personnel upon discovering and responding to an oil spill. The Environmental Services procedure identifies the actions that shall be performed by HazMat Services and Environmental Services personnel when responding to an oil spill at a SMUD substation facility. These procedures were written to ensure that any oil spill at a substation facility is cleaned up as expeditiously as possible in an environmentally responsible manner. <br><br> In addition to the information included in the above procedures, the SPCC plans also outline that Substation Maintenance, HazMat Services, and Environmental Services personnel on-call at all times to ensure that an oil spill is cleaned up as soon as reasonably possible; 2) an Emergency Contact List which lists local, state, and federal regulatory agencies as well as key SMUD personnel; 3) guidelines for performing the necessary oil spill notifications and reporting requirements. |

| Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP)     | The HMBP program is overseen by the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) (e.g., a local agency certified by the California Environmental Protection Agency to implement and enforce State hazardous waste and hazardous materials regulatory management programs). The HMBP provides an inventory of materials and outlines mitigation controls to prevent or minimize harm to public health, safety, the environment, from a release of a hazardous material. A HMBP is required when hazardous materials are present above certain threshold quantities at a site. <br><br> The plan contains detailed information about the hazardous materials stored onsite, including but not limited to 1) inventory volumes and/or weights; 2) detailed site map(s) and applicable material storage and handling location(s); 3) important MSDS details and signage; 4) site specific emergency response plans; and 5) personnel training requirements and frequencies; and 6) recordkeeping and reporting requirements. As such, the plan is also shared via an online database with local agencies and first responders. This helps ensure that outside agencies understand the hazardous present at an applicable site. |
| HMBP Emergency Response Plan                 | The Emergency Response Plan is a subset of the HMBP. It is site specific and details the procedures in the event of a release (or threatened release of a hazardous material), including, but not limited to: 1) immediate notification contacts to the appropriate local emergency response personnel and to the CUPA; 2) mitigation of a release (or threatened release) for each hazardous material to minimize any potential harm or damage to persons, property, or the environment; and 3) evacuation plans and procedures.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Training                                     | SMUD’s personnel is trained to handle and report hazardous material and oil spills in the same general manner for facilities storing hazardous materials in quantities below SPCC and/or HMBP applicability thresholds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Engineering Controls and Best Management Practices | SMUD uses a mixture of engineering controls and best management practices (BMPs) to design and operate the facilities and their respective equipment in a manner that reduces the likelihood of a spill or release. Engineering controls include emergency sumps large enough to capture spilled oil within a facility, visual and/or audible alarms to manage storage tank volumes and prevent storage tank overfill, and “oil minder pumps” that prevent the pumping of oil impacted water out of catch basins. BMPs include establishing equipment inspection frequencies, using standard inspection forms, installation of additional signage, and training specific to a site or asset.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Contractor and Vendor Support | SMUD maintains contracts with qualified emergency response environmental contractors and waste vendors. These vendors ensure that SMUD can mitigate releases, remediate an affected site to its original pre-spill condition, and ensure that hazardous materials are handled, transported, and disposed of in accordance with all state and federal requirements. |

### 18.6 Natural Gas Pipeline Hazards

#### 18.6.1 Hazard Profile
SMUD owns and operates 76 linear miles of natural gas pipelines. Natural gas from these pipelines is required to operate SMUD’s thermal power plants and to help SMUD meet its load serving capability. SMUD’s pipelines are in and near communities where people work and live. In operating the pipelines, safety is SMUD’s top priority. SMUD is committed in protecting the people, environment, and communities along these pipelines.

#### 18.6.2 Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD’s gas pipelines are fewer and newer as compared with other utilities. However, in the event of a gas pipeline breach, impacts could result in total loss of assets and damage to surrounds up to and including loss of life. Increasing population growth in urban areas is resulting in a greater number of people living and working closer to existing gas transmission pipelines. The aging of SMUD’s gas transmission system also slightly increases the risk of potential disaster. Causes of and contributors to pipeline failures include third party damage, construction defects, material defects, internal and external corrosion, operational errors, control system malfunctions, outside force damage, subsidence, and seismicity.

#### 18.6.3 Current Mitigation Efforts
The Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is the primary safety regulator of the pipeline system. Its regulations and safety standards address a variety of issues affecting pipeline safety, including pipe and component manufacture, how pipelines are built, operated, maintained, and inspected, how personnel are trained, and how companies respond to emergencies.

SMUD meets and exceeds all regulatory requirements through SMUD Gas Pipeline Operations integrity management program which includes, detective controls through line patrols and leak detection systems, process controls, participation in the USA North 811 system (call before you dig) and engineering controls such as remote operating valves with LineBreak systems to respond to gas leaks. These controls are implemented to ensure public safety and prevent compromise to SMUD’s gas transmission systems.

### 18.7 Nuclear Hazards

Nuclear hazard is referred to as the risk or danger to any living species or environment posed by radiation emanating from the atomic nuclei of a given substance.

#### 18.7.1 Hazard Profile
There are no natural nuclear hazards in the Plan Area. There is a very low probability of accidental exposure of solid material managed by local businesses, including SMUD. Close up, unprotected exposure to radioactive materials can have negative long term health effects.

#### 18.7.2 Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD owns the decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Spent fuel is stored onsite in the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) awaiting the DOE direction to move it to an appropriate facility. Rancho Seco is in Sacramento County, 25 miles southeast of the City of Sacramento and 26 miles northeast of the City of Stockton, the two largest cities within a 50-mile radius of the site. The site occupies approximately 14 of the 2480 SMUD-owned acres at the Rancho Seco site, which is flat to rolling terrain. The nearest population center of 25,000 or more is the City of Galt, which is about 10 miles northwest of the site. State Route 104 runs north of the site in an east-west direction. Route 104 connects with U.S. Route 99 and Interstate 5 to the west and State Routes 88 and 12 to the east.

The area near Rancho Seco is sparsely populated and is used primarily as grazing land and grape vineyards. The only public use facility within a 5-mile radius of the site is the Rancho Seco Reservoir and Recreation Area, which is located approximately 1 mile southeast of the site and is within the land owned by SMUD. There is no indication of geological faulting at the site.

The risk that radiation exposure because of long-term storage of nuclear spent fuel at Rancho Seco may result in environmental, health and safety risks is extremely low. Incidents that lead to a breach of spent fuel canister integrity are unlikely to occur.

The ISFSI Safety Analysis Report (SAR) discusses the design criteria and accident analysis criteria for the spent fuel storage system. It identifies potential incidents such as fires associated with combustible materials, loss of contamination control, natural phenomena, and external human caused events such as terrorism. The ISFSI SAR provides an analysis of

18.7.3 Current Mitigation Efforts  
The table below depicts mitigation actions for radiological hazards.

**Table 60: Current Radiological Hazards Mitigation**

| Mitigation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Rancho Seco site-specific Emergency Plan approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission | In the event of an emergency occurring at Rancho Seco, the site-specific Emergency Plan will be implemented. Response includes activating emergency response facilities; making formal notifications to SMUD’s management, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and Sacramento County Office of Emergency Operations; response and recovery activities. |
| Exercises | Every 2 years, SMUD leads an exercise with outside agencies to verify adequacy of the emergency plan and develop action plans to correct any identified variances as appropriate. Annually conduct on-site drills required by the emergency plan to evaluate training and implementation as well as identify potential deficiencies to correct via action plan. |
| Physical barriers and monitoring | Fence surrounds emergency planning zone with controlled access and various monitoring devices. |
| Law and regulations | SMUD continues to follow and apply rules and regulations under 10 C.F.R. §72.32 and any future updates as required. |
| State and Sacramento County Offices of Emergency Services | Periodic meetings to update agencies on emergency plan changes, share emergency response telephone directory (ERTD), and conduct semi-annual communication testing. |
| Radiation monitoring | Continuous monitoring of radiation badges quarterly. |
| Site specific physical security plan approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission | Site specific plan outlining specific physical security requirements and actions. |
| Monitoring Federal actions | SMUD is monitoring Federal actions for moving spent nuclear fuel. |

18.8 Bird Strike  
Bird strikes are defined as avian/power line interactions including electrocutions, collisions and nesting, avian/wind turbine collisions and avian/aircraft interactions.

18.8.1 Exposure and Vulnerability  
SMUD owns and operates several wind turbine facilities located in Solano County. Collisions between wildlife and turbines often occur, causing detriment to the wildlife as well as damages to SMUD facilities. In addition to damages, collisions between wildlife and turbines can lead to significant operational challenges.
<!-- Page 221 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

18.8.2 Current Mitigation Efforts  
Basic mitigation strategies for bird strike are broken into three strategies: Increase resistance to bird strike, remove birds from an area, or move the infrastructure away from the birds (see Table 61).

**Table 61: Current Bird Strike Hazards Mitigation**

| Mitigation          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Design              | SMUD has an Avian Protection Plan which requires SMUD to implement mortality reduce measures in response to bird-caused outages and the use of avian safe standards where it’s required to maximize phase separation and phase-to-ground clearance to minimize the risk of electrocution or to prevent perching where sufficient clearances cannot be achieved. |
| Wildlife management  | Taking lethal and non-lethal measures to remove wildlife habitats and potential food sources from crucial infrastructure such as wind turbines.                                                                                 |
| Operations          | SMUD has a bird and bat protection plan and an eagle take permit for the Solano Wind project which requires mitigation measures to be implemented when bird mortalities including eagle occur including curtailment of wind turbines to minimize bird mortality. |
| Relocation          | If infrastructure is prone to bird strike, an investment might be made to relocate assets to reduce the likelihood of a hazardous event.                                                                                       |

18.9 Pandemic  
18.9.1 Hazard Profile  
The World Health Organization defines a pandemic as an epidemic occurring over a wide area, usually affecting a large number of people. Pandemics typically occur when a new virus appears, toward which the human population has not built immunity. Historically, SMUD’s Plan Area has seen the influenza pandemics of 1918, 1957, and 1968, the Swine Flu pandemic, and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic.  

18.9.2 Assessment of Vulnerability  
Pandemics are unpredictable and have the potential to adversely impact SMUD’s operations. SMUD’s aptness to predict and meet load demand is challenged heavily during a pandemic. Load demands may be hampered by consumers reacting to social distance.

### 18.9.3 Current Mitigation Efforts
By necessity of the COVID-19 pandemic, SMUD developed extensive pandemic mitigations (see Table 62). SMUD continued reliably delivering power to customers by utilizing the Emergency Operations Center, coordinating with local and state emergency management structures, and utilizing internal workforce health protections.

#### Table 62: Current Pandemic Hazards Mitigation

| Workforce health protections         | SMUD reserves the right to allow employees to work offsite, offer employees vaccinations, and instituting effective employee quarantines as appropriate. |
| Grace period for customer payments   | SMUD has the option to provide a grace period and flexible payments plans for the payment of utility bills and refrain from pursuing collection remedies for unpaid bills for a period of time. |
| No shut-off policy                  | SMUD reserves the right to not disconnect power to a customer for non-payment of its electrical bill under certain conditions. |
| Increase filtration and clean air    | Pilot Project, ionized air filtration for critical spaces.                                     |

### 18.10 Supply Chain Hazards
#### 18.10.1 Hazard Profile
Many disruptors are driving supply chain gridlock and impacting end-to-end operations. Pre-pandemic supply chain vulnerability as a result of geographic concentration continue to be compounded by the effects of the pandemic and increased geopolitical tensions. As such, supply chain disruptions have affected operations across most industries, including.

**18.10.2 Assessment of Vulnerability**  
A number of factors make it challenging for SMUD’s supply chains to operate efficiently and at full value. Material shortage and scarcity of crucial items, such as electric steel, electronic components, and cable, are disrupting supply. SMUD has been impacted by the lack of available transformers, many of which are manufactured overseas. Delivery times in many cases more than doubled, taking years to procure certain critical equipment such as transformers. These challenges continue to be exacerbated by the rise of geopolitical tensions. A recent Kearny article sited that “suppliers recognize the gap between demand and their supply of transformers, but even if they can increase production or bring it onshore, new facilities take time to build. Many shortages show no sign of letting up, with manufacturers struggling to fill orders during emergencies or canceling them altogether.”  

In addition, supply chain shortages increase demand and prices continue to rise. Figure 35 shows the change in price for transformer cost showing largely unchanged prices through 2020 and a rise in 134 percent since then. The Kearny study noted a similar trend for electric wires and cable costs.

Transformer prices were largely unchanged in first year of pandemic...  
...but rose sharply in 2021 and have continued to remain elevated.  

**Cost drivers and trends:**  
- **Raw materials** (for example, copper, steel, aluminum): highly sensitive to commodity cost increases (comprise ~60% of total transformer cost)  
- **Labor**: post-pandemic rate increases applied to a shrinking labor pool hinders production  
- **Technology and overhead costs**

<!-- Page 225 -->
Supply chain disruptions result in increased operational costs, project delays, the loss of productivity, increased lead times and customer impact.

For SMUD, this means potential delays in achievement of our goals, specifically the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. Meeting a 100 percent clean electricity goal by 2030 requires increasing SMUD’s clean energy resource capacities. This means building new renewable energy projects, requiring more materials, many of which are imported. With high reliance on certain materials and competing demand from various industries, SMUD and other utilities are faced with potential delays or increased costs to achieve decarbonization. In addition, increasing customer capacity due to new construction and electrification in some instances requires new facilities be built to meet these demands.

## 18.10.3 Current Mitigation Efforts

The following table depicts mitigation activities for supply chain hazards.

### Table 63: Current Supply Chain Hazards Mitigation

# 19.0 Goals and Objectives

## 19.1 Authorities, Policies, Programs and Resources

SMUD’s mitigation strategy is made up of three components required by Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.). These components are goals, actions, and action plan.

SMUD is owned by its customers, who elect a seven-member Board of Directors. Each director represents a different geographic region within SMUD’s service territory. The job of the SMUD Board is to establish policies and values about how SMUD serves its customers and to set the long-term direction in the form of strategic directives. All important decisions made by SMUD staff must support one or more of the strategic directives.

The development of SMUD’s planning process, risk assessment, goal setting and identification of mitigation actions by SMUD’s PC led to the mitigation strategy and mitigation action plans for the HMP. As part of the development process, a comprehensive review of the mitigation efforts and strategies were conducted by SMUD’s PC, internal and external stakeholders, and subject matter experts (SMEs). The result was the HMP for 2018 HMP were refined and reaffirmed, and goals were added and deleted, as appropriate.

Throughout the process of planning for the HMP, the PC reviewed the results of the hazard identification, vulnerability assessment, and capability assessment. The analysis of the risk assessment allowed the PC to recognize areas in which improvements could be made and provided a framework for the PC to create goals and objectives to develop new mitigation strategies for SMUD’s Plan Area.

Daily operations and decision-making are delegated by SMUD’s Board of Directors to the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer, who along with other members of the Executive Team establish guidelines for SMUD activities. The most prominent guideline set by the Executive Team is SMUD’s 2023-2026 Strategy. The top priority area is to Be Safe Always, which has a direct relationship to hazard mitigation. This commitment at the Executive level to safety is critical for SMUD whose primary activity is the generation and delivery of electricity. Not only is the generation and transmission of electricity an inherently hazardous activity but using stored water in mountainous terrain under pressure as the means of electrical generation expands the hazard.

SMUD management, departments, and employees recognize, value, and support projects that ensure a well-planned, coordinated, efficient, and rapid response in the event of an emergency to protect the lives, environment, and property of the citizens in communities where our assets and operations reside.

## 19.2 Risk Prioritization

SMUD’s HMP leverages its existing ERM framework to identify and determine the hazards that SMUD is most vulnerable to. The ERM framework takes into consideration impacts to

![SMUD Hazard Mitigation Plan](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**19.3 Existing Mitigation Strategies**

To identify and select mitigation actions that need to have additional practices implemented, or changed, the PC began by prioritizing hazards that were of high risk to SMUD’s Plan Area. Hazards of high risk were those in which current mitigation actions needed to be re-analyzed, and it needed to be decided if additional mitigation actions could be implemented using SMUD’s current technological capabilities. Low-priority hazard risks are often mitigated using mitigation actions of less specificity than those of high-priority hazards.

Once priority was determined, the PC analyzed additional actions that supported the identified goals and objectives of the HMP. The PC utilized examples of potential mitigation actions from a variety of other agencies. Preventative mitigation alternatives were discussed for each hazard, and additions were made to the existing strategies as deemed necessary.

Mitigation actions are listed with the associated hazards.

**19.4 Mitigation Action Plans**

Planning and prioritization of projects at SMUD is performed through a variety of mechanisms. High level guidance is provided in SMUD’s 5-Year Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan), which represents a balance between the strategies, projects, programs, and other initiatives aimed at ensuring SMUD’s success in an evolving energy industry. Goals and initiatives referenced in the Strategic Plan translate into more specific, action-oriented policies or projects and thus serve as a framework for achieving the intent of the Strategic Plan.

From this and other forms of guidance, individual asset managers, such as the UARP Asset Manager, must prepare a 3-Year Budget Plan that identifies operations and maintenance (O&M) and capital projects that are anticipated over the course of the next three years. The 3-Year Budget Plan is reviewed by the respective business area Directors and is recommended to the Executives, then the Board for final approval.

The priority associated with each project during each budget cycle is dependent on several factors that affect the relative importance of a project in any given year. Projects are either mandatory or discretionary and their inclusion in any given year’s plan is based on regulatory requirements or their relationship to SMUD’s guiding principles.

SMUD also evaluates projects across the organization to ensure Operational Excellence. This essentially translates into our Project Portfolio Management, which seeks to coordinate and align SMUD-wide resource allocation and operations over a 2-3-year planning horizon. A group of leaders from across SMUD, called the Operational Alignment. 

**166 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028**
<!-- Page 229 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Hazard+Mitigation+Plan+2024+-+2028)

**Team (OAT)**, meets regularly to select the overall portfolio of projects, both mandatory and discretionary, track progress throughout the year, and approve significant changes.

Each of these activities (OAT meetings, departmental planning, and project reviews) employ the same prioritization process that results in the general project classifications of high, medium, and low priority projects. The criterion for the three priority categories includes the following:

### High Priority Project Criteria
- Needed to promote safety and protect the lives of SMUD workers and the public,
- Needed to protect SMUD infrastructure and public property,
- Risks are tied to recent disasters and expected to worsen under climate change,
- Strong public support,
- Viewed favorably or required by regulatory agencies,
- Strongly tied to the maintenance of electric stability and reliability,

20.0 Mitigation Best Practices and Adaptive Capacity  
SMUD carries the primary responsibility for implementing and updating hazard mitigation strategies. The HMP is a living document that will be revised and improved over time to increase its effectiveness in implementing and properly tracking mitigation strategies. Staff will leverage SMUD’s existing planning process in the implementation of this HMP.

20.1 Progress of Mitigation Efforts  
SMUD’s ERM Office (ERMO) (along with various associated business units) will monitor the implementation of each hazard mitigation, and the progress made towards the goals of the evolving, HMP. The PC will review and update the status of the implementation of mitigation actions on an annual basis. To standardize the monitoring of the HMP goals, status updates of its specific goals will be integrated into the existing ERM program activities.

SMUD’s ERM program will consider the following to evaluate the effectiveness of the HMP:  
- Has the risk environment changed?  
- Are there other new and emerging risks that have the potential to impact the Plan Area?  
- Do the identified goals and actions address the current and expected conditions?  
- Have the mitigation actions been implemented or completed?  
- Has the implementation of identified mitigation actions resulted in expected outcomes?  
- Are current resources adequate to implement the mitigation plans?  
- Should additional resources be committed to address the identified risks?  
- What needs to be changed in order to achieve the expected outcome?  

The ERMO is responsible for coordinating periodic discussions with stakeholders to perform a review of mitigations and consider whether mitigations need to be reestablished and/or are still relevant to the corresponding potential hazards.

It is important to note that addressing potential hazards requires viewing hazard mitigation strategies as long-term practices. However, these hazard mitigation strategies have a necessity to constantly evolve and become enhanced due to the growing threat of climate change and the speed of technological advances. Climate change is expected to increase the rate of and exacerbate hazards. This may require the adoption of new technology and the innovation of new mitigation techniques.

SMUD will need to constantly integrate the growing impacts of climate change into the HMP’s hazard mitigation strategies. It is possible that efforts to reduce risk in the short-term may increase risk in the long-term.

20.2 Change in Priorities  
SMUD’s Executive Team reviews changes and proposed additions to the Enterprise Portfolio on a monthly basis to account for changes in commodity markets, work

progression, and adjustments to our priorities. The monthly Enterprise Portfolio Review meeting kicks off with our “Strategic Pulse Check” to ensure staff are focused on key projects and updates are made to the 6 Month Look Ahead. Both financial and performance snapshots are then reviewed for year-to-date progress towards our financial and operational goals. Project starts, stops, and changes impacting the portfolio are discussed for decision by the Executive team. New work presented to this team goes through the same process and scoring methodology as our annual planning process to review business case and resource availability. This information and approvals of new work enables SMUD to continually review and optimize our Enterprise Portfolio.

### 21.1.2 Status of Plan Incorporation Actions

SMUD’s Enterprise Prioritization process helps to ensure alignment across SMUD, focused on delivering the things that are most important to the organization, customers, and community. This includes the evaluation, assessment, and prioritization of work to meet SMUD’s key strategic and operational business goals, strategic portfolio management, and facilitation of Executive investment decisions.
<!-- Page 233 -->
# 21.2 Plan Prioritization

## 21.2.1 Benefit/Cost Review
Initiatives within the action plan must be prioritized according to a benefit/cost analysis (44 C.F.R. § 201.6(c)(3)(iii)). Projects and initiatives that address hazard mitigation will follow SMUD’s current Enterprise Prioritization Process.

SMUD’s Enterprise Prioritization scoring methodology consists of 4 components – Strategic Alignment, Risk, Business Unit Criticality, and Financials. Our Strategic Alignment component encompasses the benefit to the organization and strategy of completing the work. SMUD leverages a weighted scoring methodology, with the individual weighting of each component to be determined annually based on the current environment SMUD is facing for the upcoming year. Typically, the strategic alignment and risk components are more heavily weighted than the other components.

The financial score will only consider costs and financial savings or revenue that will be reflected in SMUD’s budget. Cost savings to customers or risk-based cost calculations are not included. The score requires a calculation of net present value, which is today’s value of expected cash flows minus today’s value of invested cash. Present value of lifetime cost minus present value of lifetime benefit.

## 21.2.2 Grant Pursuit Priority
The priority for pursuing funding for each action was assigned based on the following criteria:

- **High priority** – An action that
  - meets identified grant eligibility requirements,
  - has high benefits,
  - is prioritized via Enterprise Prioritization, and
  - local funding options are unavailable, limited, or available local funds could be used instead for actions that are not eligible for grant funding.

- **Medium priority** – An action that
  - meets identified grant eligibility requirements,
  - has medium or low benefits,
  - is prioritized via Enterprise Prioritization, and
  - local funding options are unavailable, limited, or available local funds could be used instead for actions that are not eligible for grant funding.

- **Low priority** – An action that
  - has not been identified as meeting any grant eligibility requirements.

## Plan Maintenance

178 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 241 -->
# 22.0 Plan Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance

## 22.1 Plan Adoption
SMUD operates under the oversight and guidance of its Board of Directors. SMUD’s 2018 HMP was adopted by SMUD’s Board of Directors on June 24, 2019. As part of the process of updating and implementing the 2024-2028 HMP Update, a preliminary version of this plan was presented to the Board of Directors on (Date) at the (Name of Committee Meeting). Following input from the Board, the HMP was then submitted to Cal OES and ultimately to FEMA for review and acceptance.

Within approximately eight weeks of FEMA’s pre-approval of the HMP, the final plan will be presented to SMUD’s Board of Directors during a regularly scheduled meeting for formal adoption.

## 22.2 Plan Implementation
The effectiveness of the HMP depends on the implementation and incorporation of its action items into existing planning processes. This HMP will serve to support SMUD’s decision-making process in the next 5-years. The mitigation activities will be prioritized according to SMUD’s budget and planning process.

## 22.3 Plan Maintenance
### 22.3.1 Integration with Other Planning Processes
The mitigation activities within the HMP will follow SMUD’s Enterprise Prioritization process as outlined in section 21.3.1. Benefits/Cost Review.

### 22.3.2 Plan Evaluation and Monitoring
Evaluation of progress will be recognized by monitoring changes in the hazard risk-potentials that have been identified previously in the HMP. Changes in risk-potential can be denoted as:
- Increased hazard risk-potential because of a new development. 
- Increased hazard risk-potential because of a changed mitigation strategy.
- Decreased hazard risk-potential because of the success of a mitigation strategy.

Updates to the HMP will include the above changes in risk-potential as well as:
- Recognizing new hazards that arise in SMUD’s Plan Area.
- Utilizing new data or studies on current and/or future hazards.
- Incorporating new capabilities in mitigating specific hazards.
- Incorporating newly acquired assets and all growth and development of current infrastructure.

97 Be it naturally occurring, or human caused.  
179 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 242 -->
Updates to the HMP will also be made to accommodate actions that have failed or are not considered feasible after a review of their consistency with the established progress markers.

### 22.3.3 Plan Update Method and Schedule
SMUD will update the HMP, formally, every five years. The update process will begin in the 3–4-year period to give sufficient time for stakeholder engagement and evaluation of actions. Additionally, SMUD will be tracking the mitigation efforts through its existing business processes. Mitigations will be reviewed during the annual prioritization process and periodic enterprise risk reviews. Progress of any hazard mitigation projects will be tracked through the existing project management reporting process. Updates during these processes will be integrated into the plan as appropriate. The updates will be reviewed by the PC periodically and finalized during the 3–4-year review period. Maintenance of the HMP will be conducted in accordance with DMA 2000.

The ERMO is responsible for initiating plan maintenance, and tracking status updates of installed mitigation efforts and changing threats in SMUD’s Plan Area. Following a hazard event triggering SMUD’s Emergency Operation Center (EOC), the ERMO will revisit the plan to ensure mitigation strategies are being implemented as stated and to discuss possible future changes to the HMP. The next formal plan update for the SMUD HMP will occur five years from the date that this HMP is approved by Cal OES and FEMA.

### 22.4 Continuing Public Involvement
The draft HMP and final approved HMP will remain available to the public on the HMP website. The public can continue to provide comments on the HMP directly to ERM@smud.org and during public Board and Committee meetings. Any public input will be incorporated into the next formal HMP update process.

# Board Monitoring Report 2023
## SD-2, Competitive Rates

### 1. Background

Strategic Direction 2, Competitive Rates states that:

Maintaining competitive rates is a core value of SMUD.

Therefore:

a) The Board establishes a rate target of 18 percent below Pacific Gas & Electric Company's published rates on a system average basis. In addition, the Board establishes a rate target of at least 10 percent below PG&E’s published rates for each customer class.

b) SMUD’s rates shall be competitive with other local utilities on a system average basis.

c) In addition, SMUD’s rates shall be designed to balance and achieve the following goals:

i) Reflect the cost of energy when it is used or exported to the SMUD grid;  
ii) Reduce consumption during periods of high system demand;  
iii) Encourage energy efficiency, conservation, and carbon reduction;  
iv) Encourage cost effective and environmentally beneficial Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) (examples of DERs include but are not limited to rooftop solar, battery storage, and energy reduction applications);  
v) Minimize the rate of change in the transition from one rate design to another;  
vi) Provide customers flexibility and choices;  
vii) Be as simple and easy to understand as possible;  
viii) Address the needs of people with low incomes and severe medical conditions; and  
ix) Equitably allocate costs across and within customer classes.

### 2. Executive summary

a) SMUD is in compliance with SD-2, Competitive Rates.

As of December 31, 2023, SMUD’s rates remain among the lowest in the state and on a system average rate basis are 50.1% below Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) Company’s, which is better than the SD-2 target of at least 18% below on a system average rate basis. Residential average rates are at least 46.8% below PG&E’s residential average rates. See Figure 1 below for details.

There was one rate increase to SMUD’s rates in 2023. Rates for all customers were increased by 2% on January 1, 2023, as adopted by the Board on September 16, 2021. The overall rate advantage between SMUD and PG&E remains well above the SD-2 target of at least 18% on a system average basis.

|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| System average rates 18% below PG&E rates | 50.1% below PG&E on a system average rate basis | 45.5% below PG&E on a system average rate basis | 40.9% below PG&E on a system average rate basis |

2023 marked the continuation of several rate developments that balance the SD-2 requirements and help SMUD maintain our critical financial performance and metrics. In September, the Board approved Rate Resolution 23-09-09 which will allow SMUD to continue to meet California mandates, while addressing the impacts of the current economy and inflation. Despite these rate changes SMUD anticipates continuing to meet SD2 requirements in the future.

In September 2023 the board approved four 2.75% rate increases through 2025 with the first rate increase going into effect on January 1, 2024. These approved increases are, on average, lower than those of other electric utilities in the state of California. These increases are driven by commodity price increases, compliance requirements and inflation, among other things as described in Section 4 below.

The Time-of-Day (TOD) rate continues to encourage residential customers to shift usage out of the 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. peak time-period. On average, TOD rates deliver approximately 86-126MW of reduced load during SMUD's system peak.

### Additional supporting information
The Board establishes a rate target of 18% below PG&E’s published rates on a system average basis. In addition, the Board establishes a rate target of at least 10% below PG&E’s published rates for each customer class.

SMUD continues to maintain average rates that are lower than PG&E’s, both at a system level and by rate class. Figure 1 provides a detailed picture of the difference between SMUD’s and PG&E’s average rates by class in 2023 as well as the difference between rates in 2022.

Notes  
* Projected 2023 average prices for SMUD with rates effective 1-1-23. PG&E average prices in 2023 reflect rates effective 9-1-23, per Advice Letter 7009-E. The rate difference in year 2022 reflects PG&E average rates as of 6-1-22, per Advice Letter 6603-C dated 5-20-22, and SMUD rates effective 3-1-22.  
** CARE vs EAPR includes EAPR & EARMED customers.  
*** There is no indication from PG&E that their CARE rates include customers who have a medical allowance only.  
**** Commercial rates include WAPA credits.  

As seen in Figure 1, the rate competitiveness by class varies for the different customer classes and is at least 46.8% below comparable PG&E class average rates. Since the creation of this annual monitoring report, SMUD has consistently maintained rates that were more than 18% below PG&E. See Appendix A for more details.  

b) SMUD’s rates shall be competitive with other local utilities on a system average basis.  

SMUD’s system average rate is competitive with other local utilities as shown in detail in Appendix B. In general, we are seeing large rate increases across the other local utilities. Even with our approved rate increases in 2024 and 2025, SMUD’s rates remain competitive. For example, Modesto recently approved a two-year rate increase of approximately 13% for 2024 and 2025; that’s in addition to an already adopted cumulative rate increase of 10.5% for 2023 and 2024. Roseville Electric is in the middle of proposing 2 rate increases of 9% each for 2024 and 2025. PG&E rates went up by 13% in 2023 alone, with a separate 17% rate increase effective January 2024.  

c) Reflect the cost of energy when it is used or exported to the SMUD grid  

SMUD’s TOD and restructured commercial rates were designed to more closely reflect the cost of energy when it is used, with prices highest during the peak time periods when the cost of energy is highest. We continually assess our rates as markets and our costs change to determine if any structural changes are needed. For example, we implemented TOD rates in 2018 and restructured our commercial rates in 2021.  

d) Reduce consumption during periods of high system demand  

Both the residential and commercial TOD rates send signals to customers to reduce their on-peak usage. The Peak time for residential customers is 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. while the Peak time for commercial customers under the restructured rates is 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. These Peak time periods reflect the highest $/kWh to encourage customers to shift their energy usage outside of the Peak time-period to reduce system load and help with carbon reduction goals.  

The optional residential Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) rate charges a premium on energy delivered during those few critical times during the summer with highest demand, which is expected to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions when the grid is most stressed. Additionally, customers on the CPP rate receive a discount on energy delivered during the summer Off-Peak and Mid-Peak time periods, encouraging them to shift their energy use to times when the grid is less stressed and clean energy is more abundant.  

e) Encourage energy efficiency, conservation, and carbon reduction  

SMUD continues to encourage energy efficiency, conservation and carbon reduction through the residential and non-residential TOD rates and a variety of programs, such as incentives to install storage, and offering a variety of rebates for energy-efficient appliances, heating and cooling systems, and energy-efficient LED lighting. TOD rates encourage  

GM 24-017  
Board Monitoring Report - SD-2, Competitive Rates  
Page 3 of 12  
<!-- Page 254 -->
![Board Monitoring Report – SD-2, Competitive Rates](https://example.com/image.png)

customers to shift energy use from peak times when energy is more costly and is produced by a larger portion of carbon-emitting generation plants to off-peak times, when there is often excess carbon-free solar generation on our system. By shifting usage to times when non-carbon emitting resources are plentiful, customers not only save money, but they also contribute to reducing carbon emissions and help SMUD achieve our carbon reduction goals. The residential and restructured commercial TOD rates were designed to be revenue neutral, so customers can save money if they shift or reduce their usage from peak hours. More detailed information about rebates and savings tips can be found on smud.org.

f) Encourage cost effective and environmentally beneficial Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) (examples of DERs include but are not limited to rooftop solar, battery storage, and energy reduction applications)

The Solar and Storage Rate (SSR) was designed to work with a series of programs and incentives to help SMUD reach its 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. SMUD started the My Energy Optimizer (MEO) incentives and expanded storage incentives to encourage customers to invest in storage, which could enable the customer to gain additional value from their investment. In addition to the storage incentives, the CPP rate provides customers with solar and storage even more of an opportunity to increase the value of their system, by providing a significantly larger incentive to send power to the grid during critical events. The CPP rate also encourage customers to adopt smart thermostats, as they may be able to save money the CPP rate if they use the thermostats to adjust their energy usage.

Customers that live in low-income, multi-family affordable housing will be able to receive the benefits of solar through the Virtual Solar Option. In the Virtual Solar Option, the building owner may install solar, and the benefits of that solar will be allocated to the residents, providing an avenue for customers to adopt solar even though they do not own their own home.

g) Minimize the rate of change in the transition from one rate design to another

SMUD follows this principle through gradualism and balance between rate implementation and customer satisfaction when making rate structure changes in combination with rate increases. For example, the Commercial Rate Restructure will be phased in over an 8-year period to mitigate bill impacts.

h) Provide customers flexibility and choices

SMUD provides flexibility and rate options to its customers. Residential customers may select custom due dates, budget billing, and net energy metering customers can choose between monthly or annual settlement options. Residential customers are placed on TOD, but they may select the fixed rate or the CPP rate. All customers may make online payments and set up billing alerts. In addition, qualified commercial customers moving to SMUD’s service area may choose between two different Economic Development Rate discount structures, selecting the option that best suits their needs.

SMUD is offering three levels of incentives for customers to install storage. The amount of the incentive increases depending on which programs the customers decide to participate in. The smallest incentive, MEO Starter, is for customers that do not wish to participate in a program, the next highest level, MEO Partner, is for customers that want to participate in the CPP rate, and the highest incentive, MEO Partner+, is for customers that want to participate.

in the Virtual Power Plant program. Detailed information about storage incentives can be found on smud.org.

i) Be as simple and easy to understand as possible

SMUD works to make sure its many programs and rates are simple and easy to understand. For example, staff designed the TOD rate and restructured commercial rates to balance simplicity while still reflecting the cost of energy when it is used. Ongoing customer outreach and education assists customers in understanding new rate designs, pilots and programs.

j) Address the needs of people with low incomes and severe medical conditions

SMUD continues to address low-income customers and those with medical conditions. The Energy Assistance Program Rate (EAPR) and our Medical Equipment Discount Rate (MED Rate) offer customers a discount on their monthly energy costs for those that qualify. The discount for EAPR is determined by Federal Poverty Level (FPL) with the largest discount going to those that need the most assistance. In September 2023, the Board approved the EAPR Rate Stabilization Fund which gives an additional discount to those customers with the greatest need, using discretionary, non-retail funds.

Additionally, through the EAPR and MED Rate discount program we have assisted nearly 2,000 customers with energy education, energy efficient improvements and repairs, and moved them towards our Clean Energy Vision with building and transportation electrification improvements. These programs improve/reduce their overall burden and increase the comfort of their homes.

k) Equitably allocate costs across and within customer classes

To ensure costs are equitably allocated across and within customer classes, staff updates SMUD’s marginal cost study and performs rate costing studies and value of solar studies prior to recommending rate structure changes, such as with TOD, the Commercial Rate Restructure and SSR.

4) Challenges

Rate Pressures

SMUD continues to face cost pressures for compliance and risk mitigation requirements, as well as technology and grid investments to support the safe and reliable operation of the grid. Commodity costs to meet our reliability Renewable Portfolio Standards requirements are increased by $87 million in 2024, along with an increase of $370 million of capital spending to fund new generation, storage projects, substation and line capacity projects in 2024 and 2025. In addition, increased costs for wildfire management, reliability of our hydro facilities, customer programs to support our clean energy vision, and inflation all added pressure to maintaining SMUD’s bottom line. These rate pressures were the drivers and detailed in the 2023 GM Report.

5) Recommendation

It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD 2, Competitive Rates.

## Appendix B: Local Utility Rates

- **Modesto Irrigation District (MID)**: On November 15, 2022, MID approved rate increases of 7.4% effective January 2023 and an additional 3.5% for 2024. On November 14, 2023, the MID Board of Directors approved another round of rate increases of 7.5% for January 2024, and a subsequent 5.5% increase for 2025 to cover costs and power supply cost pressure. A Power Cost Adjustment designed to reflect fluctuating power supply costs was also adopted and will be calculated and applied monthly to customer bills in 2025.

- **Turlock Irrigation District (TID)**: TID has not had a base rate increase since 2015 and there is no indication the utility plans to modify its base rates in 2024. There is no change planned to the Power Supply Adjustment at the moment.

- **Roseville Electric**: Roseville Electric has scheduled three public rate workshops in January 2024 to explain the need of additional rate increases for 2024 and 2025, however they will continue their 8% energy surcharge through December 31, 2024. The utility states that the need for new rate increases is due to several factors, including.

- **Lodi Electric**: On June 7, 2023, the Lodi City Council adopted a rate increase of 2% effective August 2023 for fiscal year 2023-24 and 2% effective July 2024 for fiscal year 2024-25. The staff report describes that the additional needed revenue is being collected through an increase to the monthly customer charge which is intended to cover the fixed costs of the utility – those costs that do not change based on the amount of energy. Lodi also has a monthly energy cost adjustment that adjusts as power costs increase or decrease. The range of the energy cost adjustment for 2023 was -$0.0377/kWh to $0.0671/kWh.

- **Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP)**: LADWP did not have a base rate increase in fiscal year 2022-2023. LADWP does have a pass-through rate mechanism that adjusts quarterly with costs, outside of any base rate increases. This Energy Cost Adjustment (ECA) ranged between $0.10213 and $0.10369 for 2023.

SMUD’s system average rate remains competitive, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 uses 2022 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), which is the most recent actual yearly data available. 2023 values are based on averaged monthly figures through October 2023. Roseville and Lodi do not participate in the reporting of monthly data. System average rates in dollars per kWh is a typical benchmark used in the industry to compare rates and are calculated by taking total electric revenue and dividing it by total kWh retail sales.

Including pass-through mechanisms in rates is a common utility practice, allowing utilities to collect enough revenue to cover their costs without having to increase rates in a formal rate proceeding. SMUD has the Hydro Generation Adjustment, which allows for a small additional charge.

*Includes California Climate Credit

**PG&E Rate Increase Process**

Every three to four years PG&E files a request with California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) with their proposed rate increases. Per the most recent filing dated 12/29/2023, which reflects the true-up and General Rate Case (GRC), PG&E will increase its rates by 17.1% on average effective January 1, 2024.

For 2024, most of the increase is driven by the GRC which supports the continued implementation of the utility’s wildfire mitigation plan, a large portion of which is “undergrounding” 1,230+ miles of lines where wildfire risk is high. Other driving factors include the need to meet growing energy demand and the addition of more renewables.

PG&E is awaiting a decision from the CPUC on their proposed Income-Graduated Fixed Charge, expected sometime in 2024.

Figures 7 and 8 show the comparison to PG&E rates for each step of SMUD’s rate increases in 2024. The charts show that even with the increases, the difference between PG&E's and SMUD's rates still far exceed the directive of SD-2.

# Board Monitoring Report 2023
## SD-3 Board Strategic Direction on Access to Credit Markets

1. **Background**

   Strategic Direction 3 on Access to Credit Markets states that:

   Maintaining access to credit is a core value of SMUD.

   Therefore:

   a. For SMUD’s annual budgets, the Board establishes a minimum target of cash coverage of all debt service payments (fixed charge ratio) of 1.50 times.

   b. When making resource decisions, SMUD shall weigh the impacts on long-term revenue requirements, debt, financial risk and flexibility.

   c. SMUD’s goal is to maintain at least an “A” rating with credit rating agencies.

2. **Executive summary**

   SMUD relies on the use of borrowed funds to pay for a portion of its capital needs on an ongoing basis. The Board adopted SD-3, Access to Credit Markets, to help ensure that SMUD maintains the ability to raise new money at competitive rates in the bond market as needed. Making prudent use of borrowed funds to finance capital improvements can help SMUD to mitigate major rate adjustments in periods of intensive capital expansion, and allows SMUD to allocate the costs of those improvements over their useful lives to the customers who benefit from them. Maintaining access to credit markets supports our objective to be financially flexible to make necessary and timely investment and take advantage of opportunities while remaining competitive.

   One of the most important indicators of an organization’s ability to access credit markets is the independent assessment made by credit rating agencies. SMUD is rated by the three major rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Moody’s, and Fitch, which review SMUD’s credit on approximately an annual basis. The credit ratings assigned are intended to give investors the rating agency’s view of the likelihood that SMUD will repay principal and pay interest on bonds when due. They utilize financial metrics in assessing creditworthiness such as the Fixed Charge Ratio that measures revenue sufficiency to meet obligations, and Days Cash on Hand, a measure of liquidity. They also measure leverage and the capacity to finance future capital projects without placing undue burden on customers, either through borrowing or within our rate structure. SMUD’s overall governance and risk

management practices are also important to the agencies, along with the ability and willingness to raise rates when necessary while maintaining competitive low-cost energy for our customers.

As indicated in the attached ratings agency reports, SMUD demonstrates robust metrics, and, thanks to well-managed cash flow, has the flexibility to target a more conservative fixed charge ratio. The most recent SMUD credit reports from both S&P and Fitch also specifically cite the Board’s demonstrated willingness to raise rates to support financial performance.

Credit ratings heavily impact an organization’s ability to borrow money in the municipal markets, as well as the interest rates they will be required to pay. Higher credit ratings translate into lower borrowing costs. For example, if SMUD’s credit ratings were to fall into a lower category, from AA to A, the impact at today’s rates would be approximately $373k/year for every $100 million borrowed. During a period of financial turmoil, as experienced in early 2020, higher credit ratings allowed SMUD to access credit markets sooner, more easily, and at a lower interest rate than lower rated utilities.

Credit ratings also impact an organization’s ability to conduct general business transactions. Trading partners utilize credit ratings as a factor in assessing their willingness to transact with SMUD, and to determine commercial terms. Stronger credit ratings enable SMUD to negotiate better terms and conditions for contracts, including power purchase agreements, and commercial insurance policies. For example, SMUD’s healthy credit ratings minimize the amount of collateral posting required under many of its commodity contracts to hedge natural gas and power. Likewise, if SMUD’s ratings were to drop from current levels, collateral posting requirements would increase accordingly. In some cases, a reduction in SMUD’s credit ratings below a certain threshold gives our counterparty the right to terminate the contract.

In addition to cash on hand, SMUD maintains a liquidity program consisting of a commercial paper program and a line of credit. The commercial paper program enables SMUD the ability to issue up to $300 million of commercial paper notes to obtain funding quickly, when it’s necessary to maintain our liquidity levels. Similarly the line of credit allows SMUD access to up to $100 million on short notice but has the advantage that it isn’t dependent on investor demand. The commercial paper program and line of credit are instrumental in providing comprehensive liquidity support for its operations and capital initiatives. The liquidity program helps to maintain our credit ratings and mitigate many enterprise risks that are otherwise difficult or financially prohibitive to mitigate through standard means. The commercial paper program and line of credit are structured with agreements from three separate banks, further reducing concentration risk and enhancing overall execution.

f. Successfully mitigated interest rate risk in a volatile market environment by strategically refunding $200 million worth of Commercial Paper through the issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt. This transaction, which also was SMUD’s first ever Climate Bond certified Green Bond issuance, also ensured that the entire $400 million capacity remains available to meet our future borrowing requirements to support our capital improvement program and Zero Carbon Plan.

g. Accessed credit markets with multiple issuances and rollovers of commercial paper totaling $150 million outstanding by the end of 2023. The commercial paper issuances were to support SMUD’s liquidity needs and capital improvement program.

h. Additional supplemental contributions of $44 million were made to CalPERS. This was part of a 10-year pension funding strategy to eliminate our unfunded pension liability, which is an obligation rating agencies are increasingly focusing on in their reviews. Addressing the unfunded liability sooner will help control rate increases. These costs would continue to grow into the future since paying only the required minimum payments may not fully mitigate the compounding nature of the outstanding liability adequately. SMUD’s most current valuations show the Pension funded status at 88% as of June 30, 2022, and the funded status of Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) at 92% as of June 30, 2023.

i. Continued to successfully manage the property and casualty insurance programs amidst a historically challenging market, renewing most programs within expiring terms and conditions. Obtaining wildfire coverage remains a challenge, but even in this tumultuous market SMUD successfully increased the program limit by $25 million, and reduced the self-insured portion of the first $100 million layer by $12.5 million.

j. Negotiated a $50 million advance payment on the anticipated claim recovery for the Cosumnes Power Plant (CPP) steam turbine failure insurance claim. SMUD also settled the property damage claim for the CPP steam turbine failure which resulted in SMUD receiving a $13.6 million payment.

3. Additional supporting information

Details on ratings variables, SMUD specific credit strengths, factors that could lead to an upgrade, and insurance are listed below.

Financial Strengths:

c. Rate Competitiveness  
d. Cost of production/purchased power (particularly with respect to higher cost renewables)  
e. Risk Management Practices  
f. Service area demographics  
g. Regulatory factors  

**4. Challenges:**  
Below are comments from recent rating’s agency reports regarding challenges to SMUD’s financial strength that could affect SMUD’s ability to access credit markets:  
a. Wildfire liability and inverse condemnation exposure  
b. More significant capital spending affecting rate competitiveness and key financial metrics  
c. Substantially weakened competitive position or impaired ability to maintain liquidity and achieve fixed charge ratios commensurate with recent years’ levels  
d. Prioritizing environmental goals or rate affordability over preservation of the financial profile  

**5. Recommendation:**  
It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD SD-3 Board Strategic Direction on Access to Credit Market.

**DEPARTMENT**  
Procurement, Warehouse and Fleet  

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and award a sole source Master Services Agreement with Iron Networked Solutions, Inc. (“Itron”) to purchase hardware, software, and professional services to enhance the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) platform for an amount not to exceed $42.5M.  

**Summary:**  
The AMI platform is comprised of communication infrastructure equipment (smart meters), a communication network and back-office systems, which was originally implemented in 2009 and partially funded by SMUD’s SmartSacramento Smart Grid Investment Grant.  

During 2021 and 2022, as part of SMUD’s Next Generation AMI Roadmap, use cases supporting the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (ZCP) were analyzed. The AMI Roadmap identified the next generation of smart meters as a key enabling technology required to support many of the use cases under the ZCP as they provide advanced functionality and additional data granularity. In October 2023, SMUD was awarded a $50 million grant from the Department of Energy Grid Deployment Office’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program, and Itron was identified as a named partner for new technologies to increase reliability, efficiency, and flexibility of the electric grid. Itron was selected as a partner since they are the only meter manufacturer with a commercially available next generation Distributed Intelligence (DI) enabled smart meter and associated DI applications deployed at scale that are compatible with our existing AMI network. As part of the grant, SMUD will deploy 200,000 Itron Riva edge computing sensors with measurement capabilities (smart meters) and eight (8) DI applications with deployment beginning in September 2024 and continuing through the end of 2025. The GRIP grant is SMUD’s first step in our journey to life cycle our meters, replacing 200,000 meters by the end of 2025, as SMUD’s existing smart meters are nearing the end of their design life. This contract will allow SMUD to move forward with ordering meters, software, and professional services to meet the GRIP grant deployment schedule for 2025 and beyond. In Q4 2023, SMUD obtained Board approval to execute a direct sole source agreement with Itron for the initial purchase of the meters due to global supply chain lead time constraints of 12+ months. As previously communicated, SMUD is now seeking Board approval to negotiate and award a subsequent master agreement with Itron to purchase the remainder of the meters, software, and professional services.  

Because Itron manufactures the only commercially available DI enabled meter that is compatible with our existing AMI mesh network and back-office systems and does not have any resellers, issuing a competitive solicitation would be an idle act.  

The Itron Riva edge computing sensors (smart meters) with measurement capabilities are priced competitively, within 11% on average compared to our existing legacy smart meters that lack the DI enabled capabilities. The cost per meter for the most common form factors is within 9% of their legacy smart meter equivalents. Costs for the software and professional services are found to be competitive when

**Recommendation:** Award a Sole Source contract to:  
**Itron Networked Solutions, Inc.**  
2111 North Molter Road  
Liberty Lake, WA 99019  

**Comments:** This will be a non-standard contract that is being negotiated by SMUD.  

**Board Policy:**  
(Number & Title)  
Board-Staff Linkage BL-8, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement; Strategic Direction SD-4, Reliability; Strategic Direction SD-7, Environmental Leadership  

**Benefits:**  
Ability to continue purchasing the smart meters, associated software, and professional services required to enhance the AMI platform while also meeting supply chain lead time constraints and GRIP grant obligations.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
$42.5M; Budgeted by Information Technology.  

**Alternatives:**  
If this contract is not approved, SMUD will not be able to fulfill the obligations proposed in the GRIP grant due to supply chain lead time constraints, which would not be in our best interest. Additionally, due to the proprietary nature of the products and services provided by Itron to support our existing network, issuing a competitive solicitation would be an idle act.

# RESOLUTION NO. ________________

WHEREAS, the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) platform, originally implemented in 2009 and partially funded by SMUD’s SmartSacramento Grid Investment Grant, is comprised of communication infrastructure equipment (smart meters), a communication network, and back-office systems; and

WHEREAS, in 2021 and 2022, as part of SMUD’s Next Generation AMI Roadmap, use cases supporting the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan were analyzed and next generation smart meters were identified as a key enabling technology required to support many of the use cases due to their advanced functionality and additional data granularity; and

WHEREAS, in October 2023, SMUD was awarded a $50 million grant from the Department of Energy Grid Deployment Office’s (DOE) Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program, wherein Itron Networked Solutions, Inc. (Itron) was a named partner, for new technologies to increase reliability, efficiency, and flexibility of the electric grid; and

WHEREAS, as part of the GRIP grant, beginning in September 2024 and continuing through 2025, SMUD will deploy 200,000 Itron Riva edge computing sensors with measurement capabilities (smart meters) and eight Distributed Intelligence (DI) applications; and

WHEREAS, by Resolution No. 23-12-05, adopted on December 14, 2023, this Board authorized sole source Contract No. 4600001818 with Itron for a one-year term in the amount of $15 million, plus applicable taxes and fees, for the initial purchase of meters due to global supply chain lead time constraints of 12-plus months; and
<!-- Page 283 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=DRAFT)

WHEREAS, Itron is the only metering manufacturer with a commercially available DI-enabled meter and associated DI applications deployed at scale, has the only DI-enabled meter compatible with SMUD’s existing AMI mesh network and existing back-office system, is a named partner in the GRIP grant, and does not have any resellers; and

WHEREAS, the Itron Riva edge computing sensors (smart meters) with measurement capabilities are priced very competitively (within 11% on average compared to SMUD’s existing legacy smart meters that lack the DI-enabled capabilities) and the cost per meter for the most common form factors is within 9% of their legacy smart meter equivalents; and

WHEREAS, costs for software and professional services are found to be competitive when compared to other software products and associated professional services purchased by SMUD and thus are considered fair and reasonable; and

WHEREAS, it would not be productive or in the best interest of SMUD to advertise for competitive bids for the products and services referred to above because they can only be obtained from Itron; NOW, THEREFORE,

BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:

Section 1. That the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his designee, is authorized on behalf of SMUD to negotiate and execute a sole source Master Services Agreement with Itron Networked Solutions, Inc. to purchase hardware, software, and professional services to enhance the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) platform in an amount not to exceed $42,500,000.

**Section 2.** The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his designee, is authorized to make future changes to the terms and conditions of the contract that, in his prudent judgment: (a) further the primary purpose of the contract; (b) are intended to provide a net benefit to SMUD; and (c) do not exceed the authorized contract amount and applicable contingencies.

**Requested Action:**  
Approve an increase to the aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount for general line construction services by $12 million, from $44 million to $56 million, for Contract No. 4600001474 with Hot Line Construction Inc. and Contract No. 4600001475 with Mountain G Enterprises.

**Summary:**  
The original contracts were awarded on a competitive basis to Hot Line Construction, Inc. and Mountain G Enterprises in March 2021 per Resolution No. 21-03-06. The original contract was awarded for the period from March 22, 2021, to March 21, 2023, for an aggregate not-to-exceed amount of $20 million. The work generally consists of overhead and underground line construction and maintenance on 12kV and 69kV sub transmission lines. In October 2022, Resolution No. 22-10-1 approved an increase to the aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount from $20 million to $40 million. Releasing the 10% contingency increased the not-to-exceed amount to $44 million.

SMUD has been adversely affected by the labor climate induced by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and their ongoing commitment to reduce wildfire risk across its service area. As a result, SMUD has lost contract crews that supported critical Line Assets programs. This loss has caused Line Assets to strategically realign its workload and the work performed by internal SMUD crews. Securing the services provided by Hot Line Construction Inc. and Mountain G Enterprises will allow the business unit the ability to augment general line construction work while maintaining flexibility in its realignment efforts.

Additionally, the January 2023 Storm Event, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) labor increases, and Local Agency projects accelerated the contract spend rate resulting in a $12 million shortage of funding, which brings SMUD to request the Board to approve a $12 million increase to the aggregate not-to-exceed amount from $44 million to $56 million to support general line construction work planned through the end of this contract. Without the additional funding planned projects would be delayed resulting in customer impact. Currently, the contract balance is approximately $5,200,955.

**Contract Change No. 01 to Contract No. 4600001474 with Hot Line Construction Inc. increased their rates by 7.14%. A portion (5.44%) of the increase accounted for labor as a direct result of Hot Line’s agreement with the IBEW 1245 that became effective on June 1, 2022. The remaining portion (1.7%) of the increase was for increased fuel costs since the time of bid. Additionally, this contract change extended the expiration date to March 21, 2025.**

**Contract Change No. 02 to Contract No. 4600001474 with Hot Line Construction Inc. increased rates to align with current published rates from Hot Line Construction Inc.’s IBEW 1245 Agreement for years 2023 and 2024.**
<!-- Page 287 -->
![Contract Change Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Contract+Change+Document)

Contract Change No. 01 to Contract No. 4600001475 with Mountain G Enterprises increased Rate Schedule, Part B, Line Items 11 and 12 by ~36% and ~45%, respectively.

Contract Change No. 02 to Contract No. 4600001475 with Mountain G Enterprises added subcontractor, WBE Traffic Control Inc., to Exhibit 1 - Designation of Prime Contractor, Subcontractors and Suppliers to perform traffic control where lane closures and/or night work is required. WBE Traffic Control Inc. is a verified Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) vendor.

Contract Change No. 03 to Contract No. 4600001475 with Mountain G Enterprises increased their rates by 5.2% as a direct result of Mountain G Enterprises’ agreement with the IBEW 1245 that became effective on June 1, 2022. Additionally, this contract change extended the expiration date to March 21, 2025.

Contract Change No. 04 to Contract No. 4600001475 with Mountain G Enterprises modified invoicing terms from Net 45 days to Net 30 days and increased rates to align with current published rates from Mountain G Enterprises’s IBEW 1245 Agreement for years 2023 and 2024.

**Requested Action:**  
Approve an increase to the aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount for vegetation management utility line and subject pole clearance services by $10 million, from $171.6 million to $181.6 million for Contract No. 4600001364 with Wright Tree Service of the West, Inc. (Wright Contract) and Contract No. 4600001365 with The Original Mowbray’s Tree Service, Inc. (Mowbray Contract) (collectively, the “Contracts”).

**Summary:**  
The Contracts were awarded on a competitive basis to The Original Mowbray’s Tree Service, Inc. (Mowbray’s) and Wright Tree Service of the West, Inc. (WTS) in March 2020 per Resolution No. 20-03-05. The Contracts were awarded for a three-year term starting March 23, 2020, with two optional one-year extensions for each contract for a total not-to-exceed aggregate amount of $156 million. The scope requires the contractors to provide all supervision, labor, materials, equipment, and incidentals necessary to perform right-of-way vegetation maintenance work on SMUD’s Transmission and Distribution Systems on a task order basis. In January 2024, the 10% allowable contingency ($15.6 million) was released to ensure the Contracts are fully funded.

This Board action is requesting approval of an additional $10 million dollars to support SMUD’s routine maintenance Vegetation Management Program to ensure safety and reliability of SMUD’s electric system. The driver for the additional funding request was due to unplanned work as a result of the 2023/24 January storms series.

The balance of funds available for continued work from the Contracts is approximately $27.5 million.

**Contract Change No. 01 to the Wright Contract** replaced Exhibit D, Performance Bond and Exhibit E, Payment Bond forms with revised annual bond forms.

**Contract Change No. 01 to the Mowbray Contract** added wildfire liability to $15M General Liability Insurance Requirements and reduced Rate Schedule Items 70 -79, 87-98, 100-103, and 105-106 by an average of 69% resulting in a total contract savings of 1% for the initial three-year term, and an additional 1% for each of the two option years. This contract change did not change the total not-to-exceed aggregate contract amount.

**Contract Change No. 02 to the Wright Contract** added Skyline Tree Enterprise, Inc. as a designated subcontractor to assist WTS with the performance of utility line clearance services and added Sierra Integrated Services, Inc. as a designated subcontractor to perform pole clearing work via herbicide spraying.

**Contract Change No. 02 to the Mowbray Contract** added subcontractor R&B Quality Tree Care, Inc. to Exhibit I, Designation of Prime Contractor, Subcontractors and Suppliers. Under this contract, R&B Quality Tree Care, Inc. was designated to perform vegetation management services under Mowbray’s.
<!-- Page 293 -->
![Contract Changes Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Contract+Changes+Document)

R&B Quality Tree Care, Inc. has an “A” grade in the International Suppliers Network (ISN). This change did not require any adjustment to the contract amount.

Contract Change No. 03 to the Wright Contract substituted Skyline Tree Enterprise, Inc. for Maximus Tree Works as the designated subcontractor to assist WTS with the performance of utility line clearance services.

Contract Change No. 03 to the Mowbray Contract adds subcontractor California Trees Inc. dba Cal Trees to Exhibit I, Designation of Prime Contractor, Subcontractors and Suppliers. Under this contract, Cal Trees was designated to perform vegetation management services under Mowbray’s. Cal Trees has an “A” grade in ISN. This change did not require any adjustment to the contract amount.

Contract Change No. 04 to the Wright Contract added subcontractors P31 Enterprises, Inc., VM Tree Service, and R&B Quality Tree Care, Inc. to Exhibit I, Designation of Prime Contractor, Subcontractors and Suppliers. Under this contract, P31 Enterprises, Inc., VM Tree Service, and R&B Quality Tree Care, Inc. were designated to perform vegetation management utility line clearance services under WTS. All three of these subcontractors have an “A” grade in ISN. This change did not require any adjustment to the contract amount.

Contract Change No. 04 to the Mowbray Contract revised the address and point of contact for Mowbray’s. This change did not require any adjustment to the contract amount.

Contract Change No. 05 to the Wright Contract included an increase in rates by 2.75%. SMUD Vegetation Management, Budget and Procurement staff had dialogue with representatives from both WTS and Mowbray’s regarding their request for labor-specific rate increases to the Contracts, driven by provisions of Senate Bill 247 (Dodd) Wildfire prevention: vegetation management (SB 247) and the related ratification of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Labor Agreement in July 2022 (IBEW Labor Agreement). Staff validated the increases for each year. The rate increases apply to Veg Mgmt. IBEW labor only. Contractors did not request increases in Fuel, Insurance, or Equipment.

Contract Change No. 05 to the Mowbray Contract increased rates by 2.8% in year 3 (retroactively effective as of June 1, 2022), 1.8% in option year 4, and 1.7% in option year 5, due to and driven by provisions of SB 247, and the related ratification of the IBEW Labor Agreement. Staff validated the increases for each year. The rate increases apply to Veg Mgmt. IBEW labor only. Contractors did not request increases in Fuel, Insurance, or Equipment.

Contract Change No. 06 to the Mowbray Contract extended the expiration date from March 23, 2023, to March 22, 2025 (exercising Option Years 1 and 2), and reduced rates across the majority of line items by an average of 3.8% in Option Year 1 (effective March 23, 2023), and by an average of 5.4% in Option Year 2 (effective March 23, 2024).

Contract Change No. 06 to the Wright Contract included an increase in rates on overtime equipment/operator line items. These increases align with the increases previously approved via CC-5.

Contract Change No. 07 to the Mowbray Contract removed Performance and Payment Bond Requirements.

Contract Change No. 07 to the Wright Contract extended the expiration date from March 23, 2023, to March 22, 2024 (exercising Option Year 1 only), and reduced rates to select line item by an average of 2.9% effective June 1, 2023.

Contract Change No. 08 to the Wright Contract amended the Rate Schedule to include Line Items 112 – 117, for a 100’ Aerial Lift with Operator, Skid Steer with Operator, and Backyard Lift with Operator at straight time and overtime rates.

Contract Change No. 09 to the Wright Contract removed Performance and Payment Bond Requirements.

Contract Change No. 10 to the Wright Contract extended the expiration date from March 23, 2024, to March 22, 2025 (exercising Option Year 2).

Releasing the 10% contingency in January 2024 increased the not-to-exceed amount of the Contracts to $171.6 million.

(i) Defined Terms. As used in this Section 1.1:

(A) “Letter of Credit Fee Rate” shall mean the rate per annum corresponding to the Rating (as defined below), as specified in the applicable Level in the below applicable pricing matrix for each day in the related fee period.

(B) “Stated Amount” shall mean the Original Stated Amount (i) less the amount of all prior reductions pursuant to drawings with respect to the payment at maturity of the principal of and interest at maturity of the Notes, (ii) less the amount of any reduction thereof pursuant to a reduction certificate in the form of Annex B to the Letter of Credit, (iii) plus the amount of all reinstatements as provided in the Letter of Credit.

(ii) For the period commencing on February [__], 2024 to but excluding April 1, 2025, the Letter of Credit Fees shall be an amount equal to the product of (i) the Letter of Credit Fee Rate determined in accordance with the pricing matrix set forth below, times (ii) the Stated Amount (without regard to any reduction of the Stated Amount subject to reinstatement) for each day in the related fee period.

| LEVEL | MOODY’S RATING | S&P RATING | FITCH RATING | LETTER OF CREDIT FEE RATE |
|-------|----------------|------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Level 1 | Aa3 or above | AA- or above | AA- or above | 0.29% |
| Level 2 | A1 | A+ | A+ | 0.39% |
| Level 3 | A2 | A | A | 0.49% |
| Level 4 | A3 | A- | A- | 0.59% |
| Level 5 | Baa1 | BBB+ | BBB+ | 0.69% |
| Level 6 | Baa2 | BBB | BBB | 0.79% |
| Level 7 | Baa3 | BBB- | BBB- | 0.89% |

**MOODY’S** | **FITCH** | **LETTER OF CREDIT**  
**LEVEL** | **RATING** | **S&P RATING** | **RATING** | **FEE RATE**  
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---  
Level 3 | A2 | A | A | 0.52%  
Level 4 | A3 | A- | A- | 0.62%

Level 7 | Baa3 | BBB- | BBB- | 0.92%  

The following paragraphs shall apply to all pricing matrices set forth above. The term “Rating” as used herein shall mean the long-term unenhanced debt rating assigned by Moody’s, Fitch and S&P to any Debt of SMUD secured by or payable from Net Revenues on a parity with Bonds and Parity Bonds. In the event of a split rating (i.e., the Rating of one of the Rating Agencies’ is different than the Rating of any of the other Rating Agencies), the Letter of Credit Fee Rate shall be based upon the Level in which the lowest of the two highest Ratings appears (for the avoidance of doubt, Level 7 is the Level with the lowest Ratings and Level 1 is the Level with the highest Ratings for purposes of the above pricing grids). In the event that less than three Rating Agencies then assign a long-term unenhanced debt rating to Bonds and Parity Bonds, the Letter of Credit Fee Rate shall be based upon the Level in which the lower Rating appears. Any change in the Letter of Credit Fee Rate resulting from a change in a Rating shall be deemed effective as of and on the date of the announcement of the change in such Rating. References to ratings levels above are references to rating categories as presently determined by the Rating Agencies and in the event of adoption of any new or changed rating system, including, without limitation, any recalibration or realignment of Rating in connection with the adoption of a “global” rating scale, the rating from the Rating Agency in question referred to above shall be deemed to refer to the rating category under the new rating system that most closely approximates the applicable rating category as currently in effect. In the event that a Rating is suspended or withdrawn (for the avoidance of doubt, a decision by SMUD to cause a Rating Agency to no longer maintain its Rating, for non-credit related reasons and not for the purpose of avoiding the occurrence of an event of default, shall not constitute a suspension or withdrawal of such Rating) from any Rating Agency or upon the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Letter of Credit Fee Rate shall increase to the sum of the Letter of Credit Fee Rate specified above for Level 7 in the applicable pricing matrix above plus 1.50% per annum. The Letter of Credit Fees shall be payable as set forth above, together with interest on the Letter of Credit Fees from the date payment is due until payment in full at the Default Rate.

For the avoidance of doubt, at all times prior to February [__], 2024, the Letter of Credit Fees shall be payable and determined in accordance with the Existing Fee Letter.

**Section 1.2. Annual Draw Fee.** SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank a non-refundable draw fee of $2,000, which shall be paid annually in advance within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice from the Bank.

**Section 1.3. Amendment Fee.** SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank on the date of any amendment, modification or supplement to the Agreement, the Letter of Credit or this Fee Letter or in connection with any amendment to any Program Document which requires a waiver from, or the consent of, the Bank, a non-refundable amendment fee in an amount equal to $2,500, plus the reasonable fees of any legal counsel retained by the Bank in connection therewith.

**Section 1.4. Transfer Fee.** SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank on the date of each transfer of the Letter of Credit to a successor Depositary, a non-refundable transfer fee in an amount equal to $2,500, plus the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Bank in connection therewith.

**Section 1.5. Termination Fee; Reduction Fee.** (a) SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank a termination fee in connection with any termination or replacement of the Letter of Credit by SMUD prior to February 21, 2025, in an amount equal to the difference between (A) the product of (i) the Letter of Credit Fee Rate in effect on the date of such termination or replacement under the applicable pricing matrix above, (ii) the Stated Amount in effect as of the Second Amendment Effective Date and (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of days from and including the date of such termination or replacement to and including February 21, 2025, and the denominator of which is 360, and (B) any amount paid to the Bank pursuant to Section 1.5(b) hereof (the “Termination Fee”), payable on the date of such termination or replacement; provided, however, that no such Termination Fee shall be payable if (i) the short-term unenhanced ratings of the Bank are reduced below “P-1” (or its equivalent), “A-1” (or its equivalent) or “F1” (or its equivalent), by any two of Moody’s, S&P or Fitch, respectively; (ii) the Notes are refinanced in full from the proceeds of fixed rate long-term debt issuance or a source of funds which, in either case, does not involve the issuance by a bank or other financial institution of a letter of credit, liquidity facility, or credit facility or a direct purchase of such debt by a bank or other financial institution; or (iii) the Bank imposes on SMUD increased costs pursuant to Section 2.14 of the Agreement; provided that this clause (ii) shall not be construed to relieve SMUD of any of its obligations under Section 2.14 of the Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything set forth herein or in the Agreement to the contrary, SMUD agrees not to permanently reduce the Stated Amount below the Stated Amount in effect as of the Second Amendment Effective Date prior to February 21, 2025, without the payment by SMUD to the Bank of a reduction fee in connection with each and every permanent reduction of the Stated Amount in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Letter of Credit Fee Rate in effect under the applicable pricing matrix above on the date of such reduction, (ii) the difference between the Stated Amount (without regard to any reduction of the Stated Amount subject to reinstatement) prior to such reduction and the Stated Amount (without regard to any reduction of the Stated Amount subject to reinstatement) after such reduction, and (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of days from and including the date of such reduction to and including February 21, 2025, and the denominator of which is 360 (the “Reduction Fee”); provided, however, that no such Reduction Fee shall be payable if (i) the short-term unenhanced ratings of the Bank are reduced below “P-1” (or its equivalent), “A-1” (or its equivalent) or “F1” (or its equivalent), by any two of Moody’s, S&P or Fitch, respectively; (ii) the Notes are refinanced in full from the proceeds of fixed rate long-term debt issuance or a source of funds which, in either case, does not involve the issuance by a bank or other financial institution.

![SUMMARY](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SUMMARY)

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) was formed by vote of the electors in 1923 under provisions of the California Municipal Utility District Act (Division 6 of the California Public Utilities Code) (the “Act”). The Act provides SMUD with broad powers to acquire, construct, own and operate works for the supplying of light, water, heat, power, communications, transportation and other services for its inhabitants. The Act also confers upon SMUD the necessary rights and powers for the conduct of business, including the right to sue and be sued, to exercise the power of eminent domain, to enter into contracts of all kinds, to take property and construct works, to fix rates and charges for commodities or services furnished, to incur indebtedness and issue bonds or other obligations and to invest its funds.

SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities. SMUD’s headquarters are located in the city of Sacramento (the “City”) and its service area of approximately 900 square miles includes the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. The service area includes the state capital, the City, the populous areas principally to the northeast and south of the City and the agricultural areas to the north and south. The City is located 85 miles northeast of San Francisco.

The Commercial Paper Notes, Series M consisting of Subseries M-1 and Subseries M-2 (the “Subseries M-1 Notes” and the “Subseries M-2 Notes” and, collectively, the “Notes”) are secured by a package of Available Revenues, as described herein and supported by an irrevocable, transferable, direct-pay letter of credit, as amended (the “Letter of Credit”) in substantially the form attached hereto as Appendix A and issued by Bank of America, N.A. (the “Bank”) pursuant to a Reimbursement Agreement between SMUD and the Bank, dated as of February 1, 2019, as amended (the “Reimbursement Agreement”). The Bank has issued the Letter of Credit in the aggregate maximum stated amount of $256,164,384 (consisting of $250,000,000 principal plus ninety (90) days interest calculated at a rate of 10% per annum assuming a 365-day year). The Notes will be issued in book-entry form through the Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). See “The Commercial Paper Notes” herein.

This material relating to SMUD is for general informational purposes. While SMUD considers the material relating to SMUD reliable, SMUD does not represent that it is a complete and accurate disclosure of the facts pertaining to SMUD. Investors are expected to base their investment decisions solely on the liquidity and credit support provided by the Bank, rather than the financial and operating history of SMUD, which this Commercial Paper Memorandum does not purport to fully disclose. Additional information about SMUD is available from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board’s (the “MSRB”) Electronic Municipal Access System (“EMMA”). See also “Additional Information” herein.

If for any reason the Bank fails to honor a properly presented and conforming drawing under the Letter of Credit, SMUD cannot provide any assurance that it will have sufficient funds on hand and available to make such payment of principal and/or interest on the Notes supported by the Letter of Credit or to make such payments in a timely manner.
<!-- Page 329 -->
![Commercial Paper Memorandum](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Commercial+Paper+Memorandum)

**Prospective investors should therefore base their investment decision primarily on the credit of the Bank, rather than on that of SMUD.**

BofA Securities, Inc., as dealer of the Notes (the “Dealer”) has provided the following sentence for inclusion in this Commercial Paper Memorandum. The Dealer has reviewed the information in this Commercial Paper Memorandum in accordance with, and as part of, its responsibilities to investors under the federal securities law as applied to the facts and circumstances of this transaction, but the Dealer does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information.

**THE COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES**

SMUD is issuing the Notes pursuant to (a) Articles 6a and 6b of Chapter 6 of the Act (California Public Utilities Code Section 12850 et seq.), (b) Chapter 7.5 of the Act (California Public Utilities Code Section 13371 et seq.) and (c) Article 11 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code (California Government Code Section 53580 et seq.). Resolution No. 19-02-02 of SMUD, adopted on February 21, 2019, as supplemented and amended by Resolution No. 22-02-06 of SMUD, adopted on February 17, 2022, and by Resolution No. 24-02-[ ] of SMUD, adopted on February 15, 2024 (collectively, the “Resolution”), provides that Notes may be outstanding in an aggregate principal amount that does not exceed $250,000,000. The proceeds of the Notes may be used by SMUD to finance or refinance capital improvements, certain costs associated with the purchase of fuel, facilities design, site preparation, the acquisition of equipment, and to pay maturing Notes.

The Notes are secured by a pledge of Available Revenues and supported by the Letter of Credit. The Letter of Credit has been issued pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement. Available Revenues of SMUD are composed of net revenues of SMUD after payment of operating, maintenance, and purchased power expenses, Rate Stabilization Fund deposits, and debt service and reserves on SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds and Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds, all as provided in the Resolution.

The Notes will be issued as book-entry obligations evidenced by a master note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. The Notes may be issued in denominations of $100,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $100,000, with interest payable at maturity, and shall mature on such dates as SMUD may establish, provided that no Note shall mature more than 270 days from the date of issuance thereof. Subseries M-1 Notes shall bear interest on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year, as applicable, and the actual number of days elapsed and Subseries M-2 Notes shall bear interest on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. The Notes are payable at the principal office of U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association (the “Depositary”).

Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement relating to the Notes, dated February 28, 2019 (the “Depositary Agreement”), between SMUD and the Depositary, the Depositary is not permitted to authenticate and deliver any Note if, immediately after the authentication and delivery thereof, the aggregate face amount of the Outstanding Notes plus the maximum amount of interest which may accrue thereon would exceed the aggregate Letter of Credit Stated Amount.

**BANK CREDIT ARRANGEMENT**

**Stated Amount and Term of the Letter of Credit.** Pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement, the Bank has issued to the Depositary the Letter of Credit in the aggregate maximum stated amount of $256,164,384 (consisting of $250,000,000 principal plus 90 days interest calculated at a rate of 10% per annum assuming a 365-day year) as reduced and reinstated from time to time in accordance with terms of the Letter of Credit (the “Letter of Credit Stated Amount”). The Letter of Credit’s stated expiration date is February [__], 20[__], unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, and unless such expiration date is extended by the Bank in accordance with the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.

**Drawings under the Letter of Credit.** The Depositary is authorized to make drawings under the Letter of Credit in accordance with its terms. If demand for payment under the Letter of Credit is properly presented as provided therein and in conformity with the requirements thereof, payment shall be made by the Bank to the Depositary, in immediately available funds, at such times as provided in and in accordance with the provisions of the Letter of Credit. All payments made by the Bank under the Letter of Credit shall be made with the Bank’s own funds.

If for any reason the Bank fails to honor a properly presented and conforming drawing under the Letter of Credit, SMUD cannot provide any assurance that it will have sufficient funds on hand and available to make such payment of principal and/or interest on the Notes supported by the Letter of Credit or to make such payments in a timely manner. Prospective investors should therefore base their investment decision primarily on the credit of the Bank, rather than on that of SMUD.

**Reimbursement of Drawings under the Letter of Credit.** Drawings made under the Letter of Credit to pay interest due on the Notes are required to be reimbursed by SMUD on the date of such drawing. Drawings made under the Letter of Credit to pay the principal of the Notes if not reimbursed by SMUD in full on the date of such drawing will, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions of the Reimbursement Agreement, automatically convert to and constitute and advance made by the Bank to SMUD (an “Advance”) to be paid in installments on (a) the first business day to occur on or after the six (6) month anniversary of the date the related Advance is made and the first business day of each sixth (6th) calendar month occurring thereafter prior to the related Amortization End Date and (b) the related Amortization End Date. The “Amortization End Date” means, with respect to any Advance, the earliest to occur of: (i) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date on which the related Advance was made, (ii) the date on which an Alternate Letter of Credit (defined herein) becomes effective in substitution of the Letter of Credit with respect to the Notes, and (iii) the date on which the Letter of Credit Stated Amount is permanently reduced to zero or the Letter of Credit is otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms prior to its stated expiration date.

![Events of Default under the Reimbursement Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Events+of+Default+under+the+Reimbursement+Agreement)

**Events of Default under the Reimbursement Agreement.** The Reimbursement Agreement contains certain events of default by SMUD, including, but not limited to, an event of default under the Program Documents, the Master Bond Resolution or the Subordinate Bond Resolution (each as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement), a failure by SMUD to reimburse the Bank for a drawing under the Letter of Credit when due under the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement or a payment default or certain other defaults with respect to certain other obligations of SMUD, subject to such grace periods as are provided for in the Reimbursement Agreement, material misrepresentation or breach of covenant by SMUD, subject to such grace periods as are provided for in the Reimbursement Agreement, voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency of SMUD, or the downgrade by any Rating Agency (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) of its long-term unenhanced rating with respect to any Bonds (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) to a level below “Baa3” (or its equivalent) in the case of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., “BBB-” (or its equivalent) in the case of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services or “BBB-” (or its equivalent) in the case of Fitch, Inc.

**Remedies under the Reimbursement Agreement.** Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under the Reimbursement Agreement, the Bank may, but is not obligated to (i) declare all Obligations (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) to be immediately due and payable, (ii) deliver to the Depositary a “No-Issuance Notice” under the terms of the Letter of Credit stating the amount to the extent then outstanding Notes supported by the Letter of Credit and/or terminate the Letter of Credit Stated Amount as the then outstanding Notes are paid, (iii) issue the “Final Drawing Notice” to the Depositary, the effect of which shall be to cause the termination of the Letter of Credit to occur on the 15th day after the date of receipt thereof by the Depositary or (iv) pursue such other remedies as are available to it at law or in equity.

Upon the issuance of a Final Drawing Notice by the Bank, the Depositary is required to draw upon the Letter of Credit in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes then outstanding as the same become due.

**ALTERNATE LETTER OF CREDIT**

Pursuant to the terms of the Resolution, SMUD may elect to replace the Letter of Credit with one or more letters of credit issued by a commercial bank or financial institution (or a syndicate of such institutions acting jointly or severally), delivered to the Depositary pursuant to the Depositary Agreement and conforming to the requirements of the Resolution (the “Alternate Letter of Credit”). SMUD shall give written notice of its intention to exercise such election to the Depositary, not fewer than ten (10) days prior to the proposed date upon which an Alternate Letter of Credit is to become effective (the “Substitution Date”). No substitution of an Alternate Letter of Credit for the Letter of Credit shall occur unless all Notes outstanding on the Substitution Date are either (1) paid from the proceeds of the Notes issued on the Substitution Date or (2) paid from the proceeds of a drawing under the Letter of Credit and cancelled.

THE DEALER

SMUD has appointed BofA Securities, Inc. (the “Dealer”) as a dealer for SMUD in connection with the offering, issuance and sale of the Notes pursuant to a Dealer Agreement, dated February 28, 2019, as amended (the “Dealer Agreement”), between SMUD and the Dealer. SMUD agrees to pay to the Dealer a fee in an amount as set forth in the Dealer Agreement.

The Dealer Agreement may be terminated by the Dealer or SMUD at any time on written notice given no less than ten (10) business days prior to such termination date; provided, however, that upon the mutual agreement, such written notice may be given fewer than ten (10) business days prior to such termination date.

The Dealer, in its individual capacity, may in good faith buy, sell, own, hold and deal in any of the Notes, including, without limitation, any Notes offered and sold by the Dealer pursuant to the Dealer Agreement, and may join in any action which any owner of the Notes may be entitled to take with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity under such Agreement. The Dealer may sell any of the Notes in the secondary market at prices above or below par, at any time. The Dealer, however, is not obligated to purchase any Notes for its own account at any time. The Dealer, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, and its affiliates may also engage in or be interested in any financial or other transaction with SMUD and may act as depositary, account party, or agent for any committee or body of owners of the Notes or other obligations of SMUD as freely as if it did not act in any capacity under the Dealer Agreement.

The Dealer and its affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Under certain circumstances, the Dealer and its affiliates may have certain creditor and/or other rights against SMUD in connection with such activities. In the various course of their various business.

activities, the Dealer and its affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of SMUD (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with SMUD. The Dealer and its affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments.

The Dealer, which is serving as the dealer for the Notes, and the Bank, which is providing the Letter of Credit for the Notes, are affiliates. The activities of the Dealer and the Bank are unrelated to and independent of each other. By purchasing a Note, the purchaser thereof consents to any conflict of interest that could exist by reason of the different capacities in which the Dealer, the Bank and any other potential affiliate provides services in connection with the Notes.

TAX MATTERS

Subseries M-1 Notes

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, bond counsel to SMUD (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings, and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and will be exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes will not be a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations will not be excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. The amount treated as interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes and excluded from gross income will depend upon the taxpayer’s election under Internal Revenue Notice 94-84. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Subseries M-1 Notes. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in Appendix B.

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Subseries M-1 Notes. SMUD has made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these
<!-- Page 335 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page) 

representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the Subseries M-1 Notes. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken) or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the Subseries M-1 Notes may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the Subseries M-1 Notes. Accordingly, the opinion of Bond Counsel is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters.

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and will be exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of amounts treated as interest on, the Subseries M-1 Notes may otherwise affect a beneficial owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. The nature and extent of these other tax consequences will depend upon the particular tax status of the beneficial owner or the beneficial owner’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may cause interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes to be subject, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent beneficial owners from realizing the full tax benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals or clarification of the Code or court decisions may affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the Subseries M-1 Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Subseries M-1 Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, and regarding the impact of future legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the Subseries M-1 Notes for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of SMUD, or about the effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. SMUD has covenanted, however, to comply with the requirements of the Code.

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the Subseries M-1 Notes ends with the delivery of its opinion, and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend SMUD or the beneficial owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the Subseries M-1 Notes in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, beneficial owners would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in connection with an audit examination of tax-exempt obligations is
<!-- Page 336 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Payments on the Subseries M-1 Notes generally will be subject to U.S. information reporting and possibly to “backup withholding.” Under Section 3406 of the Code and applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, a non-corporate beneficial owner of Subseries M-1 Notes may be subject to backup withholding with respect to “reportable payments,” which include interest paid on the Subseries M-1 Notes and the gross proceeds of a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of the Subseries M-1 Notes. The payor will be required to deduct and withhold the prescribed amounts if (i) the payee fails to furnish a U.S. taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the payor in the manner required, (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect, (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the Code or (iv) the payee fails to certify under penalty of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding under Section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Code. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a beneficial owner’s federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Certain beneficial owners (including among others, corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations) are not subject to backup withholding. The failure to comply with the backup withholding rules may result in the imposition of penalties by the IRS.

### Subseries M-2 Notes

**State of California Income Tax Considerations.** In the opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Subseries M-2 Notes is exempt from State of California personal income taxes.

**Certain United States Federal Tax Considerations.** Interest on the Subseries M-2 Notes is not excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.

Prospective investors that are not individuals or regular C corporations who are U.S. persons purchasing the Subseries M-2 Notes for investment should consult their own tax advisors as to any tax consequences to them from the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Subseries M-2 Notes.

### RATINGS

Each rating below reflects only the view of the ratings service issuing such rating and is not a recommendation by such rating services to purchase, sell or hold the obligations to which such rating applies or as to the market price or suitability of such obligations for a particular investor. An explanation of the significance of a rating may be obtained from the ratings service issuing such rating. There is no assurance that any rating will continue for any period of time or

### DTC’S BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

Each subseries of the Notes will be evidenced by a single master note (each a “Master Note” and, collectively, the “Master Notes”) registered in the name of a nominee of DTC. The Master Notes will be deposited with the Depositary as custodian for DTC. DTC will record, by appropriate entries on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the amounts payable in respect of the Notes. Payments by DTC participants to purchasers for whom a DTC participant is acting as agent in respect of Notes will be governed by the standing instructions and customary practices under which securities are held at DTC through DTC participants.

### LITIGATION

There is no litigation now pending or, to the knowledge of SMUD, threatened against SMUD which restrains or enjoins the issuance or delivery of the Notes or the use of the proceeds of the Notes or which questions or contests the validity of the Notes or the proceedings and authority under which they are to be issued, executed and delivered. To the knowledge of SMUD, neither the creation, organization, nor existence of SMUD, nor the title of the present members or other officials of SMUD to their respective offices, is being currently contested or questioned.

### CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS

The validity of the Notes and certain other legal matters are subject to the approving opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD. A complete copy of the proposed form of Bond Counsel opinion is contained in Appendix B. Bond Counsel undertakes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of this Commercial Paper Memorandum. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the Bank by Chapman and Cutler LLP.

The Continuing Disclosure Agreements may be terminated or amended pursuant to their respective terms without the necessity of obtaining the consent of any holders of the Notes. The Continuing Disclosure Agreements are solely for the benefit of the holders of the related debt issues and the holders of the Notes have no right to enforce the provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Agreements. However, holders and potential purchasers of the Notes may access such information through EMMA, so long as SMUD is required to make such filings.

**PROPOSED FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL**

[Closing Date]  
Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Sacramento, California  

Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Commercial Paper Notes, Series M  
(Final Opinion)  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) in connection with the authorization of the issuance of up to $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount (at any time Outstanding) of commercial paper notes by SMUD, pursuant to Resolution No. 19-02-02, adopted by SMUD on February 21, 2019, as supplemented by Resolution No. 22-02-06, adopted by SMUD on February 17, 2022, and by Resolution No. 24-02-[__], adopted by SMUD on February 15, 2024 (collectively, the “Resolution”), and designated Sacramento Municipal Utility District Commercial Paper Notes, Subseries M-1 (the “Subseries M-1 Notes”) and Subseries M-2 (the “Subseries M-2 Notes” and, together with the Subseries M-1 Notes, the “Notes”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Resolution; the Tax Certificate of SMUD, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”); the Depositary Agreement, dated February 28, 2019 (the “Depositary Agreement”), between SMUD and the Depositary; an opinion of counsel to SMUD; certificates of SMUD, the Depositary and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof before or after Notes are issued. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted to occur or any other matters come to our attention after the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters. We disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures provided to us and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than SMUD. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy (as of the date hereof and as of each date of issuance from time to time of the Notes) of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinion, referred to in the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly retroactive to the date on  

B-1
<!-- Page 342 -->

which the first Subseries M-1 Notes were issued. We call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Notes, the Resolution and the Tax Certificate and their enforceability may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against governmental entities such as SMUD in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the property described in or subject to the lien of the Resolution or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein of, or the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such property. Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Commercial Paper Memorandum or other offering material relating to the Notes and express no view with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1. The Resolution has been duly adopted by SMUD and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of SMUD.

2. The Notes, when duly issued from time to time in the form authorized by and otherwise in compliance with the Resolution, executed by an Authorized Officer and authenticated by the Depositary against payment therefor, will constitute the valid and binding limited obligations of SMUD.

3. Interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes, when issued in accordance with the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amount treated as interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes and excluded from gross income will depend on the taxpayer’s election under Internal Revenue Service Notice 94-84. Interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. We observe that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Interest on the Notes, when issued in accordance with the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. We observe that interest on the Subseries M-2 Notes is not excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Notes.

Faithfully yours,
