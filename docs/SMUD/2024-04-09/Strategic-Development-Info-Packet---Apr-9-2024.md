# Mike Gravely
**California Energy Commission (CEC)**  
**Team Lead and Senior Electrical Engineer for the Energy Systems Research Branch**

Mike Gravely is the Energy Storage Team Lead and Senior Electrical Engineer for the Energy Systems Research Branch at the California Energy Commission. His team is managing over $400 million in microgrid, energy storage and related energy research and demonstration projects. In this role, he oversees the full spectrum of research activities to improve the California Electric Grid including assessing future energy storage needs for California and addressing the grid related issues associated with integrating higher concentrations of renewables. In 2020, the Energy Commission awarded over $100 million in state funds and vendor cost-share investments to over 25 new grants to complete research and demonstration projects with new and emerging energy storage technologies. One key area of this research is focused on understanding the capability and value of long duration energy storage solutions (from 10 hours to 100+ hours) to assist California in transitioning to the goal of 100 percent zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045. His team received $330M in funding in the FY 2022/2023 and the 2023/2024 State Budget for the fielding of non-lithium-ion long duration energy storage (LDES) technologies. This funding represents the largest investment in field demonstrations for the commercialization advancement of emerging non-lithium-ion LDES in the Nation. Currently, the CEC is investing in six different non-Lithium-Ion technologies in field demonstrations with durations from 8 hours to 100 hours and power rating of up to 10 MWs and energy rating up to 500 MWHs. Most of these demonstrations are expected to be operating in 2024 and 2025.

Mike Gravely has a BSEE from the Virginia Military Institute and an MSEE from California State University at Sacramento. Prior to the Energy Commission, Mike served in executive positions in the Federal Government and private industry including addressing the business challenges of a startup energy storage company. Mike also serves as the Military Advisor and Energy Storage Technology Advisor to Chair Hochschild of the California Energy Commission.
