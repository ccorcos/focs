# Zero Carbon Plan and Program Context
- My Energy Optimizer Partner + Virtual Power Plant (VPP) program implemented in mid-2023 with Swell as the program administrator and aggregator  
  ➢ Tesla batteries are currently the only Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) with the Open Automated Demand Response protocols and Application Program Interface (ADR and API) capabilities to qualify for VPP participation and events  
  ➢ Addition of other battery OEMs is on the roadmap for the program and Swell over the coming year  
- ZCP trajectory estimated ~4,000 batteries in market by 2024  
  ➢ Sacramento market is behind with higher than anticipated battery and installation costs combined with current high interest/financing rates/terms  
- Participation in VPP program requires enrollment on S&SR  
  ➢ Currently a difficult financial proposition for existing Net Energy Metering (NEM) customers  
  ➢ In contrast there are ~12,000+ solar customers on Solar & Storage Rate (S&SR) who do not have batteries

![Battery Storage Acceleration Pathways](https://example.com/image.png)

# Battery Storage Acceleration Pathways

1. **Single Family: My Energy Optimizer Partner+ Virtual Power Plant (VPP) Program Expansion**
   - Engage with Tesla as the primary market shareholder and the battery system supported by Swell (program administrator and aggregator)
     - Negotiate bulk purchase with fixed/standardized pricing for batteries
     - Update and coordinate procurement, distribution, and deployment model
     - Increase program incentives (at least in the short term) in response to high RA market prices
     - Allow incentives for up to 2 batteries per site
     - Expand and support local installer network with standardized application through commissioning processes

# Battery Storage Acceleration Pathways

## 2. Multi-Family Program Development & Deployment
- Accelerate and complete battery installation project at Chesapeake Commons (Wasatch property) with Sonnen
  - Phase 1 deployment with 100 batteries – 700kW total, 2.1MWh
  - Batteries in front of meter, SMUD owned and managed
  - SMUD to have full dispatch control of resource via DERMS/Itron-DERO
  - Primary contract is with Wasatch, but batteries (and solar) tied to individual units providing bill benefits & reliability
  - Test ability to unload service transformers and provide bulk RA capacity value

# Battery Storage/VPP Additional Considerations

- Further expansion and acceleration of residential storage is a key element of the GRIP TA3 grant application
  - Potential for further funding to install ~10,000 batteries between 2025 and 2029 as a key element of the 2030 ZCP
  - Explore additional or alternative cost and ownership models based on outcomes from current expansion efforts
  - Can provide significant support for battery installations in DACs

- Expansion of Sonnen/Wasatch project and deployment model to additional multi-family properties

- Development and implementation of a battery storage VPP option for commercial customer applications
