The document outlines the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) Board Strategic Development Committee and Special Board of Directors Meeting focused on the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan, emphasizing the Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) and Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) Strategy.

### Key Updates and Reports:

- **Energy Storage Systems Update**:
  - SMUD partnered with ESS in September 2022 for a phased project targeting 4 Megawatts (MW) and over 24 Megawatt-hours (MWh) of Long Duration Energy Storage.
  - Six Energy Warehouses installed at the Hedge Power Academy site provide approximately 0.5 MW and 2.5 MWh of storage capacity. Site acceptance testing and troubleshooting are ongoing, with established connections for visibility and control with Distribution System Operations (DSO).
  - The Energy Center (Phase 1b) will add approximately 1.8 MW and 13 MWh to the existing interconnection, with Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) procurement following successful commissioning of the Energy Warehouses.

- **McClellan Battery Energy Storage System**:
  - A 75 MW x 4-hour BESS project, totaling 300 MWh, will connect to two substations (North and South Parcel) and is expected to achieve Commercial Operations by 2026/2027. This project is essential for grid stability and managing peak demand.

- **Customer-Sited Battery Energy Storage Systems**:
  - As of March 2024, there are 1,640 residential solar and battery storage customers with a total of 2,190 batteries providing 10.7 MW of storage capacity. Tesla batteries account for 1,273 customers and 6.4 MW, while non-Tesla batteries account for 917 customers and 4.3 MW. SMUD promotes battery storage to enhance customer energy independence and resilience.

- **Zero Carbon Plan Context**:
  - The My Energy Optimizer Partner and Virtual Power Plant program, launched in mid-2023, currently supports only Tesla batteries. The goal is to have approximately 4,000 batteries in the market by 2024. However, high battery and installation costs, along with elevated interest and financing rates, hinder market growth, raising concerns about accessibility and affordability.

- **Battery Storage Acceleration Pathways**:
  - Plans include expanding the Virtual Power Plant program to negotiate bulk purchases with standardized pricing for batteries. The Chesapeake Commons project will deploy 100 batteries with a total capacity of 700 kW and 2.1 MWh, providing bill benefits and reliability to individual units while allowing SMUD full dispatch control.

- **California Energy Commission Activities**:
  - The [California Energy Commission (CEC)](https://www.energy.ca.gov/) invested over $100 million in energy storage research in 2020 and approved funding of $140 million for FY 2022-2023 and $190 million for FY 2023-2024 for LDES technologies. The CEC is advancing six non-lithium-ion technologies, including zinc hybrid and iron flow batteries, with field demonstrations expected by 2024 and 2025.

### Community Concerns:
- Community members expressed concerns about the affordability of battery storage systems and the need for inclusive programs for low-income households. They urged SMUD to explore additional funding opportunities for battery installations in Disadvantaged Communities (DACs) to ensure equitable distribution of Zero Carbon Plan benefits.

The document highlights SMUD's strategic initiatives and progress toward the Zero Carbon Plan through various energy storage projects and partnerships while addressing community concerns regarding accessibility and affordability of energy solutions.
