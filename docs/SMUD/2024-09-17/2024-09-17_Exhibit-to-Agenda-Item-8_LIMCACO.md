# July 2024 Energy Sources

- Hydro generation was 31% lower than budget in July, and 6% lower than budget year-to-date due to increased purchased power due to favorable market prices.

- Thermal plants & other generation was 16% lower than budget in July, and 12% lower year-to-date due to unplanned plant outage and increased purchased power.

- Net purchased power was 96% higher than budget in July, and 44% higher year-to-date primarily due to favorable market prices leading to decreased thermal generation and hydro generation.
