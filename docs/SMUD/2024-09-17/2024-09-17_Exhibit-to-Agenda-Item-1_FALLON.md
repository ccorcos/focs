**Background**

Siemens is our current EMS vendor and has been a SMUD strategic partner for over 35 years

- Critical platform used for real-time monitoring and operations of SMUD's transmission, generation, gas pipeline systems
- Minimizes operational cost to participate in CAISO based programs such as the Western Energy Imbalance Market (WEIM), Extended-Day Ahead Market (EDAM), and Reliability Coordinator (RC) programs
- No other vendors can upgrade our existing EMS due to the proprietary nature of the software, Siemens EMS is a sole source contract
