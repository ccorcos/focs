# Kaiser Medical benefits background

- Medical cost trends projected to increase 8.0 – 8.5%*
- Utilization/Claims primary influencer of premiums. Other factors now include:
  - Inflationary Impacts on Healthcare Provider Costs
  - Increasing cost of pharmaceuticals
  - Residual increase of services and treatments from pandemic
- Offering an HMO Low and HMO High
- Each year Kaiser establishes a not to exceed/not below percentage amount for their client groups. For 2025 that amount has been set at -5% to 20% (cap).
- Utilization is the primary factor Kaiser uses to determine rates.
- Kaiser uses a 12-month utilization period for rate calculations (other insurers use 18-24 months)
