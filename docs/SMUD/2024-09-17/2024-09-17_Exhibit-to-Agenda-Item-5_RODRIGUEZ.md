![Request 1: Background](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=Request+1%3A+Background)

- Employees, including SMUD's Parents Employee Resource Group, have asked for a Paid Family Leave benefit (similar to the State's program).
- SMUD's current self-funded Short-Term (adopted in 1992) & Long-Term (adopted in 1975) Disability Insurance plans needed updating and enhancements to plan design parameters.
- SMUD staff looked holistically at how to modernize these benefit offerings to meet the diverse needs of our employees in a fiscally responsible way.
- Joining Public Risk Innovation, Solutions, and Management (PRISM) Joint Powers Authority would give SMUD access to these new and improved benefits and the opportunity to purchase other employee benefits and other insurance policies and contracts.
