**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and award a Sole Source contract to Siemens Industry, Inc. (“Siemens”) for the upgrade of their proprietary Energy Management System (“EMS”) for the term September 20, 2024, through December 31, 2026, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $7 million.

**Summary:**  
The EMS is critical to the real-time operations of SMUD's transmission, generation, distribution, gas scheduling, and commodity settlement systems. SMUD Transmission Planning and Operations is currently using the Siemens Spectrum Power 7, v2.2 EMS that was implemented in 2019. The EMS is also used to perform the Balancing Authority operations for the Balancing Authority of Northern California (“BANC”) and participation in the Western Energy Imbalance Market. The EMS was originally scheduled for an upgrade in 2026, but with projects coming online in support of the Zero Carbon Plan (ZCP), it is critical to expedite the timeline for the EMS upgrade project. This will ensure the hardware, software, and other third-party products are refreshed, and the EMS that supports both SMUD’s and BANC’s grid management and operations are current on vendor supported products. As this software is proprietary, Siemens is the only vendor with the access required to upgrade the EMS. The Board previously approved a contract with Siemens for these services in January 2024 for a not-to-exceed amount of $6 million, but the final negotiated contract includes modified and additional services as well as updated pricing.

**Recommendation:**  
Award a Sole Source contract to:  
Siemens Industry, Inc.  
10900 Wayzata Blvd., Ste. 400  
Minnetonka, MN 55305  

**Board Policy:**  
(Board-Staff Linkage BL-8, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement; Strategic Direction SD-4, Reliability; Strategic Direction SD-7, Environmental Leadership)  

**Benefits:**  
The upgrade will provide minimized operational costs, new features and functionality to improve real-time monitoring and control of the grid and generation assets by Transmission Planning and Operations and will allow for a refresh of all hardware and third-party software before they are outdated and unsupported.

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
$7,000,000; Budgeted for 2024-2026 by Transmission Planning and Operations.

**Alternatives:**  
Issue a competitive solicitation to replace the entire EMS. This alternative is cost and resource prohibitive, introduces unnecessary risk to operations, and would delay integrating ZCP requirements into the system.

**Affected Parties:**  
Transmission Planning and Operations, Procurement, Warehouse and Fleet, and Siemens.

**Coordination:**  
Siemens, Energy Delivery & Operations, and Procurement, Warehouse, and Fleet.

**Presenter:**  
Casey Fallon, Director, Procurement, Warehouse & Fleet

**DATE SENT**  
08/22/24  

**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:**  
Discuss approval of proposed revisions to Energy Risk Management and Energy Trading Standards under Board-Staff Linkage BL-12, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Transactions Involving Transmission and Wholesale Energy, Fuel, and Environmental Attributes to address federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) Regulations.  

**Summary:**  
Under Board-Staff Linkage BL-12, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Transactions Involving Transmission and Wholesale Energy, Fuel, and Environmental Attributes, the Energy Risk Management and Energy Trading Standards delegate authority to the CEO to negotiate and execute power purchase agreements (PPAs) that have terms greater than three (3) years. Title II of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) requires utilities to interconnect and also purchase energy and capacity from qualifying facilities (QFs) at the utility’s avoided cost. The Board’s existing authority regarding PURPA PPAs with terms greater than three (3) years is a predetermined administrative function since the Board does not have discretion and would be required to approve a PURPA PPA for SMUD to maintain compliance with federal law. The proposed revision delegates authority to the CEO to negotiate and execute PURPA PPAs with no term limit, as long as the PPAs are consistent with federal PURPA regulations, and the contract price does not exceed SMUD’s avoided cost.  

**Board Policy:**  
(Board-Staff Linkage BL-12, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Transactions Involving Transmission and Wholesale Energy, Fuel, and Environmental Attributes)  

**Benefits:**  
Facilitate compliance with PURPA requirements; ensure PPA contract price for QF projects do not exceed our avoided costs; efficient PPA contract process for small generation projects.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
N/A  

**Alternatives:**  
Maintain existing delegation and seek Board approval for individual PURPA PPAs with terms of more than 3 years (to maintain compliance with PURPA, the Board’s approval is a perfunctory, administrative function); provide advance notice to Board before executing PURPA PPAs; report to Board after execution of PURPA PPAs.

# ENERGY RISK MANAGEMENT AND ENERGY TRADING STANDARDS  
## SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT  

### PURPOSE  
The wholesale energy markets are exposed to numerous risks including, but not limited to, market price risk, supply risk, credit risk and regulatory risk. The purpose of the Energy Risk Management and Energy Trading Standards (the “Standards”) is to establish protocols for prudent risk mitigation and management.  

### SCOPE  
The Standards apply to:  
- The operation of SMUD-owned or controlled generation, transmission, natural gas and other fuel reserves and pipeline assets;  
- Contracts for and related to the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity, electric capacity and storage, natural gas and clean and emissions-free fuel, and environmental products;  
- Contracts for and related to transmission, natural gas and clean or emissions-free fuel transportation, and storage; and  
- Contracts for and related to financially hedging or mitigating risks associated with wholesale electricity, electric capacity and natural gas and other fuel prices, supplies and markets.  

### PRIORITIES  
The Chief Executive Officer/General Manager (CEO/GM) implement the Standards in accordance with Board policies and with the following priorities, listed in order of importance:  

**Priority 1.** Manage resource mix to comply with Board Strategic Direction (SD-4) Reliability.  

**Priority 2.** Minimize net commodity energy purchase costs while operating within the targets established in Board Strategic Direction (SD-3) Access to Credit Markets.

# DRAFT
## ENERGY RISK MANAGEMENT AND ENERGY TRADING STANDARDS  
### SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT  

### PURPOSE  
The wholesale energy markets are exposed to numerous risks including, but not limited to, market price risk, supply risk, credit risk and regulatory risk. The purpose of the Energy Risk Management and Energy Trading Standards (the “Standards”) is to establish protocols for prudent risk mitigation and management.  

### SCOPE  
The Standards apply to:  
- The operation of SMUD-owned or controlled generation, transmission, natural gas and other fuel reserves and pipeline assets;  
- Contracts for and related to the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity, electric capacity and storage, natural gas and clean and emissions-free fuel, and environmental products;  
- Contracts for and related to transmission, natural gas and clean or emissions-free fuel transportation, and storage; and  
- Contracts for and related to financially hedging or mitigating risks associated with wholesale electricity, electric capacity and natural gas and other fuel prices, supplies and markets.  

### PRIORITIES  
The Chief Executive Officer/General Manager (CEO/GM) implement the Standards in accordance with Board policies and with the following priorities, listed in order of importance:  

**Priority 1.** Manage resource mix to comply with Board Strategic Direction (SD-4) Reliability.  

**Priority 2.** Minimize net commodity energy purchase costs while operating within the targets established in Board Strategic Direction (SD-3) Access to Credit Markets.  

**Priority 3.** Optimize SMUD-owned or controlled assets, including but not limited to, generation, transmission, fuel reserves, pipeline assets, fuel storage and contract resources to create additional value for SMUD and its customers, while complying with Board policies and all applicable laws and regulations.

## DIVERSIFICATION AND PORTFOLIO MIX

SMUD will maintain a diverse portfolio of generation, transmission, fuel-related assets and contracts to reasonably mitigate risk and to support its clean energy goals. Risks associated with wholesale contracts will be mitigated through diversified terms and conditions, contract periods and durations, delivery points, counter-parties, and product types.

## PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES

The CEO/GM will develop and maintain written procedures to implement the Standards and will ensure that appropriate internal controls and limits are in place to ensure compliance with Board policies, the Standards and applicable laws and regulations. Consistent with Board policies and the Standards, the CEO/GM will analyze and implement risk mitigation measures, as appropriate.

Procurement  

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and award a contract to United Health Care Insurance Company (“United HealthCare”) to provide administration of SMUD’s Medical Benefits Plan for an initial three-year period from January 1, 2025, to December 31, 2027, with two optional one-year extensions, for a contract total not-to-exceed amount of $275 million.  

**Summary:**  
This was a two-step solution process including request for qualifications initially, followed by a request for proposal phase. The Request for Qualifications (RFQ) was issued in December 2023 to qualify firms to participate in the Request for Proposals (RFP) for administration of SMUD’s Medical Benefits Plan. With the assistance of Aon Consultants (“Aon”), SMUD Procurement and Aon Strategies issued the RFQ with an extensive pass/fail requirements. SMUD received three proposals for said RFQ and all three respondents qualified for the subsequent RFP. With the assistance of Aon and work groups throughout SMUD, the evaluation of the RFP responses was completed. It was determined that United HealthCare was the highest evaluated proposer and the only proposer who could provide all the services requested for our active employees and retirees. The proposal from United HealthCare included: (1) no network disruption for active employees and retirees (Pre and Post-65); (2) no disruption in medical groups (in greater Sacramento region): Sutter Medical Group, Brown & Toland, Dignity Health/Mercy Medical Group, UC Davis Medical Group, and Hill’s Physicians; (3) similar plan design options and offerings including High Deductible Health Plan with Health Savings Account (HSA) (HDP), Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) (closed plan), and Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) (High and Low) plans for active employees, HMO High and PPO plans for our Pre-65 early retirees and Medicare Advantage Plan for our post-65 retirees; and (4) $200,000 renewable implementation credit with no restrictions of use. The United HealthCare proposal includes a 2nd year, 2026, rate cap of 8.9% for HMO plans, 13.4% for PPO/HDHP plans. Offered a 3rd year, 2027, benefit-cost ratio (BCR) for HMO plans, no rate cap for PPO/HDHP plans. Offered a 2026 and 2027 maximum rate increase of $75 PMPM for Medicare Advantage Plans. The Best and Final Offer, United HealthCare provided an overall additional decrease of $145,000, or -0.45% for combined Active, Retiree, and Medicare Plans. This is down from an increase of 2.76%. The total savings for the awards is $1,173,000.  

**Recommendation:**  
Award to the Highest Evaluated Responsive Proposer.  

**Award to:**  
United Health Care Insurance Company

**Board Policy:**  
Board-Staff Linkage BL-8, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement; Procurement. Strategic Direction SD-3, Access to Credit Markets: SMUD staff negotiated best price and terms with medical providers in consideration of the long-term revenue requirements, debt, and financial risk to SMUD. Strategic Direction SD-8, Employee Relations. Providing medical benefits to employees supports SMUD’s goal of an inclusive workplace that engages and inspires employees to commit to SMUD’s purpose, vision, and values.

**Benefits:**  
To provide quality medical benefits to eligible SMUD employees, retirees, and eligible dependents.

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
$275,000,000; Budgeted for 2025-2029 by People Services & Strategies

**Alternatives:**  
Not award, which would jeopardize SMUD’s ability to provide the required employee health benefits and impact employee’s access to health care. Extend the current contract, with United HealthCare, for an additional year and could result in higher premiums. Additionally remarketing this RFP could take up to a year and result in the same outcome.

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Approve contract change to Contract No. 4500043215 with Kaiser Permanente approving 2025 medical insurance premium rates and extending the contract by one year for the period January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025. The total estimated cost for 2025, based on the current enrollment population, is $34.5 million.  

**Summary:**  
Kaiser Permanente presented SMUD with a renewal increase for the 2025 plan year of 20% for active employee, pre-65 retiree and Medicare Advantage medical plans. The percentage increase is determined by a 12-month utilization period where there were significant increases due to lag of individuals returning to address medical conditions following the pandemic, and an increase in serious illnesses and associated pharmaceutical costs. We anticipate rates being more in line with lower past trends and decreasing next year based on the last six months of utilization data. The 20% increase is based on the difference in the aggregated total cost of premiums for active employees and retirees (and dependents) enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente plans from 2023 to 2024. Based on these rates and current enrollment, the total cost for 2025 medical benefit plans is projected at $34.5 million.  

Note: The estimated costs above will vary based on 2025 employee/retiree Open Enrollment selections and SMUD population.  

**Board Policy:**  
**(Number & Title)**  
Strategic Direction SD-3, Access to Credit Markets. SMUD staff negotiated best price and terms with medical providers in consideration of the long-term revenue requirements, debt, and financial risk to SMUD.

**Benefits:**  
Provide quality medical benefits to eligible SMUD employees, retirees, and eligible dependents.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
Assuming current enrollment, SMUD’s share of cost is projected at $34.5 million (after employee/retiree contributions).  

**Alternatives:**  
Not accepting the proposed rate increases would jeopardize SMUD’s ability to provide the required employee health benefits and impact employees’ access to health care and out of compliance with current labor Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs).

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager (CEO/GM), or his delegate, on behalf of Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) to join, terminate, and rejoin Public Risk Innovation, Solutions, and Management (PRISM) for the placement or cancellation of employee benefits and other insurance policies or contracts in an amount not to exceed $3 million each in support of SMUD’s Paid Family Leave, Short-Term Disability and Long-Term Disability benefits and potential future employee benefits and other insurance needs, and to execute all agreements and documents necessary in connection with the placement or cancellation of the insurance policies or contracts.  

**Summary:**  
Staff conducted market research regarding current employee benefits such as paid family leave, short-term disability leave, and long-term disability leave and determined that modifications to SMUD’s employee benefits package would support the Board’s directive with regard to employee attraction and retention. Previously, some of these benefits have been offered through self-funded insurance with voluntary enrollment by employees. In conjunction with SMUD’s review of insurance and pooling options, SMUD has determined that joining PRISM would be beneficial to SMUD.  

PRISM, formerly known as CSAC Excess Insurance Authority, was formed under the sponsorship of the County Supervisors Association of California dba California State Association of Counties to find cost effective insurance solutions and risk management services and is a member directed risk sharing pool. PRISM’s membership includes 95 percent of California counties, 70 percent of California cities, and 10 percent of California educational organizations, special districts, housing authorities, fire districts, and 27 Joint Powers Authorities.  

Accordingly, staff seeks approval for the CEO/GM, or his delegate, to execute all documents necessary for SMUD to join, terminate, and/or rejoin PRISM for the placement or cancellation of employee benefits insurance policies and contracts in an amount not to exceed $3 million each.  

**Board Policy (Number & Title):**  
Strategic Direction SD-8, Employee Relations. Providing new Paid Family Leave insurance as well as improved Short-Term and Long-Term insurance supports SMUD’s commitment to attract and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce and promotes an inclusive workplace that engages and inspires employees to commit to SMUD’s purpose, vision and values.  

**Benefits:**  
To provide new Paid Family Leave and improved Short-Term and Long-Term insurance benefits for eligible SMUD employees.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
There is no associated cost or budget to join PRISM. The associated costs are factored into each insurance policy or contract.  

**Alternatives:**  
Not approve, which would jeopardize SMUD’s employee benefits insurance policies, including Paid Family Leave, Short-Term Disability and Long-Term Disability benefits. SMUD is contractually obligated to provide Short-Term and Long-Term Disability insurance plans per our Memorandums of Understanding with our three unions.  

**Affected Parties:**  
SMUD, SMUD employees and their families.

**TO:** Distribution  
**FROM:** Kathy Ketchum / Lisa Limcaco  
**DATE:** August 30, 2024  
**ACC:** 24-016  

**SUBJECT:** JULY 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATIONS DATA  

We are attaching the financial and operating reports for the seven months of 2024. They include sales and generation statistics and other selected data.

The change in net position is an increase of $241.1 million compared to a budgeted increase of $80.3 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $160.8 million.

We prepared these statements on the accrual basis of accounting, and they conform to generally accepted accounting principles. The bases for the budget amounts are:

1) Budgeted electric revenues are based on the Forecast of Revenues by the Pricing Department, adjusted for unbilled revenues; and

2) Budgeted operating expenses reflect the 2024 Budget approved by the Board of Directors on December 14, 2023.

# SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT  
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
### For the Seven Months Ended July 31, 2024  

### Net Position  
- The change in net position is an increase of $241.1 million compared to a budgeted increase of $80.3 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $160.8 million.  

### Revenues  
- Revenues from sales to customers were $1,020.1 million, which was $30.3 million higher than planned.  
  The increase is primarily due to:  
  - Higher residential sales of $32.2 million primarily due to higher customer usage.  
  - Lower commercial sales of $3.7 million primarily due to lower customer usage.  
  - No actual provision for uncollectible accounts compared to a budget of $1.8 million. The current balance of the accumulated provision is sufficient to cover write-offs of arrears.  

- Revenues under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (Assembly Bill [AB] – 32) were $19.7 million.  
  This is due to carbon allowances sold through the state sanctioned quarterly auctions.  
- Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) revenues were $5.0 million due to LCFS credit sales.  
- Other electric revenues were $5.9 million higher due to higher unplanned interconnection fees, transmission revenue, and Sacramento Power Academy revenue.  
- Non-cash revenues transferred to the rate stabilization fund were $36.6 million, of which $22.3 million was for AB-32, $9.3 million was for the annual WAPA Hydro Generation Adjustment and $5.0 million was for LCFS. Funds are deferred until SMUD has qualified program expenses (projects that reduce carbon emissions or electric vehicle programs) to recognize revenue.  
- Non-cash revenues transferred from the rate stabilization fund were $37.5 million, of which $21.1 million was for revenue recognized for AB-32, $8.3 million was for revenue recognized for the annual Hydro Generation Adjustment, and $8.1 million was for LCFS and Community Impact Plan.  

### Commodities, Purchased Power, and Production  
- SMUD’s generation was lower by 515 GWh (10.8 percent); JPA and other generation was lower by 451 GWh (12.3 percent); and Hydro generation was lower by 64 GWh (5.7 percent).  
- Purchased power expense of $236.5 million, less surplus power sales of $78.4 million was $158.1 million, which was $29.6 million higher than planned. This increase is due to lower thermal generation that led to increased market purchases at favorable market prices.  
- Production operations cost of $193.3 million, less surplus gas sales of $47.8 million, was $145.5 million, which was $45.6 million lower than planned.  
  - Fuel costs of $118.0 million less surplus gas sales of $47.8 million, was $70.2 million, which was $33.3 million lower than planned. Fuel costs were lower due to decrease in thermal generation from unplanned major overhauls costs at the Carson, Cosumnes, and Procter & Gamble plants and it was more economical to replace the thermal generation with market purchases.  
- The “power margin”, or sales to customers less cost of purchased power, production operations costs and gas hedges included in investment revenues was $714.8 million, which was $44.4 million higher than planned. The power margin as a percentage of sales to customers was 70.1 percent, which was 2.3 percent higher than planned. This is primarily due to lower production costs due to lower fuel costs and higher customer sales.  

### Other Operating Expenses  
- All other operating expenses were $608.4 million, which was $0.1 million lower than planned.  
  - Transmission and distribution operation expenses were down $7.6 million primarily due to lower cost of transmission fees than planned.  
  - Customer service and information expenses were down $5.5 million due to lower participation in My Energy Optimizer Partner and Peak Conserve programs and lower participation in the Commercial and Residential Greenergy programs.  
  - Administrative & General expenses were up $6.1 million primarily due to bond issuance costs, costs related to the February storm and uncollectible non-electric billings.  
<!-- Page 48 -->
- Public Good expenses were $3.8 million higher than planned primarily due to increased rebate volume in the Advanced Homes Solutions program and earlier start in low income building electrification program initiatives.
- Transmission and distribution maintenance expenses were $1.7 million lower than planned. This is primarily due to the recent operational changes in the vegetation maintenance of transmission and distribution lines.
- Non-cash depreciation and amortization is higher by $3.9 million primarily due to the unplanned amortization of software subscription assets.

Non-operating Revenues and Expenses
- Other revenue, net, was $107.0 million higher than planned primarily due to a business interruption insurance recovery payment of $88.9 million related to the Cosumnes Power Plant, a settlement payment of $7.5 million related to Substation A fire claim, $5.8 million related to the Rancho Seco annual spent fuel settlement, and higher interest income.
