![Removing Sequestration Risk](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=Removing+Sequestration+Risk)

- 2009 Series V and 2010 Series W were issued as taxable Build America Bonds (BABs)
  - Taxable bonds cost more however costs were offset by annual federal interest subsidy reimbursement
  - In 2013, Congress reduced the interest reimbursement costing SMUD almost $7 million

- In addition to sequestration, Congress must approve the federal reimbursement every few years, further increasing risk that the reimbursement could be reduced to zero
