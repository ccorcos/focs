![Executive Summary](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Executive+Summary)

**Executive Summary**  
Natural and human-caused hazards have potential immediate and long-lasting impacts on the lives of people and their communities, financially, economically, and psychologically. Such hazards have the potential to disrupt entire communities. Nationwide, taxpayers pay billions of dollars annually to help communities, organizations, businesses, and individuals recover from disasters. This Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) represents the Sacramento Municipal Utility District’s (SMUD’s) commitment to reduce and eliminate, where possible, the potential risks and impacts of natural and human-created hazards. The HMP serves to help protect SMUD’s assets, customers, and communities by improving disaster preparedness and increasing resiliency. It also serves as a guide for SMUD decisionmakers as they commit resources to reducing the effects of potential hazards on SMUD’s energy infrastructure and workforce.

SMUD’s HMP is a single-jurisdiction plan that geographically covers all areas where SMUD owns, partially owns, or operates critical infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as the Plan Area).

The HMP represents SMUD’s commitment to reduce and eliminate, where possible, the risks and impacts of natural and human-caused hazards. The HMP serves to help protect SMUD’s assets, customers, and communities by coordinating our broad-based disaster preparedness and resiliency efforts.  
The HMP:  
1. Identifies potential hazards faced by communities where SMUD maintains assets or operations,  
2. Assesses the vulnerability of those assets and operations to such hazards, and  
3. Identifies specific actions that can be taken to reduce the risk from identified hazards.  

**Plan Update**  
This plan is a comprehensive update of the 2019 SMUD Hazard Mitigation Plan approved by FEMA on July 11, 2019, and is set to expire July 11, 2024.

SMUD’s 2024-2028 HMP update meets federal requirements for updating hazard mitigation plans on a five-year cycle. It represents the third iteration of SMUD’s hazard mitigation plan, which was initially part of El Dorado County’s HMP. The scope of this HMP update covers 22 counties where SMUD owns, partially owns, or operates critical infrastructure. These counties include areas of Sacramento, El Dorado, Placer, Solano, Colusa, Yolo, Sutter, Alameda, Contra Costa, Glenn, Kings, Kern, Fresno, Merced, Modoc, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, San Bernardino, San Benito, Shasta, Siskiyou, Stanislaus, and Tehama counties.

![Plan Update Approach](https://smud.org)

**Plan Update Approach**  
A governance structure was developed to coordinate the update of the HMP. It included Executive oversight, a director level steering committee, a planning committee, and core team, each with its own roles and responsibilities. The communications team implemented a multi-media public involvement strategy based on past experience, utilizing a number of outreach capabilities including posting public notices in local newspapers, community outreach events, sharing information with public agency partners, local non-profits and supporting agencies, as well as via email.

A draft of this plan was posted on smud.org for public comments in advance of the **(date) SMUD (name) Committee Meeting** and will be considered for approval by the SMUD Board of Directors within eight weeks of receipt of pre-approval from California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

# 1.0 Introduction

## 1.1 Background

FEMA defines “hazard” as “any event or physical condition that has the potential to cause fatalities, injuries, property damage, infrastructure damage, agricultural losses, damage to the environment, interruption of business, or other types of harm or loss.” Additionally, hazard mitigation is “any sustained action taken to reduce or eliminate the long-term risk to human life and property from a hazard event” (44 CFR §201.2). The purpose of hazard mitigation is to reduce potential losses from future disasters. Hazard mitigation planning is essential in helping to reduce or alleviate the loss of life, personal injury, and property damage that can result from a disaster. A hazard mitigation plan forms the foundation of a community's long-term strategy to reduce disaster losses and break the cycle of disaster damage, reconstruction, and repetitive damage. The “purpose of mitigation planning is for state, local and Indian tribal governments to identify the natural hazards that impact them, to identify actions and activities to reduce any losses from those hazards, and to establish a coordinated process to implement the plan, taking advantage of a wide range of resources” (44 CFR § 201.1(b)).

The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (DMA 2000) is federal legislation that establishes a pre-disaster hazard mitigation program and new requirements for the national post-disaster Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). DMA 2000 sets as a condition for receiving federal disaster grant assistance, that state and local government agencies need to have a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved hazard mitigation. DMA 2000 outlines the process that cities, counties, and special districts follow to develop a Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP).

FEMA supports local hazard mitigation planning and the achievement of the following principles:
- Plan and invest for the future;
- Collaborate and engage early; and
- Integrate community planning.

## 1.2 Mitigation Plan Update

SMUD has prepared this update to the 2019 Hazard Mitigation Plan in accordance with the requirements under DMA 2000. The HMP update was prepared pursuant to the requirements of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-390) and the implementing regulations set forth by the Interim Final Rule published in the Federal Register on February 26, 2002, (44 CFR §201.6) and finalized on October 31, 2007. The regulations established the requirements that local hazard mitigation plans must meet in order for a local jurisdiction to be eligible for funding from certain Stafford Act grant programs such as FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Assistance (PDM) Program, the Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Program, the Fire Management Assistance Grant (FMAG), and Public Assistance (PA). This planning effort follows FEMA’s 2023 Local Mitigation Planning Policy Guide (FP 206-21-0002).

# 1.3 Purpose
This HMP represents SMUD’s commitment to reduce the potential risks and impacts of natural and human-caused hazards and serves to help protect SMUD’s, customers, and communities by improving disaster preparedness and increased resiliency. It also serves as a guide for SMUD decision-makers as they commit resources to reducing the effects of potential hazards on SMUD’s energy infrastructure and workforce. The scope of this HMP is limited to the geographic areas of Sacramento, El Dorado, Placer, Solano, Colusa, Yolo, Sutter, Alameda, Contra Costa, Glenn, Kings, Kern, Fresno, Merced, Modoc, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, San Bernardino, San Benito, Shasta, Siskiyou, Stanislaus, and Tehama counties where SMUD owns, partially owns, or operates critical infrastructure facilities. These facilities include, but are not limited to, commercial property, real estate, dams, powerhouses, transmission lines, distribution lines, roads, wind turbines, solar arrays, batteries, and gas pipelines. Each of these facilities is critical to maintaining the flow of power from generating facilities through the transmission lines into Sacramento County. The proper maintenance of these assets helps protect the communities from impacts as a result of natural and man-made hazards such as wildfires, severe storms, dam failure, blackouts, and road closures to name a few.

SMUD’s resiliency can be improved through the proper identification, analysis, planning, and evaluation of proper risk response or mitigation and monitoring of the hazards to which SMUD is most vulnerable. This HMP provides a framework to conduct such an assessment.

This SMUD 2024-2028 HMP Update (is as a single-jurisdiction plan that geographically covers all areas where SMUD directly owns and/or has an ownership and/or operational share of critical infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as the Plan Area). Several stakeholders, including public and private agencies, participated in the planning process.

Information in this plan will be used to help guide and coordinate mitigation activities for SMUD. Proactive mitigation planning will help reduce the cost of disaster response and recovery to communities and their residents by protecting critical facilities, reducing liability exposure, and minimizing overall customer and community impacts and disruptions.

# 1.4 Contents of Updated Plan
This HMP is organized into four primary parts:
- Part 1 – Planning Process and Community Profile
- Part 2 – Risk Assessment

## 2.0 Updates to Plan

### 2.1 Previous Plans
On September 21, 2017, through SMUD Board Resolution 17-09-09, SMUD’s Board of Directors adopted the El Dorado County Local HMP Annex (Annexation Plan). The Annexation Plan focused on SMUD’s assets located in El Dorado County and addressed wildland fire, severe storms, and dam/levee failure hazards.

In June 2018, SMUD received grant funding from FEMA under Disaster Recovery (DR) number 4308 to develop its first single-jurisdiction HMP which included additionally identified hazards and a greater planning area. This plan was adopted by SMUD’s board on June 24, 2019, by Board Resolution 19-06-06. The plan was approved by FEMA on July 11, 2019 and expires July 11, 2024.

### 2.2 Update

#### 2.2.1 Grant Funding
On August 21, 2023, SMUD received grant funding from FEMA under DR-4619-469-007P to update its HMP in accordance with DMA 2000 requirements. The funding was used in the development of this 2024-2028 HMP.

#### 2.2.2 Federal Eligibility
Part 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) stipulates that a jurisdiction covered by a plan that has expired is not able to pursue federal funding for which a current hazard mitigation plan is a prerequisite. SMUD anticipates continuing to pursue FEMA grant funding for various hazard mitigations where a Plan is a prerequisite.

#### 2.2.3 Changes in Development
SMUD continually identifies and assesses changes and developments that could impact or change the levels of risks associated with hazards prone to our planning area. This helps to ensure that mitigation strategies continue to address the risks and vulnerabilities of potential development and takes into consideration possible future conditions that could impact the hazard risk profiles allowing SMUD to allocate resources more efficiently to address SMUD’s highest areas of vulnerabilities.

### 2.3 What Has Changed
SMUD’s 2024-2028 HMP includes several changes including format changes for readability and citation of requirements to demonstrate compliance with CFR Part 44. The following are some highlights of additional changes:
- Enhanced risk assessment,
- Enhanced integrated risk and enterprise business planning,
- Updated and enhanced public outreach,
- Incorporation of SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan,
- Enhance communications to address vulnerable communities,
- Identification of high hazard dams, and
- Enhanced section on climate change.

### 3.0 Planning Process  
This section describes the first step of the HMP planning process - organize resources. Organizing resources includes building the core planning team, determining the outreach plan, and documenting review.  

The planning process accomplished several critical HMP requirements, including identifying the Plan Area, defining general priorities, reviewing the capabilities of the communities within SMUD’s Plan Area, and establishing stakeholder and community outreach and input process. Strategies in developing the continuity of public participation in plan maintenance were also established, as well as means of properly documenting all future changes and updates to the HMP.  

### 3.1 Governance and Planning Team  
SMUD’s Enterprise Risk Management Office is responsible for updating the HMP, its Enterprise Risk Manager assumed the role of lead planner and leveraged SMUD’s existing risk governance structure to assist in the update of this HMP. This governance structure includes Executive oversight, senior management steering committee, a core team, and a planning committee.  

### 3.1.1 Executive Risk Oversight Committee (EROC)  
The Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee (EROC) is made up of SMUD Executives and is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer who is responsible for enterprise-wide risk oversight. During the HMP process, the EROC is responsible for the oversight, direction.

**3.2 Defining Planning Area**  
The Planning Team met to review the 2019 identified Plan Area and to determine changes appropriate to reflect the intent of this plan. SMUD’s Plan Area geographically covers all areas where SMUD directly owns and/or has an ownership and/or operational share of critical infrastructure (hereinafter referred to as the Plan Area). These territories are mostly located in Sacramento, El Dorado, Placer, and Solano counties. However, other areas
<!-- Page 47 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Hazard+Mitigation+Plan+2024+-+2028)

where SMUD owns, is partial owner, or operates critical infrastructure includes small portions of Alameda, Colusa, Contra Costa, Fresno, Glenn, Kern, Kings, Merced, Modoc, San Benito, San Bernardino, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, Shasta, Siskiyou, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tehama, and Yolo counties. Current development does not impact SMUD’s plan, SMUD will continue to assess any potential impacts from future developments.

### 3.3 Stakeholder and Agency Coordination
The Plan must provide an opportunity for neighboring communities, local and regional agencies involved in hazard mitigation activities, and agencies that have the authority to regulate development as well as business, academia, and other private and non-profit interests to be involved in the planning process (44 CFR § 201.6(b)(2)).

Stakeholders (table 7) were invited to participate in the plan development via an email invitation on October 25, 2023. Throughout the year, SMUD staff works closely with local jurisdictions bodies in which infrastructure critical to SMUD’s operations exist and with regulatory bodies having authority over such infrastructure. Stakeholders received an email invitation to also participate in the review of SMUD’s HMP.

A copy of the draft HMP was posted online during a public comment period. The public was invited to review and provide their input. The public comment period was from December 1, 2023, to January 2, 2024. Additionally, the public was given opportunities to provide comment at two duly noticed public meetings, the Board (name) Committee Meeting and Board Meeting on (dates).

## 3.4 Regional Participation

SMUD regularly participates in regional and local forums to collaborate on shared interest in various risks, emergency response and mitigation planning, and information sharing. These meetings are generally open meetings that include public input. Information from these meetings was used to inform, identify, and prioritize risks in this HMP. Table 8 summarizes examples of this participation.

SMUD’s government affairs team is engaged in several efforts with regional stakeholders to discuss various hazards and climate resilience. These meetings are not public meetings. SMUD government affairs have also participated in discussions about regional climate resiliency with a group comprised of SACOG, AQMD, SacRT, SAFCA, RWA and El Dorado County Fire Council over the last year. These are not public meetings.

The SMUD Emergency Operation Center (EOC) may participate in planning exercises with other EOCs and first responders; those exercises are not a public forum.

The maps were available to the public for review and comment prior to approval. Primary responsibility for the development of the CPUC Fire Threat Map was delegated to PDP, a group of utility fire planning experts, and the Independent Review Team led by CalFire. |

### 3.5 Public Involvement
The public must have had an opportunity to be involved in the current planning process during the drafting stage and prior to plan approval. The plan must document what the participation entailed, including how under-resourced communities and vulnerable populations within the planning area were provided an opportunity to be involved. The plan must document how public feedback was included throughout the planning process (44 CFR § 201.6(b)(1)).

#### 3.5.1 Strategy
The Planning Team reviewed SMUD’s 2019 public involvement and identified a strategic approach to public involvement for the 2024-2028 HMP. This strategic approach was focused on:
- information sharing with the public on HMP planning and drafting process,
- having materials available at public outreach events for the general public with a focus on vulnerable communities, and
- updating SMUD’s HMP to reflect public outreach activities and participation.

#### 3.5.2 Public Notice
SMUD provided notice in local newspapers during the planning stage and the draft review stage to welcome public input regarding the HMP update. These notices were published in the Sacramento Bee and the Mountain Democrat on the following dates: October 16, 2023, and December 1, 2023.

### 3.5.4 Hazard Mitigation Plan Website and E-mail
During the development of SMUD’s 2019 HMP, SMUD staff established a dedicated webpage and email to share information on SMUD’s HMP. This webpage will continue to serve as a central location to keep the public apprised of upcoming outreach events, meeting dates and times, and the plan update process (see table 11). The webpage address is: [smud.org/HazardMitigation](http://smud.org/HazardMitigation) and the email address is: ERM@smud.org. The webpage and email were included in all public notifications, public presentations, and outreach materials.

### 3.5.5 Public Comments on Draft Plan
In addition to the listed organizations in table 7, a draft copy of the HMP was made available to the public for review. The public was given opportunity to comment on the draft HMP.
- The draft HMP was made available on SMUD's website ([smud.org](http://smud.org)) for public review from December 1, 2023, to January 2, 2024. Public comments are addressed in the final HMP.
- SMUD also provided an opportunity for public comments on the draft HMP at a regularly scheduled Finance and Audit Committee Board Meeting¹.
- There were no comments received through the public review period.

SMUD Board Committee meetings are open and accessible to the public. Meeting notices and agendas are posted, at minimum, 72 hours in advance at the SMUD office and on SMUD’s website. Those who are unable to attend the meeting in-person can livestream the meeting or view a recording on SMUD’s website.

SMUD is committed to public participation. In accordance with California open meeting laws (California Government Code Sections 54960 et. seq.) SMUD Board meetings are open to the public and the public is invited to comment at these meetings. The public will continue to be involved in future HMP updates. Prior to adoption of formal updates, SMUD will provide the opportunity for the public to comment on the updates. A public notice will be posted prior to the meeting to announce the comment period and meeting logistics.

### 3.6 Existing Documents and Programs
The plan should describe the review and incorporation of existing plans, studies, reports, and technical information (44 CFR § 201.6(b)(3)). Linking existing plans and policies to the HMP helps to identify which resources already exist that can be used to implement the action items identified in the plan.

SMUD’s plan includes a range of recommended action items that, when implemented, could reduce the Plan Area’s vulnerability to natural hazards. Many of these recommendations are consistent with the goals and objectives of SMUD’s existing plans and policies. Table 10 accounts for the plans and policies already in place in SMUD’s Plan Area that were reviewed for or incorporated as a part of the HMP planning process:

¹ The Finance and Audit Committee Board Meeting was held on (October 2, 2018) at 5:30 P.M. at 6301 S Street, Sacramento, CA 95817

**4.5 SMUD Priorities**  
Multiple risks and hazards have the potential to impact SMUD’s operations. SMUD addresses these risks and hazards as a part of its ongoing Enterprise Risk Management and Insurance Programs activities and includes them in the capital investment prioritization process. Historical data indicates that wildfire, storms, floods, and earthquakes account for the greatest losses incurred by SMUD and should be designated as priority threats. In addition, climate change has the potential to increase the impacts of these hazards as well as others.

**4.6 The Electric System**  
SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. SMUD delivers energy to its customers from a variety of sources. The sources include large hydropower, natural-gas-fired generators, renewable energy (solar, wind, small hydro, geothermal, and biomass), and power it purchases on the wholesale market. The largest single source of power for SMUD is the Cosumnes Power Plant (described below). SMUD’s UARP is its cleanest and most economical power source.

**4.6.1 The Distribution and Transmission System, Sacramento County**  
SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through 230 kilovolt (kV) and 115 kV transmissions systems. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants, and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system except for the Sacramento downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission systems. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV and 69 kV substations with overhead and underground distribution circuits.

**4.6.2 Hydroelectric System**  
SMUD’s hydroelectric system includes nine SMUD-owned and operated hydroelectric powerhouses rated at approximately 700MW in the Western Sierra Nevada Mountain region. The hydroelectric systems span approximately 50 miles with the highest elevation reservoir at Rubicon Reservoir and descends the mountain range terminating at Chili Bar Powerhouse. All total there are nine hydroelectric powerhouses with seven of them interconnected with dedicated 69kV and 230kV transmission lines. The remaining two hydroelectric powerhouses South Fork and Chili Bar are interconnected directly into PG&E’s 12kV and 21kV local distribution systems. Approximately twenty linear miles of overhead 230kV transmission lines connect the hydroelectric system to SMUD’s service area near Folsom. The hydroelectric powerhouses are fed from the various dam-formed.

4.6.6 Transmission  
The transmission system carries electricity from generation to the distribution system over long distances at high voltages. SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through a 230 kV and 115 kV transmission systems. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants, other than the Solano Wind Project, and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system except for the Sacramento downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission systems. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations.

4.6.7 Distribution  
Distribution systems move power from transmission to end use customers. The distribution assets consist of thousands of unique parts that are customary and usual for the operation of electric distribution systems. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV and 69/4 kV substations with overhead and undergrounds distribution circuits.

4.7 Gas Pipeline  
SMUD owns a transmission gas pipeline, has an equity interest in two PG&E backbone gas transmission lines, and contracts with existing interstate natural gas transmission lines to deliver natural gas to its power plants.

SMUD’s diversified portfolio of gas transmission arrangements allow for the purchase of gas from a variety of suppliers and locations, and the opportunity to capitalize on regional price differentials where possible. SMUD’s ownership interest in the SMUD/PG&E backbone and Local Pipeline enhances the reliability of SMUD’s gas supply.

4.7.1 The Gas Pipeline  
SMUD constructed and owns a 20 inch (in.), 50- mile natural gas pipeline in the greater Sacramento area (the “Local Pipeline”) that transports gas to all the Local Gas-Fired Plants except SPA McClellan (See Figure 6). The Local Pipeline is interconnected with PG&E’s major California gas transmission lines 400 and 401 at the Winters intertie. Additionally, it may be interconnected with one or more private gas gathering pipelines located in the area, and/or other FERC approved pipelines that may be built in the local area. In conjunction with the construction of the SFA Project, SMUD extended the Local Pipeline to the plant site. The 26-mile extension was completed in 2004. The extension is 24 in. in diameter and was designed to serve both the SFA Project and an additional second phase, if constructed.

![Figure 6: SMUD Local Pipeline](https://example.com/path/to/image)

4.7.2 PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 400 and 401  
In 1996, SMUD purchased an equity interest in PG&E's backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 (referred to as the PG&E backbone). The total capacity acquired is currently approximately 86,700 Dth/day. It consists of approximately 47,572 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, Oregon and 39,193 Dth/day from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD's interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California. This purchase made SMUD a co-owner of the PG&E backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401. It obligated SMUD to pay PG&E to operate the pipelines on its behalf, subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and operating protocols.

4.7.3 Gas Storage  
SMUD also employs gas storage as part of its overall fuel supply strategy. Gas storage is useful in helping to balance gas supply, mitigate market price volatility, and provide a reliable supply to meet peak day delivery requirements.

4.8 TANC California-Oregon Transmission Project  
The California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) is one part of a three-part 500 kV-line coordinated system known as the California-Oregon Intertie (COI). The COTP is allocated one-third of the 4,800 MW capability of the COI system. It can help increase awareness of business risks across an entire organization, instill confidence in strategic objectives, improve compliance with regulatory and internal mandates, and enhance operational efficiency through more consistent applications of processes and controls. The Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) is entitled to use 1,390 MW. SMUD is a member of TANC and is entitled to 378 MW of the COTP capacity. SMUD is entitled to approximately 528 MW of TANC’s transfer capability. SMUD relies on its COTP rights to purchase power and obtain renewable resources to supplement its own resources to serve its load.  

4.9 SMUD Capital Projects  
SMUD’s annual budget provides funding for capital programs necessary to meet the Board’s Strategic Directives over the year and to ensure continuity into the future.  

SMUD’s 2024 enterprise portfolio includes investments across our five strategic pillars – safety and reliability, environmental leadership, community vitality, affordability, and organizational agility. The proposed capital investment budget for 2024 is $555 million for planned investment in energy transmission, distribution, buildings, vehicles, technology, and other assets critical to meeting the energy needs of our customers and community. Proposed capital expenditures go through a rigorous evaluation and prioritization process, based on strategic alignment, risk, criticality, and financials to ensure SMUD prioritizes work that has the highest contribution to the Board’s Strategic Directions and our 2030 Zero Carbon vision.

# 6.0 Physical Setting
SMUD’s service territory is within Sacramento County; any impacts as a result of a hazard event to SMUD’s Plan Area would have the greatest impact to the Sacramento Region. As such, the assessment provided in section 6.0 will be focused on Sacramento County.

## 6.1 Geography
Sacramento County lies just north of the center of California’s Central Valley. The confluence of two of the state’s major rivers, the Sacramento and the American, lies within the County. The southwestern portion of the County extends far into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, to the point just north of Antioch, where nearly all waters of the Central Valley converge. To the south, San Joaquin County is primarily agricultural. The wooded foothills of the Sierra Nevada rise to the east in Amador and El Dorado Counties.5

In general, Sacramento County’s topography can be characterized by a broad band of very flat valley floor land in the western sector, a transition zone of gently sloping alluvial plains in the central sector, and a low foothill region in the eastern sector. Elevations range from below sea level in the delta island area in the Southwest corner of the County to approximately 800 feet in the foothill region.6

## 6.2 Climate
Sacramento County is characterized by a mild climate, with year-round sunshine. The summers are warm, with dry days and mild nights. “Rainy season” historically occurs from November through February. Mountains surround the Sacramento Valley to the west, north and east.

Torrential rain and heavy snow frequently fall on the western Sierra Nevada slopes, the southern Cascades, and to a lesser extent, the Coast Range. As a result, flood conditions occasionally occur along the Sacramento River and its tributaries.7

# 7.2 Indicators for Social Vulnerability

SMUD understands that some populations are at a greater risk from the impacts of hazard events because of physical abilities or limited resources. The vulnerable populations may vary from the general population in risk perception, living conditions, access to information and services, and capabilities to address hazard impacts.

## 7.2.1 Customer Opt-In Program
SMUD has implemented an opt-in program on smud.org that allows for vulnerable populations to enroll and receive additional information or notifications in the event of a hazard occurrence in SMUD service territory. Among SMUD’s vulnerable customers are those enrolled in the Medical Equipment Discount Rate program (MED rate), Energy Assistance Program rate, 3rd Party & Senior ID and those that have self-identified and are enrolled in the vulnerable customer program. These include customers who may rely on specialized medical equipment.

## 7.2.2 Sustainable Communities
In addition to its Opt-In Program, SMUD has a Sustainable Communities Team which oversees a community-focused program to enhance the quality of life for all SMUD customers through innovative energy solutions. The program helps bring environmental equity and economic vitality to all communities in SMUD’s service area, with special attention given to historically underserved neighborhoods.

In order to deploy comprehensive resources to the communities most in need, SMUD has developed an interactive map to help analyze current data to indicate the local areas most likely to be underserved or in distress by lack of community development, income, housing, employment opportunities, transportation, medical treatment, nutrition, education and clean environment. This map will be leveraged to support the identification of vulnerable communities during hazard events. SMUD’s interactive sustainability map can be found here: Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map (smud.org). Figure 7 shows a stationary view of SMUD’s Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map.

A number of factors were considered when developing the interactive map. The factors considered in developing the map include:

- **Opportunity Zones**  
  Opportunity zones are a new tool for community development. Established in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Opportunity Zones provide tax incentives for investment in designated census tracts. California Opportunity Zones will support new investments in environmental justice, sustainability, climate change and affordable housing.

- **Sacramento Promise Zone**  
Sacramento's designation in 2015 as a “promise zone” by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development is the catalyst for service expansion in Sacramento’s most economically distressed neighborhoods. Through the Promise Zone Initiative, the federal government works with local leaders and organizations to improve the quality of life for residents in underserved neighborhoods.  

As one of 16 urban promise zones in the nation, Sacramento’s promise zone encompasses 22 square miles from Del Paso Heights in the north to The Avenues in the south. Among the 127,000 residents within the promise zone, 34% are living in poverty, 19% are unemployed and 63% of third graders are reading below grade level.  

- **SB 535 Disadvantaged Communities**  
Areas designated as Disadvantaged Communities by state Senate Bill 535 are specifically targeted for investment of proceeds from the State’s cap-and-trade program. These investments are aimed at improving public health, quality of life and economic opportunity in California’s most burdened communities, while at the same time reducing pollution that causes climate change.  

- **Sacramento Poverty, by Zip Code**  
The US Census Bureau determines the Federal Poverty Level each year. The poverty level is based on the size of the household and the ages of family members. If a person or family’s total income before taxes is less than the poverty level, the person or family are considered in poverty. The areas shown within this data set represent those zip codes within Sacramento County where 25% of the population are considered to be below the poverty line.  

- **Medically Underserved Areas**  
Medically underserved areas or populations are areas designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) as having too few primary care providers, high infant mortality, high poverty or a high elderly population. Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) are designated by HRSA as having shortages of primary medical care, dental or mental health providers and may be geographic (a county or service area), a population (e.g., low income or Medicaid eligible) or facilities (e.g., federally qualified health center or other state or federal prisons).  

- **Healthy Sacramento Coalition – Health Equity**  
The Healthy Coalition’s goal is to reduce tobacco use, obesity, death, and disability due to chronic disease, as well as reduce health disparities, build a safe and healthy physical environment, and improve the social and emotional well-being of Sacramento County residents. The coalition conducted an assessment identifying 15 zip codes that had consistently high rates of poor health outcomes.

- **Social Vulnerability to Climate Change Impacts in California**  
  The social vulnerability index shows social vulnerability to climate change related impacts, such as natural disasters or increased heat stress. Vulnerability is defined as the susceptibility of a population to harm from exposure to a hazard and its ability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from hazards.

- **Environmental Justices: CalEnviroScreen 3.0**  
  CalEnviroScreen identifies California communities by census tract that are disproportionately burdened by, and vulnerable to, multiple sources of pollution.

### 7.3 Economy

#### 7.3.1 Industry, Businesses, and Institutions  
SMUD provides electrical power to the Sacramento Region powering the state capital, technology industries, critical infrastructure, support services, businesses, agriculture, and other critical services essential to this region. An impact to SMUD’s critical infrastructure could potentially have catastrophic impacts to the operations and viability of the entire region. These potential events are discussed in the hazards sections below.

#### 7.3.2 Employment Trends and Occupations  
As of May 2023, the unemployment rate in the Sacramento region remained below 5 percent. The rate has improved compared to California, but higher as compared to US unemployment rates seen in figure 8. The health care service and the education sector experienced significant job gains with nearly 13,000 jobs in the last 12 months and the construction sector performed the worst seeing a decline of more than 3,000 jobs during the same timeframe.

8.0 Hazards  
A number of different data points were used in identifying the hazards that are most likely to impact SMUD’s Plan Area. These data points included past disasters within California, types of disasters, what identified disasters are in California’s Hazard Mitigation Plan, as well as past disaster declarations impacting the Plan Area. Additional details on these data points will be discussed below.

8.1 Disaster Declaration  
A study conducted by Moneygeek cited California as one of the most disaster-prone states with 282 disasters from 2003 to July 2023. The breakdown of the disaster count for California can be viewed in table 15. The breakdown of the declared disaster category for SMUD’s Plan Area is outlined in figure 10.

## Risk Assessment

<!-- Page 89 -->
# 10.0 Risk Assessment Methodology
Hazard risk assessment is the process of measuring the potential impact to life or property, as well as economic impacts, resulting from the hazard. Its intent is to identify from available data, the vulnerabilities of a community. The results provide a foundation on which to develop and prioritize mitigation actions to reduce damage from hazards by improving preparedness and response times and allocating resources to areas with the greatest vulnerability.

## 10.1 Risk Assessment Tools
### 10.1.1 Results and Methodology
SMUD maintains an ERM program which provides a framework and repeatable and consistent methodologies to identify, assess, manage, plan, and respond to risks and hazards to which SMUD is most vulnerable. The ERM program methodology takes into consideration impacts to six different areas (financial, legal, regulatory and compliance, workforce, reputation, operations, and strategy), as well as the likelihood and velocity of the risk occurrence. Implementing this framework and methodology, SMUD has identified the hazards listed in Table 24 that will be addressed in this HMP.

### 10.1.2 Mapping
Maps were produced using geographic information system (GIS) software to show the spatial extent and location of hazards when such datasets were available. SMUD has its own internal GIS function that leverages national, state, county, and city databases as well as its own to locate available spatially based data relevant to this planning effort. The maps are included in the hazard profile chapters.

### 10.1.3 Modeling
SMUD leveraged FEMA’s GIS-based software program Hazards U.S. (Hazus) as well as past events in SMUD’s Plan Area to estimate the risk impacts in the Plan Area. Hazus is used to support risk assessments, mitigation planning, and emergency planning, and response. It provides a wide range of data to estimate potential losses from natural disasters.

## 10.2 Risk Assessment Approach
### 10.2.1 Enterprise Risk Management Framework
SMUD uses its existing ERM framework to identify and assess the various hazards and a summary of these assessments is included in table 21 below. SMUD’s ERM framework takes into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors to determine the level of inherent and residual risk of a particular hazard. An inherent risk level refers to the risk before any mitigations or controls are in place while the residual risk level refers to the risk after all mitigations and effective controls are considered.

All identified risks in the ERM portfolio are owned by an Executive and managed at the Director level. During a risk evaluation, the Director, manager, stakeholders, and subject matter experts are consulted. ERM staff gathers pertinent information to conduct the

![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Hazard+Mitigation+Plan+2024+-+2028)

evaluation which includes a root cause analysis. Information gathered includes key risk drivers, key risk impacts, mitigations, processes, procedures, controls, and internal/external risk trend.

SMUD’s ERM process is integrated with internal audit processes. This integrated approach works to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and controls implemented by management to reduce risks. ERM reviews the audit results to determine if the controls are effective strategies or are found to be ineffective. ERM staff will reassess any residual enterprise risk and work with the business areas to identify what else, if anything, needs to be done to further manage the risk to be within management’s objectives.

SMUD has reviewed the hazards and determined the likelihood of occurrence, extent, severity, and significance that the hazards would have on SMUD infrastructure and business operations if they occurred.

# 11.0 Fire Hazards

## 11.1 Wildfire

### 11.1.1 General Background
A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire in a natural setting that is associated with combustible vegetation, and/or fuel. FEMA defines a wildfire as an unplanned fire burning in natural or wildland areas such as forests, shrub lands, grasslands, or prairies. Wildfires are most prevalent in conditions with high temperatures, low moisture content in the air, increased fuel accumulation, and high winds.

Climate change has the potential to exacerbate conditions ripe for wildfires. Jason Funk, senior climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) says “there is very well documented scientific evidence that climate change is increasing the length of the fire season, the size of the area burned each year and the number of wildfires.” The severity of wildland fires is generally a function of a terrain’s combustible vegetation material and weather conditions. Tree stress and mortality, including damage due to insect infestations such as the bark beetle, exacerbate fire hazards.

### 11.1.2 Hazard Profile
Wildfires in the State of California have become increasingly common and destructive. Frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased, and further increase, the possibility of wildfires occurring in areas where SMUD maintains generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. The number of diseased and dead trees has increased and could further increase this possibility. As a result, SMUD faces an increased risk that it may be required to pay for wildfire related property damage or personal injuries, fines, and penalties, some of which may not be covered by insurance, or may be disputed by insurers and could be material. In addition, a significant fire, or fires in SMUD’s facilities, result in a temporary or permanent loss of energy load or otherwise materially increase SMUD’s costs or materially adversely affect SMUD’s ability to operate its Electrical System or generate revenues.

In SMUD’s Plan Area, fire season generally extends from early spring through late fall, due to the dry and hot nature of these months. If a fire occurs along an urban or rural interface, there is a high potential the fire could destroy structures, damage critical infrastructure, injure people and could result in the loss of lives.

There are a multitude of factors contributing to the increased quantity and size of wildfires plaguing the state. These factors include increased fuel loading, an increase in human-caused ignition capabilities, increased winds, climate change which is influencing drought, longer, hotter stretches of weather and increased tree mortality. Steep slopes also contribute to fire hazards by intensifying the effects of wind, making fire suppression difficult.

**Location**  
SMUD directly participated in the development of the CPUC’s Fire-Threat Map, which defines the statewide High Fire Threat District (HFTD). As a territory lead in the HFTD map development process, SMUD collaborated with utility staff, local fire, and government officials to identify areas within its service territory that may be at an elevated or extreme risk of powerline ignited wildfires. Through peer reviews and assessments by an independent team of nationwide experts led by CAL FIRE, it was determined that SMUD’s service area is appropriately situated outside the HFTD. However, some of SMUD's UARP facilities are located within both Tier 2 and Tier 3 of the HFTD, outside its service area. Despite not being regulated by the CPUC, SMUD has integrated the HFTD map into its construction, inspection, maintenance, repair, and clearance practices where applicable. SMUD believes that the HFTD map accurately identifies the level of wildfire risk within its service territory and UARP.

The CPUC Fire-Threat map identifies Tier 3, extreme fire risk, Tier 2, elevated fire risk and areas outside of the HFTD. Figure 11 depicts the CPUC Fire-Threat Map and SMUD’s service area location within the map.

SMUD’s Plan Area within the HFTD has a higher susceptibility to wildfires specifically due to the Mediterranean climate which facilitates regular drought conditions as well as the natural plant communities that produce excess fuel, and the natural and anthropogenic ignition sources. SMUD’s greatest fire threat risk is in the Western Sierra Nevada Mountain range, where the hydroelectric project known as the “UARP” is located. Within the UARP, vegetation adjacent to electrical infrastructure (powerhouses, transmission lines, switchyards, etc.) is a source of fuel. Extended periods of warm temperatures as well as greater numbers of diseased and dead trees may increase the possibility of wildfires occurring in SMUD’s generation and service territories.

SMUD imports a large portion of the energy needed to serve its customers from out of its service area through the Western Area Power Authority transmission lines. These lines traverse many areas susceptible to wildfires. Actual destruction of such lines does happen, but this is not the most common threat. When a fire threatens long distance transmission lines, grid operators will derate the line. This means that less than the scheduled amount of power will be allowed to be carried by the line. This is done to reduce the amount of power which would be suddenly lost if the line were to be damaged. During heavy load periods, SMUD may not be able to obtain enough power from other sources to make up for the power lost from the derated line. Figure 12 below shows the area of the CPUC Fire Threat Map specific to SMUD’s UARP.

In addition to the UARP, open lands where SMUD’s assets lie also pose a risk related to grass fires. Grass fires can travel very fast and threaten nearby residential areas as well as critical infrastructure.

**Frequency & Severity**  
SMUD electric systems include several energized features that inherently possess the risk of wildland fire hazard, with the potential to affect other infrastructure as well as structures in the surrounding areas. Even with little change in their frequency, the wildfires that California sees on an annual basis can still pose a threat to electricity infrastructure for SMUD. Physical infrastructure in the direct path of a fire can see extensive damage, especially smaller lines, often fitted with wooden poles. Soot collecting on equipment and ionized particulate matter in the air can cause leakage currents or arcing. Firefighting measures can foul lines, requiring extensive cleanup or repair after the fire is cleared. Transmission lines are affected by high heat, smoke, and particulate matter of the fire; therefore, lines may be shut down as a safety measure.

Much of SMUD’s electricity is imported using transmission lines through wildfire-prone lands. Due to multiple climate factors, critical transmission lines will be operating near their limits in the future. Wildfire events will further strain the system and its ability to deliver reliable power to SMUD customers.

Rural communities within El Dorado County that are situated in heavily forested areas are particularly vulnerable to wildfire. Fire can also impact the general community by damaging infrastructure such as roads, telecommunication systems, and community buildings.

**Past Events**  
SMUD has never experienced a catastrophic wildfire involving its facilities. SMUD’s service area in Sacramento County has a much lower wildfire risk profile than other areas in the State that have suffered destructive wildfires in recent years. When ignition events occur, they have historically been limited in scope. This is largely due to SMUD’s more urban environment, flatter accessible terrain, low grasslands and other fuel sources outside forested areas and fewer wind events.

According to CalFire’s website, the five-year average between January – July time period is 3,067 fires and 28,875 acres burned. In 2022, the state endured 7,477 fires covering 331,360 acres. For the periods from January 1, 2023, to July 1, 2023, California endured 2,251 fires spanning 7,601 acres. This number continues to grow.

Large fires have been a part of the landscape history of the State of California, specifically, El Dorado County for centuries. Table 22 lists the most significant fires that have occurred near the Plan Area.

*Near TANC Transmission Lines

It is known from 1900, and earlier, that large fires occurred in this part of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and frequent fire return intervals (2-20 years in lower montane zone areas around Camino, Placerville, and Pollock Pines). Foothill regions of such, as where the UARP is located, burn frequently with mixed severity.

The most notable recent wildfires are the Caldor and Dixie fires in 2021, the King Fire in 2014, the Fred’s Fire in 2004, and the Cleveland Fire in 1992. Historically, areas above 5,000 feet were less likely to see a major fire (between Robbs Peak and Loon Lake), with one major fire, Bottle Hill, in 1917 near Gerle Creek Reservoir. Several large fires have periodically burned in the lower elevation canyon areas near White Rock Powerhouse, the most recent being the Chili Bar Fire in 1979.

Although the Caldor and King fires did not substantially damage hydroelectric infrastructure, they did do major damage to the forest and watersheds around the UARP.
<!-- Page 100 -->
According to the U.S. Forest Service in El Dorado County, it is unlikely for any treatments or post fire timber harvesting to be conducted in the steep canyons where much of the hydroelectric infrastructure is located. A recent study indicates that without post fire logging or surface fuel treatments, woody fuels accumulate at a rate that exceeds the decomposition rate. As fuel accumulates, so does the fire hazard in the UARP area.

11.1.3 Secondary Impacts  
The aftermath of wildfires can see increases in debris runoff as infiltration capacity of soil is reduced in the wildfire area, especially during rain events within the two years following a significant fire. Heavy rain events following a fire may also allow water to infiltrate the loose ground soil, increasing the potential for landslides. Large swings in rainfall from season to season can encourage vegetation growth in rainy periods, leaving more fire feedstock during subsequent dry seasons and priming conditions for the spread of wildfires.

Runoff from heavy rain events also affects the production of hydropower systems that are downstream from fire prone areas, as wildfire soot and residue collect in the waterways which feed the plant. This silt and particulate matter can reduce production or even damage the turbines. As precipitation patterns change in the coming decades, the aftereffects of wildfires could increase concerns for the impact on SMUD infrastructure from runoff, vegetation growth, and landslides.

11.1.4 Exposure and Vulnerability  
Fire also can damage the UARP infrastructure, which includes transmission lines, powerhouses, project roads, and penstocks. Recreationalists at UARP campgrounds are particularly vulnerable if access routes are destroyed or blocked during fires. Fuel reduction treatments, including thinning, brushing, removal of forest slash and mastication along the project corridors and around powerhouses can reduce such risks. Fire also creates indirect impacts on UARP operations. Land erosion associated with denuded hillslopes, for example, can increase sedimentation of reservoirs and degrade water quality.

Recreation facilities associated with the UARP can be damaged directly by the fire, requiring lengthy periods of reconstruction. The loss of the aesthetic value of surrounding forests can also depress recreation during the long process of forest regeneration, which can have a negative effect on the economy for several years.

11.1.5 Current Mitigation Efforts  
As a condition of the FERC fifty-year license authorizing SMUD to operate the UARP, SMUD is required to file with FERC, a Fire Prevention and Response Plan (FPRP) developed in consultation with appropriate State and local fire agencies and approved by the USFS. SMUD’s FPRP filed with FERC was developed in consultation with the USFS, BLM and CalFire.

The FRPR provides in depth fire risk analysis of SMUD’s most fire vulnerable regions as well as historical data, roles and responsibilities and prevention/preparedness activities.

SMUD regularly coordinates with local fire agencies and other first response agencies. It also participates with emergency operations activities in its system areas. SMUD has robust Vegetation Management (VM) programs with accelerated and targeted VM work (pruning & removal) cycles and is using enhanced technologies including LiDAR and Ortho Imagery (these technologies can help identify diseased trees and trees that are a risk to SMUD facilities). It also has robust asset inspection and maintenance programs that include traditional aerial patrols with helicopters, IR inspections using helicopters (which can detect heat from power equipment before an event occurs) and regular ground inspections of all facilities (including core testing of the wood poles).

SMUD maintains a Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) that is reviewed and updated on an annual basis. The plan identifies the risks, SMUD’s wildfire management programs/process, and additional mitigations where necessary. In addition, it also outlines SMUD’s customer, community and stakeholder outreach and communications during de-energization events.

Table 23 depicts the activities SMUD utilizes to address specific wildfire risk factors.

**SMUD continues to meet or exceed vegetation clearance requirements and other industry standards. SMUD has also identified a series of measures for its entire electric system intended to prevent wildfires from occurring, minimize the spread of any fire that does occur, and improve the resiliency of its system. These measures include the installation of Cal-Fire approved exempt material to reduce the risk of sparking; the strengthening of equipment exposed to strong wind conditions, and the increased monitoring of, and identified response to, fire conditions.**

**SMUD uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping of wildfire hazard areas to analyze and plan infrastructure development. It also addresses and continuously reevaluates its assets for the density and quantity of developments, emergency access, landscaping, and water supply. SMUD performs regular patrols of vegetation and obstruction around SMUD facilities in areas that are specifically designated by CalFire as hazardous. SMUD has cyclical weed clearing and tree-trimming programs for all its equipment, regardless of the area’s fire risk.**

**SMUD practices fuel management activities that are essential in establishing the desired levels of fire protection, while also minimizing the detrimental impacts of vegetation removal on the local terrain. Fuel management activities include grazing, prescribed burns, firewood collection of hazardous fuels, mechanical vegetation removal, and limited chemical vegetation control. SMUD has special approval from local agencies to remove vegetation with increased “fuel ladder” potential that exist outside SMUD’s right of way. A “fuel ladder” is any vegetation that would allow fire to climb into the tree canopy. In addition, SMUD works with property owners to identify and perform tree pruning and removal on private property. SMUD works with the property owners to ensure they understand the work needed to ensure public safety and reliability. See Figure 13 below for examples of vegetation management clearing of distribution right of ways.**

**The identified responses include operational procedures for the de-energization of lines during high fire threat conditions, and operational protocols for disabling the use of reclosing functionality on our transmission lines within the high fire threat areas and on our distribution lines during fire season in areas of high vegetation.**

| Wildfire Mitigation Plan            | SMUD maintains a Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) that is reviewed and updated on an annual basis. The plan identifies the risks, SMUD’s wildfire management programs/process, and additional mitigations where necessary. In addition, it also outlines SMUD’s customer, community and stakeholder outreach and communications during de-energization events. |
| Vegetation Management Program       | SMUD maintains a vegetation management program. Trees are trimmed on one-, two-, or three-year reoccurring cycles within SMUD’s Plan Area, and 18 months for those trees identified as fast growing. SMUD also removes trees with high fuel ladder potential (vegetation that allows fire to climb up into the tree canopy). This may include the elimination of hazardous trees outside of SMUD’s right-of-way. |
| Supplier joint response coordination | Since much of SMUD’s critical assets and replacement parts are unique or made to order and the lead-time for manufacturing and delivery of these materials could take up to a year. It is important for the continued operation of the power grid to |

| Substation transformer oil testing   | SMUD performs oil sampling and testing on substation class transformers on a fixed interval to monitor gasses and other contaminants. Monitoring the gasses has allowed us to prevent failures that could result in oil expulsion and spills. The intervals are shortened where certain thresholds are met. |
| Visual and Infrared (IR) inspections on substation equipment | SMUD performs Visual and IR inspections on substation equipment on a fixed interval. The inspections allow crews to identify potential hazards and problems. Issues found are corrected based on severity of the problem and nature of the equipment. |
| Automatic reclosing                 | All Valley 115 kV, 230 kV and UARP 69 kV, 230 kV transmission auto reclosers are disabled and will remain disabled to mitigate wildfire risks. SMUD disables automatic reclosing on certain substation and line reclosers that extend into the Pole Clearing Area (PCA) during fire season. |
| De-energization                     | De-energization of lines based on pre-determined conditions.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Purchase larger substation plots     | Land for new substations is purchased large enough to allow transformers to be installed with adequate space around them to allow for fire breaks. The extra space also allows the transformers to be installed far enough away from potential structures on adjacent property to minimize the risk of urban structure fires. |
| System enhancement capital projects  | Install non-expulsion devices in PCA. Replace #6 copper conductors with heavier gauge aluminum. Upgrade existing 12kV feeders to SCADA reclosers in PCA. Strengthen fire break valve via UARP Fuels Reduction.                     |

## 11.2 Wildland-Urban Interfaced Structural Fires
### 11.2.1 General Background
Wildland-urban interfaced structural fires refer to the fire potential of development interspersed within, or adjacent to, landscapes that support wildland fire. Urban is defined as an area with greater than one housing unit per acre.

Wildland-urban interfaced structural fires have become an increasing concern especially in the aftermath of the Maui fire where a fast-moving fire roared down the west side of the island. A combination of drought, abundant vegetation and high winds could increase the experience of urban land fires.

<!-- Page 106 -->
![Hazard Profile](https://example.com/image-url)

## 11.2.2 Hazard Profile

### Location
Wildland-urban interfaced fires have the greatest effect in locations where development has expanded into rural areas. Urban fires pose an increased threat to that of standard wildfires, as they can spread quickly between structures that are placed within close vicinity of one another. The community, critical infrastructure, and public safety are each affected by wildland-urban interfaced fire damages. SMUD owns, partially owns or operates infrastructure in wildland-urban interfaced areas at potential risk of impacts resulting from wildland-urban interfaced fires.

### Frequency and Severity
The severity of wildland-urban interfaced fires is influenced by a multitude of components, including the vegetative fuel in the area of the fire, the weather conditions, and the slope of the land. California and local agencies have adopted building codes that reduce the risk of fire embers igniting buildings. Building codes assist with reducing the frequency and severity of wildland-urban interfaced fires. However, climate change increases the risk of wildland-urban interfaced occurrence and the potential for higher rates and severity of fires increase as people move closer to fire-susceptible wildland areas.

### Past Events
SMUD has not experienced an impact to its infrastructure as a result of a wildland-urban interfaced fire.

## 11.2.3 Secondary Impacts
Potential secondary effects of a wildland-urban interfaced fire include utility failure, poor air quality, and hazardous materials spill.

## 11.2.4 Exposure and Vulnerability
A wildland-urban interfaced fire affecting a SMUD owned and operated structure could result in much more than structural damage. Communication systems, energy delivery systems, critical medical services, transportation infrastructure, and all other crucial societal functions powered by energy have potential to be damaged by urban structural fires.

The State Fire Marshal is mandated to classify lands within State Responsibility Areas into Fire Hazard Severity Zones.

The Fire Hazard Severity Zone maps are developed using a
<!-- Page 107 -->
![Fire Hazard Levels in Sacramento County](https://www.example.com/image-url)

Sacramento County is not at high risk, relative to other counties in California, of urban fire hazard (See Figure 14). However, the surrounding counties of Yolo, Solano, San Joaquin, Costa, Placer, and Sutter are all “high” ranked wildfire hazard areas. A wind event combined with a wildfire event in a bordering county would put SMUD at an increased risk for a wildland-urban interfaced fire hazard event.

## 12.0 Water Rise Hazards

This section will cover flood and other water rise hazards collectively. These water rise hazards include:
- Flood and flash floods
- Riverine, stream and alluvial flood hazards
- Sea level rise, coastal flooding, and erosion hazards
- Tsunami and seiche hazards
- Levee failure
- Dam failure

### 12.1 Flood and Flashflood

#### 12.1.1 General Background

Flooding occurs when a body of water rises and overflows onto “normally” dry land. Floods are the most common of all weather-related natural hazards and can happen during heavy rains, when ocean waves come on shore, when snow melts quickly, or when dams and levees break. Flooding can result in significant damage to structures, landscapes, utilities, and human life.

---

88 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 111 -->
# 12.1.2 Hazard Profile

According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Severe Storms Laboratory, “damaging flooding may happen with only a few inches of water, or it may cover a house to the rooftop. Floods can occur within minutes or over a long period, and may last days, weeks, or longer. Floods are the most common and widespread of all weather-related natural disasters.”

Flash floods are the most dangerous kind of floods because they combine the destructive power of a flood with incredible speed. Flash floods occur when heavy rainfall exceeds the ability of the ground to absorb it. They also occur when water fills normally dry creeks or streams or enough water accumulates for streams to overtop their banks, causing rapid rises of water in a short amount of time. They can happen within minutes of the causative rainfall, limiting the time available to warn and protect the public.

## Location

Flooding occurs in every part of the United States (U.S.) and is a catastrophe around the world. In the U.S. floods kill more people each year than tornadoes, hurricanes, or lightning.

Densely populated areas are at a higher risk for flash floods as roadways, buildings and other structures increase runoff by reducing the amount of rain absorbed by the ground.

Most of SMUD’s transmission and power generation infrastructure and equipment are located in areas that are less populated. Most of SMUD’s distribution infrastructure and equipment are located within more densely populated areas. However, SMUD does own transmission in Sacramento County in very urban areas. SMUD’s infrastructure is susceptible to both floods and flash floods.

In addition, Sacramento, where SMUD’s Headquarters Campus and East Campus Operation Center are located, is located by many rivers, lakes, levees, and dams, which have the potential of flooding.

## Frequency and Severity

According to the State of California’s Multi-Hazard Mitigation Plan, flooding is widespread and the second most frequent disaster source in the State. Flooding is the most frequent and costly natural hazard in the United States, a hazard that has caused more than 10,000 deaths since 1900. Approximately 90 percent of presidentially declared disasters result from natural hazard events with flooding as a major component. The Plan Area, specifically Sacramento, has the greatest risk of flooding of any major city in the country.

**12.1.3 Exposure and Vulnerability**  
If flooding were to occur in the Plan Area, impacts could include loss of life, reduction of grid reliability, damage to infrastructure and increased safety risks. Within 6 hours of heavy rain, area rivers and tributaries become swollen and can even begin to overspill their banks in a few places, especially in historically vulnerable locations: small streams, creeks, canals, and drainage ditches tend to overflow. Normally dry gullies or dry creek-beds become alive. In flatter terrain, expanded areas of inundation occur around low-lying spots covering several secondary roads. In urban places, expanded areas of inundation occur at several underpasses or poor drainage spots, with some streets and parking lots taking on moving water. Storm drains and retention ponds overflow. In mountain areas, considerable run-off moving fast down the valley washes out some roads, especially in river valleys. Hillsides vulnerable to erosion become a concern for mudslides. Overall, flash flooding impacts buildings and roads with several evacuations necessary; damage is moderate.

![Flooding, erosion, and debris flows commonly occur in California during periods following large, hot fires. Wildfires greatly reduce the amount of vegetation and affect the soils, which in turn reduces the capabilities for the terrain to absorb rainwater. This effect allows for excessive water runoff that will often carry large amounts of debris. Structures located near a major burn area are most susceptible to flooding. SMUD’s Plan Area has experienced flooding periodically during and following major storms. This is a natural incident, given that the City of Sacramento is located at the confluence of two major rivers. It was commonly believed prior to 1986 that the levees containing the Sacramento River and the American River were of sufficient height and stability to protect the City of Sacramento from 100-year or greater storms. However, the storms that occurred in February 1986 demonstrated that those levees are not sufficient. Not only was the City of Sacramento at risk from the water flowing through the Sacramento and American Rivers, but also from the tributaries and streams that flow into those rivers, particularly Natomas East Main Drainage Canal, Arcade, and Magpie Creeks in the north and Morrison Creek stream group in the south that eventually flows into Beach Lake and returns to the Cosumnes watershed. As a result, the Sacramento Area Flood Control Agency (SAFCA) was formed to work with State and Federal authorities to identify and construct levee improvements and other facilities to provide 200-year level of protection for the City of Sacramento on the American River system. This work is still ongoing. SMUD will likely encounter direct and indirect impacts from sea level rise and flooding in the next several decades. While sea level rise and flooding are each a concern of climate change, the impacts compound in the Sacramento region due to the interconnected nature of snowmelt from the Sierras and ocean access from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta). SAFCA suggests that Sacramento has the greatest risk of flooding when compared to all other cities in the United States. Future Trends in Development Sea level along California’s coast has risen approximately 7 in. in the last century, and this rate is expected to accelerate south of Cape Mendocino 5 – 24 inches (5 in – 2 ft.) by 2050 and 17 – 66 inches (1.4 - 5.5 ft.) by 2100 relative to a 2000 baseline dependent on specific carbon emissions scenarios. With current sea-level rise conditions, the Risky Business Project predicts that roughly $8-$10 billions of existing property in California could be flooded by 2050 with an additional $6-$10 billion susceptible to flooding at high tides.**
<!-- Page 114 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://example.com/image.jpg)

Combined with Sacramento’s particular vulnerability to flooding, sea level rise could have major implications to assets and infrastructure on which SMUD depends.

## 12.2 Riverine, Stream and Alluvial Flood Hazards
According to Sacramento County, numerous parcels and roads throughout the County not included in FEMA-100 and 500-year floodplains are subject to flooding in heavy rains. In addition to flooding, damage to these areas during heavy storms includes pavement deterioration, washouts, mudslides, debris areas, and downed trees. SMUD’s Plan Area is vulnerable to flood (riverine, stream and alluvial), sea-level rise, erosion, tsunami, landslides, severe thunderstorms, and tree mortality. There are many vulnerable public and private assets, crops, vulnerable communities (elderly, children, disabled, etc.), SMUD power assets, water facilities, etc. within SMUD’s Plan Area. If any of the above events were to occur, it could adversely impact first response services provided.

Riverine flooding happens when a watercourse exceeds its “bank-full” capacity. The event is generally a result of prolonged rainfall, or a combination of rainfall and snowmelt. In SMUD’s Plan Area, riverine flooding will occur most often between the months of November and April. The intense storms that happen during these months can overwhelm local waterways and compromise the integrity of flood control structures.

## 12.3 Sea Level Rise, Coastal Flooding and Erosion Hazards
Coastal erosion is a natural geomorphic process. Coastal erosion is accelerated by factors such as winter storms, tidal action, wind-generated high surf, wave action, and rising sea levels. Periods of heavy rain have resulted in the highest sea level readings along California’s coast. Climate change plays a significant role in rising sea levels and may increase the frequency of severe weather and winter storms.

Sea level rising has a significant impact on the environment. If coastal habitats are unable to migrate inland due to rising sea levels, they may become inundated by salt-water intrusion. This will result in land subsidence, a loss of habitat for fish and wildlife, and loss of aesthetic, recreational, and commercial uses.

SMUD has not been impacted by any instances of sea level rise, coastal flooding, or erosion hazards. It is anticipated that with climate change, SMUD could potentially be impacted by this in the future.

## 12.4 Tsunami and Seiche Hazards
A tsunami is a wave triggered by any form of land displacement along the edge or bottom of an ocean or lake. Tsunamis are rare and can quickly put the lives of coastal residents, business, and visitors in jeopardy. California is vulnerable to local and distant tsunamis, but tsunamis are typically more disastrous and threatening because they afford at-risk populations only a few minutes to reach safety.

A seiche is a standing wave in an enclosed or partially enclosed body of water. Seiches have been observed on lakes, reservoirs, bays, harbors and at sea. Seiches could cause damage to

**12.5 Levee Failure**  
A levee failure or breach is classified where a levee partially or completely releases the previously contained water to flood the land behind the levee. The two main reasons for levee breaches are erosion and overtopping. Erosion can be caused by natural elements such as the wind and water, which can create new or worsen existing damage of the levee. A majority of the urban center of Sacramento is dependent on the presence of levees (See Figure 17). A levee failure would be detrimental to SMUD’s Plan Area.

Folsom Dam provides primary flood management for much of Sacramento County. The dam is operated in concert with other major dams on the Yuba, Bear, Feather, and smaller rivers to protect various areas from flooding. Levees protecting Sacramento could fail if water were released from Folsom Dam or other dams which could cause the American River or Sacramento River to rise above the top of the levees. The release capacity of Folsom Dam substantially exceeds the capacity of American River levees, and Sacramento could be flooded to protect the safety of Folsom Dam or other areas. This flood operation decision is the responsibility of the US Army Corps of Engineers.

A major flooding of downtown Sacramento would present great challenges for SMUD. Much of the California government would be without electrical power for many weeks, potentially even longer (months) due to supply chain impacts, first while floodwaters receded and then later while repairing the damage to the underground distribution system and other area assets. Many thousands of downtown employees would not be able to work and would suffer economic hardship. SMUD revenues would be impacted since key business and government customers would be unable to purchase electricity. Damage to highways such as Interstate-5, Interstate-80, State Route 99, US 50, and railroads could prevent shipment of necessary replacement parts like switchgear and transformers as well as preventing telecom companies from repairing their facilities to enable telecommuting.

<!-- Page 116 -->
![Figure 17: 2021 Sacramento County Flood Protection Zones](https://example.com/image-url)

Approximately 150 years ago, the levees of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta were raised to prevent flooding on some of the most fertile farmland in the nation. Levee failure is a high risk to SMUD due to SMUD’s Plan Area being surrounded by a network of 518 miles of levees.

<!-- Page 117 -->
Areas subject to flooding because of a levee breach in SMUD’s service area are adjacent to the Sacramento, Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and American Rivers. In addition, various sloughs, creeks, and other drainage vehicles are subject to flooding. Other areas that flood periodically are low lying. The Sutter and Yolo bypasses afford an appreciable level of flood protection from Sacramento River overflows during the winter and spring months, leaving the American and Cosumnes River as the major slow-rise flood threat. Water from the Sacramento River overflows into these bypasses over the Tisdale, Fremont, and Sacramento Weirs.

The potential of a major, catastrophic levee failure on a major watercourse is like that of a levee overtopping on a secondary stream. The State/Federal River Forecast Center in Sacramento monitors the Sacramento, Cosumnes, Mokelumne, and American Rivers through a series of stations located along the rivers. The system affords a degree of advance flood warning for emergency responders.

## 12.6 Dam Failure
Since the 1850's, hundreds of dams and reservoirs have been built in California. They have been built to provide water for populations and agriculture, to allow for flood control, as a source of hydroelectric power, and for recreation. The storage capacity of these reservoirs ranges from a few hundred acre-feet to 5,000,000 ac-ft. The water from these reservoirs eventually makes its way to the Pacific Ocean through several river systems.

Dam failure is defined as any uncontrolled release of water, and it does not need to be a complete and catastrophic failure of a dam. Depending on the nature of the failure, it can result in a small release of water, or it can lead to catastrophic flooding. Dam failure can be the result of a variety of natural or human-induced factors such as structural failure of the materials constituting the dam and/or spillways, dam overtopping due to flood conditions, earthquakes, sabotage, and inadequate maintenance and monitoring. In the event of a dam failure, the energy of the water stored behind the dam can cause rapid and unexpected flooding downstream, affecting multiple communities and river landscapes, resulting in loss of life and property damage. Secondary effects include loss of water supply or power generation.

SMUD owns the following dams:

| Table 27: SMUD Owned Dams |
|----------------------------|
| Brush Creek Dam            | Loon Lake Dam          |
| Buck Island Dam            | Rancho Seco Dam       |

| Gerle Dam                  | Slab Creek Dam        |
| Ice House Dam              | Union Valley Dam      |

95 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 118 -->
There are several other dams not owned by SMUD, both within and outside SMUD’s plan area, where a catastrophic dam failure would impact SMUD electrical system infrastructure and affect SMUD customers in myriad other ways.

## 12.6.1 Hazard Profile
SMUD’s Plan Area has historically been subject to periodic flooding. Much of the flood risk in SMUD’s Plan Area is a result of heavy rainfall and resulting stream and drainage canal overflows. Figure 18 below is the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) of SMUD’s Plan Area, which shows special hazard areas and risk premium zones, as delineated by FEMA. There have not been any flooding related hazards because of SMUD’s operations.

Flooding resulting from a dam failure can also result from any one or combination of the following causes:
- Earthquake;
- Inadequate spillway capacity resulting in excess overtopping flows;
- Internal erosion caused by embankment or foundation leakage, piping or rodent activity;
- Improper design;
- Negligent operation; and/or
- Failure of upstream dams on the same waterway to name a few.

The California Department of Water Resources (CA DWR) Division of Safety of Dams (DSOD) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Division of Dam Safety and Inspections (D2SI) have dam safety regulatory oversight of SMUD’s dams. They also assign hazard classifications to dams. Existing land use and land use controls (zoning) downstream of the dam are two factors considered in assigning hazard ratings. CA DWR DSOD uses four hazard classification categories:
- Extremely high hazard potential – expected to cause considerable loss of human life or would result in an inundation area with a population of 1,000 or more;
- High hazard potential – expected to cause loss of at least one human life;
- Significant hazard potential – no probable loss of human life but can cause economic loss, environmental damage, impacts to critical facilities, or other significant impacts;
- Low hazard potential – no probable loss of human life and low economic and environmental losses. Losses are expected to be principally limited to the owner’s property.

SMUD owns 6 dams that are designated by CA DWR DSOD as high or extremely high hazard potential dams. They are the Loon Lake, Ice House, Union Valley, Slab Creek, Chili Bar and Rancho Seco Dams. The locations of all SMUD dams can be found in figure 18 below.

<!-- Page 119 -->
![Figure 18: FEMA 100- & 500-Year Flood Plains around SMUD Service Area](https://example.com/image-url)

In addition, dam failures have the potential to cause loss of life, damage to property, and other ensuing hazards, as well as the displacement of persons residing in or near the inundation path. Damage to electric generating facilities and transmission lines could also affect life support systems in communities outside the immediate hazard areas.

**High Hazard Dam Assessment**  
A failure of one or more of SMUD’s high-hazard potential dams would impact communities downstream. Since 2014, all of SMUD’s high-hazard potential dams have had emergency action plans, EAPs. All EAPs and subsequent updates have been approved by the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services as required by Senate Bill 92.

SMUD’s EAPs were developed through collaborative meetings and consultation with local emergency response agencies: the Sacramento County Office of Emergency Services, Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department Herald Fire Protection District, Cosumnes Fire Department, El Dorado County Office of Emergency Services, El Dorado County Sheriff’s Office, Placer County Office of Emergency Services, Placer County Sheriff’s Office and CalFIRE. In addition, California DWR Division of Safety of Dams, FERC D2SI, the National Weather Service, and the California DWR Division of Flood Management were consulted.

<!-- Page 120 -->
![Rancho Seco Inundation Map](https://example.com/path/to/image)  
**Figure 19: Rancho Seco Inundation Map**  

The EAP development process is extensive; it includes the development of technical reports and inundation maps. Figure 19 is an example shown of an inundation map of one of SMUD's high hazard dams, Rancho Seco Dam.

**Frequency and Severity**  
A catastrophic dam failure could exceed the capability of affected emergency response agencies. Damage control and disaster relief support would be required from other local governmental and private organizations, state and federal governments, and other utilities.

While some of SMUD’s dams are located upstream from unpopulated areas and large reservoirs, most are not. Failure of Union Valley Dam, for example, could result in widespread flooding of large parts of Sacramento and cause over 1,000 deaths.  

SMUD continues to minimize the impact of dam failure on the local community by complying with the FERC and Cal OES requirements to engage in EAP activities associated with dam failure. An EAP process is a formal procedure that identifies potential emergency conditions at a dam and results in a series of coordinated actions to be taken by a variety of parties to minimize loss of life and property damage in the event of a dam failure. SMUD’s EAPs include:  

35 SMUD, 2022, Dam Failure Analysis and Inundation Map, Union Valley Dam, available from DWR website  
98 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 121 -->
- A set of procedures SMUD follows to notify downstream emergency management agencies. The sheriff’s office with jurisdiction of the downstream area is responsible for the emergency response. They are aware of the potential for dam failure in their area. Every five years emergency response agencies participate in a dam failure response exercise led by SMUD.
- A set of inundation maps recognize high priority dams to aid emergency management agencies in identification of critical infrastructure and/or communities at risk for warning and evacuation planning.
- A detailed plan of coordination and communication between SMUD and emergency management agencies that will apply in the event of emergencies related to actual dam failure at SMUD’s dams.
- EAPs are routinely reviewed and must be approved by Cal OES, Department of Water Resources Division of Safety of Dams, and FERC Division of Dam Safety and Inspections.

**Past Events**  
None of SMUD’s dams have failed. Table 28 lists recent dam incidents in the Plan Area.

**Table 28: Failure of Spillways and Related Facilities Since 1990**

| Year | Name        | Extent of damage                                      |
|------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1995 | Folsom Dam  | Spillway gate failure. Flooding confined to American River Parkway. |
| 1997 | Folsom Dam  | Holes in floor of the conduit. No flooding occurred. |
| 2017 | Oroville Dam | Evacuation of 180,000 people. $870 MM in damages.   |

**12.7 Current Mitigation Efforts for Water Rise Hazards**  
The DWR Division of Safety of Dams assigns condition assessment ratings to California dams; all SMUD dams were assessed as satisfactory. Satisfactory is the highest rating indicating no existing or potential dam safety deficiencies are recognized. SMUD’s dam safety program continues to monitor, assess, and identify ways to mitigate any future potential impacts from a breach of our dams. For high hazard dams, additional dam performance monitoring and surveillance is performed that is required under licensed requirements.

### 13.0 Earthquakes and Geological Hazards

SMUD’s Plan Area is susceptible to liquefaction, subsidence, landslides, earthquakes, and volcanic activity. Volcanic activity is a potential predecessor/cause of earthquakes whereas subsidence, liquefaction, and landslides can be products of earthquakes. Northern California is at high risk of earthquake and other geological occurrences due to the proximity of the San Andreas Fault system and several nearby volcanoes.

The loss of electric power due to earthquake can occur from many related effects of a violent ground shake. Landslides can damage power line structures (poles/towers), substations, and switchyards. Liquefaction can cause misalignment of the power train of electric plants. Other SMUD assets vulnerable to earthquake damage include natural gas pipelines, liquid storage facilities, water supply systems, dams, communication systems, transportation systems, and disposal systems. Most of these assets rely on electric power. A disruption in the supply of electric power could have extremely detrimental impacts to SMUD and the community. Damages to gas pipelines and excessive flooding could lead to loss of life and economic impact. 

100 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 123 -->
For example, a major earthquake could cause damage and possible failure of Nimbus and/or Folsom Dam. Evacuation of persons in the inundation area would be necessary. The damage and/or possible failure of either dam could severely damage SMUD’s energy system. It is not feasible to accurately forecast the severity of such an incident.

Power outages or power reductions can be expected throughout SMUD’s service area. Downed power lines are a potential hazard and could complicate emergency response efforts. Substations and other portions of the infrastructure, especially the underground equipment, may be particularly susceptible to damage. Administrative facilities may be subject to damage. In addition, transmission facilities outside the service area may be damaged and limit the import capabilities, thus limiting the total amount of energy available for distribution and other operations. Generation facilities may experience interruptions or may be taken offline due to shaking or loss of load.

The immediate physical, emotional, and social impact on the population would be varied and complex. In the hardest hit areas, there could be deaths and many injuries. Many could have their homes destroyed, others driven from their homes by the lack of water and/or power, leaking gas, flooding and so on.

### 13.1 Earthquake
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) describes an earthquake as both the sudden slip on an active fault and the resulting shaking and radiated seismic energy caused by the slip. Liquefaction can be a secondary effect of seismic activity on specific types of soil. This could result in differential settlement, dam failures, landslides, tsunamis, and loss of critical infrastructure. Human life is also at high risk during an earthquake event. Earthquakes represent the most destructive source of hazards, risk, and vulnerability, in terms of both recent state history and the probability of future destruction of greater magnitudes than previously recorded.

### 13.1.1 Hazard Profile
**Location**  
California is vulnerable to earthquakes because the state sits atop the boundary between two of the earth’s tectonic plates, the Pacific Plate, and the North American Plate. These two plates are constantly moving at a relative rate of two inches per year. The primary boundary between these two plates is the San Andreas Fault, which is more than 650 miles long and extends to depths of at least 10 miles. Many other small faults such as the Hayward and Calaveras faults branch from and join the San Andreas Fault zone. According to the most recent information provided by the California Earthquake Authority, there is greater than a 99% chance that a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake capable of causing extensive damage and loss of life will occur in California within the next 30 years. Moreover, minor earthquakes not associated with faults occur weekly.

**Frequency and Severity**  
There are several faults known to exist within or near SMUD’s Plan Area that could affect SMUD’s energy system. In the eastern part of Sacramento County, the Bear Mountain and

Melones Faults are found. They are believed to have been inactive for the past 150 million years. The Bear Mountain Fault passes beneath the west end of Folsom Lake.

No faults are currently known to exist within the City of Sacramento portion of the County. It should be noted that significant earthquakes have occurred on previously undetected faults. Although no faults exist there, Sacramento does feel residue from ground shaking because of radiated seismic energy.

The threat of earthquake damage in SMUD’s Plan Area comes from earthquakes along Northern California's major faults, which are the Green Valley, San Andreas, Calaveras, and Hayward faults. A major earthquake on any of these faults could cause shaking within the Plan Area to an intensity of V to VIII on the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, which means damage might be expected only in poorly built structures. Assets closer to the fault will experience stronger intensity than those further away.

SMUD’s operations depend on infrastructure which is owned and/or operated within the regions of the Delta, Sierra Nevada and Greater Sacramento areas, Greater Bay Area, and the Shasta Cascade as defined by the California Earthquake Authority.

The Plan Area has a high risk of a major earthquake (7.0 magnitude or higher) occurring within 50km in the next 30 years, approximately 77%37.

A major earthquake that impacts SMUD’s Plan Area could cause a great many casualties, extensive property damage, fires, flooding, and other types of hazards. The effects of an earthquake could be aggravated by aftershocks and by the secondary effects of fire, landslides, and dam failure. The time of day and season of the year could potentially also have a profound impact on the number of fatalities and/or injuries and the amount of damage sustained. Such an earthquake could be catastrophic in its effect on the population and could exceed the response capability of the state and local communities. Damage control and disaster relief support would be required from other local governmental and private organizations, state and federal governments, and other utilities.

Extensive research and rescue operations may be required to assist trapped or injured persons. Emergency medical care, food, and temporary shelter would be required for injured or displaced persons. Following an earthquake, mass evacuation may be essential to save lives, particularly in areas below dams. Emergency operations could be seriously hampered by the loss of communications and damage to transportation routes within, and to and from, the disaster area(s) and by the disruption of public utilities and services. Figure 20 shows the relative intensity of ground shaking potential in SMUD’s Plan Area from anticipated future earthquakes.

**13.2 Fault Rupture**

A fault rupture occurs when one segment of the earth’s crust slides past another and a store of elastic energy is released as an earthquake. The resulting fracture is referred to as a fault. The sliding of the segments of earth on either side of the fault is referred to as the rupture. The fault rupture, aside from releasing an earthquake, can damage any structures or utility infrastructure around it, as the earth’s surface becomes displaced.

**Frequency and Severity**

No major, active faults traverse SMUD’s Plan Area. However, there is a multitude of subsurface faults in the Delta. Additionally, active faults do exist near SMUD’s Plan Area that could have a detrimental impact on SMUD’s infrastructure if a high intensity earthquake event were to take place (see Table 31). Table 32 shows the active faults by county.

A fault rupture, causing an earthquake event, can lead to many detrimental residual hazards. Relative to the rest of the state of California, SMUD is at a low risk for the likelihood of a fault rupture and its residual effects (See Figure 22). Nonetheless, SMUD still has assets that remain vulnerable to shaking from fault ruptures among active faults in California and Nevada, as well as earthquakes not associated with fault rupture. Failure of these assets could lead to loss of both life and crucial infrastructure in SMUD’s Plan Area.

# 13.3 Liquefaction
Liquefaction is one of the potential hazards that is a secondary effect of an earthquake. Liquefaction occurs when seismic ground shaking suddenly temporarily causes saturated soil to lose strength and firmness. Material that is normally solid begins to behave as a dense liquid. The effect is similar to a structure on quicksand. If the liquefied layer is on the subsurface, structures upon it will begin to move laterally.

Liquefaction is most likely to occur in areas where the groundwater level is shallow.

## 13.3.1 Hazard Profile
### Location
Conditions such as liquefaction are most common in areas where alluvial soil is present. Alluvial soil is most prevalent in places where sandy sediments have been deposited by rivers, in moderate to large canyons, and areas in which wave action has deposited sediment along a beach. Bridges, wharves, piers, and underwater utility lines are most susceptible to the negative impacts of liquefaction.

In SMUD’s Plan Area, the Delta and downtown Sacramento are at the greatest risk to liquefaction. Though SMUD’s Plan Area has not endured any major earthquake events in recent history, there are at least five faults that lie near the Delta that can generate peak ground acceleration. The 1,100 miles of levees that surround the Delta may become unstable under seismic loading. The presence of sand and silt in the levees make liquefaction a very high possibility.

# 13.4 Subsidence
Subsidence is a sinking of the ground. More specifically, it is deemed as “movement in which there is no free side and surface material is displaced vertically downward with little or no horizontal component.”

## 13.4.1 Hazard Profile
### Location
SMUD’s Plan Area is affected by some unique types of subsidence. The types of subsidence include:
- Earthquake-induced subsidence. This type of subsidence occurs when earthquake shaking causes the compaction of unconsolidated soils.
- Subsidence due to compaction by heavy structures. The Delta levees subside, in part, because of their own weight.
- Subsidence due to wind erosion of peat soils in the Delta.
- Subsidence due to fluid withdrawal. The removal of oil and gas in the Delta has caused some slight subsidence of soils in the Delta. Water withdrawal has been a much more important problem in Sacramento County.
- Subsidence due to peat oxidation in the Delta.

107 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 130 -->
![Figure 23: Known and Potential Subsidence Areas in Sacramento County](https://example.com/image-url)

**Frequency and Severity**  
Subsidence due to peat oxidation occurs in the Delta. Farmers drain the surface of the soil to plant and plow. When the peat dries out, aerobic bacteria can feed on the peat and convert it to carbon dioxide and other gaseous substances in a process called peat oxidation. Gradually, the peat is disappearing to the bacteria.

The subsidence in the Delta has caused problems for flood control because it places increasing pressure on the levees. These levees keep the surrounding water from inundating lower areas. The increasing hydrostatic pressure caused by the subsidence weakens the levees, necessitating periodic rebuilding. In terms of economic costs, subsidence makes flood protection increasingly expensive.

![Past Events](https://via.placeholder.com/150)  
**Past Events**  
SMUD anticipates that within its Plan Area, if there continues to be drier climates, which removes water from the ground, making it dry, there will be increased risk of subsidence. To date, SMUD has not been impacted by subsidence.  

There are no SMUD administrative facilities known to be in areas of existing, ongoing, or potential subsidence. Earth movement and sinking has developed at some substation sites. These conditions have been corrected.  

### 13.5 Landslides  
The Plan Area is susceptible to landslides. Landslide refers to a variety of slope instabilities that result in the downward and outward movement of slope-forming materials including rocks, soil, and artificial fill.  

#### 13.5.1 Hazard Profile  
**Location**  
Most landslides occur during rainy months when soil is saturated with water. Winter storms with intense rainfalls are the most common trigger for landslides. Masses of rock and soils can become detached from steep slopes or cliffs because of earthquakes, flooding, and/or drought and is strongly influenced by gravity, weathering, undercutting, or erosion. Rotational slides caused by the earth movements create a concaved upward movement of soil. This usually results in a bulging “toe” made of the slid material at the bottom of the slide. These types of land movement could cause significant damage to roads, leaving them unsafe to travel on.  

Landslide impacts are geographically limited to the area where the slide occurs and are primarily associated with mountainous regions. The potential for larger slides in SMUD’s Plan Area exists in the UARP and other mountainous regions. The primary factors that could cause or increase the likelihood of landslides for SMUD are:  
- Naturally occurring geological movement including rainfall, water action, seismic, and volcanic activities.  
- Excavation and grading on sloping ground for homes, roads, and other structures.  
- Drainage and groundwater alterations or breaches.  
- Change or removal of vegetation located on steep slopes.  

**Frequency and Severity**  
Landslides can occur throughout the Plan Area, though more tend to occur in areas with steeper slopes, weaker geology, and high annual precipitation. Landslides may result from several things including natural and human-caused changes in the environment such as heavy rain, rapid snow melt, steepening of slopes due to construction or erosion, earthquakes, changes in groundwater levels and deforestation caused by wildfires. There have been incidents of landslides and general slope failure in isolated portions of El Dorado County, but it is an uncommon occurrence with no defined history of significant damages.  

109 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 132 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan](https://example.com/image.jpg)

A more detailed landslide hazard assessment requires a site-specific analysis of the slope, soil, rock, vegetation, and groundwater characteristics. Such assessments are often conducted prior to major development projects in areas with moderate to high landslide potential, to evaluate the specific hazard at the development site. SMUD does not have sufficient information to determine the extent of landslides in its Plan Area. It has not been impacted by such an event.

## 13.6 Volcanoes

Volcanic eruptions are one of Earth's most dramatic and violent agents of change. Not only can powerful explosive eruptions drastically alter land and water for tens of kilometers around a volcano, but tiny liquid droplets of sulfuric acid erupted into the stratosphere can change our planet's climate temporarily.

### 13.6.1 Hazard Profile

**Frequency and Severity**  
The principal hazards to people in the Pacific Northwest are from lahars and ash fall. Lahars (volcanic mudflows) can destroy buildings and infrastructure. Eruptions that include volcanic ash can be especially dangerous for aircraft, even at long distances from the volcano because volcanic ash can clog and shut down their engines. Explosive eruptions of volcanic particles are followed by effusion of lava flows. High-speed avalanches of hot rock and gas can accompany columns of tephra collapse or the fronts of lava flows crumble, both of which can send pyroclastics flowing down the volcano's flanks. Finally, when the erupted material mixes with river water or melts snow and ice, volcanic mudflows sweep down valleys and can devastate areas more than 50 miles downstream. Rivers can continue to carry volcanic sediment downstream and force flooding for decades to hundreds of years. The most significant threats are from volcanic ash and from the slurry of mud and debris within lahars. Even in the absence of eruption, the flanks of Cascade volcanoes can collapse, which result in landslides and debris avalanches that can destroy areas downslope from the collapse location.

Volcanoes pose multiple types of hazards, and the initiation and duration of eruptions is relatively uncertain. Therefore, authorities and populations at risk, both close to and far from the volcano, must be knowledgeable about volcanic hazards so that they can be flexible and prepared in their response.

Eruptions often force people living near volcanoes to abandon their land and homes, sometimes forever. Those living farther away are likely to avoid complete destruction, but their cities and towns, crops, industrial plants, transportation systems, and electrical grids can still be damaged by tephra, ash, lahars, and flooding.

Fortunately, volcanoes exhibit precursory unrest that, when detected and analyzed in time, allows eruptions to be anticipated and communities at risk to be forewarned. The warning time preceding volcanic events typically allows sufficient time for affected communities to implement response plans and mitigation measures.

![Hazard Mitigation Plan](https://example.com/image.png)

Hazard response and coordination plans are multi-agency efforts that define the responsibilities and actions to take in the event of a restless or active volcano. Scientists from the five regional volcanic observatories of the USGS Volcano Hazards Program participate in developing these plans with state and local governments of at-risk areas. If volcanic unrest or an eruption occurs, scientists from the observatories will keep state and local officials informed of potential hazards so that coordination and response plans can be updated as needed.

## 13.7 Current Mitigation Efforts for Geological Hazards
SMUD’s mitigation efforts for earthquake and geological hazards events are uniform with the requirements of the State of California. A list of current mitigation activities is depicted in table 34 below.

### Table 34: Current Geological Hazards Mitigation

| Mitigation                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mapping                          | SMUD has identified all site-specific earthquake hazards and has created an identification map with operational emergency processes for the recognized seismic events that could occur, could trigger reinspction of certain assets as appropriate. |
| Adhering to codes                | SMUD follows all current building codes and makes regular structural improvements to its facilities. Critical facilities are subject to more scrutinizing and innovative regulations and mitigation measures.                       |
| Vulnerability assessment          | SMUD regularly assesses its water supply, oil, and natural gas pipelines for potential failure during an earthquake event. SMUD’s high hazard potential and significant hazard potential dams in the UARP are inspected annually with FERC and DSOD. All dams were found to not fail according to the guidelines. |
| EOC                              | SMUD maintains an EOC to help coordinate real-time incident command, response, and recovery from all emergencies, including those resulting from hazards.                                                                          |
| Supplier joint-response agreement | Since much of SMUD’s critical assets and replacement parts are unique or made to order and the lead-time for manufacturing and delivery of these materials could take up to a year, it is important for the continued operation of the power grid to maintain the health and safety of our community, to participate in a supplier joint response coordination. The coordination allows SMUD to borrow from participating utilities and suppliers, key assets for immediate use. |
| Gap analysis                     | SMUD actively practices identification of gaps in current response plans for earthquake events and revises them regularly.                                                                                                      |
| Proper equipment                 | SMUD utilizes flexible piping, flexible couplings, and above ground fault crossings.                                                                                                                                           |
| Generators                       | SMUD utilizes generators in case of power failure.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Training for safe restoration     | SMUD trains customers how to reset breakers to help restore electrical power.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Regional agency response coordination | Focus on active participation in city, county, and state emergency management structures for assuring coordinated responses to emergencies.                                                                                     |

14.0 Severe Weather and Storms  
Severe weather is a weather event that is beyond the range of commonly observed weather patterns in a geographic area. In the SMUD Plan Area, the usual events could include extreme heat, heavy rain, hail, lightning, and strong winds. The full possibility of weather events includes rainfall events, heat waves, storms, unusually cold temperatures, and wind events. California is projected to endure an increase in severe weather events due to climate change.

Severe weather can be viewed in four phases (see table 35) to communicate and coordinate with local agencies, mobilize necessary resources, and support local agencies in recovery efforts.

**Table 35: Severe Weather Guidance**  
| Phase | Category | Suggested Criteria | Critical Criteria |
|-------|----------|--------------------|-------------------|
| I     | Seasonal readiness | On-set of summer and winter | Cooler months: Nov-Feb<br>Warmer months: Jun-Aug |
| II    | Increased readiness | Warmer or cooler than normal credible weather predictions | Potential for prolonged abnormal weather conditions and possibility of weather-related power outages. |
| III   | Severe weather alert | Credible forecasts of excessively hot or cold weather conditions: daytime temps for a duration accompanied by specific nighttime temps | Heat: excessively hot weather for three days accompanied by night temps of 75°F or more.<br>Cold: extreme cold/freezing warning or wind chill warnings indicating extreme weather conditions for three days accompanied by night temps of 32°F or less. |
| IV    | Severe weather emergency | Extreme weather conditions that could potentially have a life-threatening impact on the population, animals, and agriculture | Heat: heat index of over 105°F with credible weather forecasts of excessively hot weather for more than three days accompanied by night temps of 75°F or more.<br>Cold: extreme cold/freezing warnings or wind chill warnings indicating weather conditions that endanger human life with credible weather forecasts of extremely cold/freezing weather for more than three days accompanied by night temps of 32°F or less. |

14.1 Extreme Heat  
In the Plan Area, an extreme heat day is defined as a day between April and October in which the maximum temperature exceeds the historical 98th percentile of maximum temperatures for that given day. Cal-Adapt, a web-based climate adaptation planning tool developed by the California Energy Commission defines an extreme heat day, specific to SMUD’s plan region as one that exceeds 100°F. SMUD’s concern is the impact of extreme heat.

**Frequency and Severity**  
Extreme heat has always been a characteristic of the Sacramento region and the surrounding areas. However, extreme heat events are now projected to increase in regularity throughout the state of California because of climate change. The heat events are projected to be of a greater intensity, longer duration, and influence a broader geographic area. Average night-time temperatures, especially important for public health and infrastructure, are projected to increase even faster than daytime averages.

Extreme heat can also be accompanied by increased humidity. Extreme heat combined with increased humidity can pose a serious threat to human life and the longevity of infrastructure in SMUD’s Plan Area. A series of extreme heat days occurring consecutively is referred to as an extreme heat event. As climate change continues to affect SMUD’s Plan Area, heat events are becoming more prevalent.

The National Weather Service has implemented Impact-Based Decision Support Services (IDSS) which provides improved reporting of heat risk in the SMUD Plan Area. IDSS

Extreme heat ranks as among the deadliest of all natural hazards. Humidity and extreme heat can provoke a quantity of natural hazards such as dust storms and drought. High temperatures usually coincide with low humidity. High temperatures generally contribute to the evaporation of surface water and moisture from the soil causing the soil to become loose and easier to be carried away by wind. As temperatures increase, it may overload demands for electricity to run air conditioners in homes and businesses.

Extreme heat tends to not affect infrastructure, as heat events are generally limited in length. Infrastructure gets relief between hot and cool temperature cycles. SMUD’s biggest points of vulnerability are, given an extreme heat event, an overload demand for electricity to run air conditioners in homes and businesses and the safety of its employees in the field.

Extreme heat is harmful to the population and employees in SMUD’s Plan Area. In California, heat-related events annually send 4,300 people to the emergency room and hospitalize an additional 600 for stays longer than one day. In 2006, during one of California’s worst heatwaves, 203 deaths were attributed to heat-related events.

The populations that are most vulnerable to heat-related events include the homeless, infants and children under age five, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, individuals dependent on medical equipment, and individuals with impaired mobility.

**Past Events**  
The Plan Area temperatures could range from moderate to extremely high heat. The warmest times of the year are typically the late summer and early fall. The Plan Area has suffered occasional heat events. The sudden spike in temperature has a great impact on residents inside and outside the Plan Area and could affect the electric grid. Table 37 depicts available data found for the most recent excess heat events in the NCDC database for the Plan Area.

**14.2 Freeze**  
Extreme cold and freeze is most likely to occur during the winter months, and often accompanies a winter storm. Sustained freezes can cause life loss and health risks to vulnerable populations. Economically, freezes can severely affect agriculture in SMUD’s Plan Area, which affects farmers, farm workers, packers, and shippers of agricultural products. Freezes can also cause significant increases in food prices to the consumer due to shortages.

117 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 140 -->
The NCDC has recorded 22 freeze incidents in SMUD’s Plan Area since 1993, resulting in $200,000 in property damage and $5MM in crop damage. In 2013, a six-day freeze event caused more than $440MM in damage to citrus crops throughout the state. Freezes are likely to become less frequent in California as climate change increases average temperatures.

**Exposure and Vulnerability**  
Exposure to extreme cold and freeze may be life threatening since it can cause frostbite or hypothermia. The populations most susceptible to the dangers of freeze are infants and the elderly. Regarding infrastructure, pipes may freeze and burst in homes or businesses that have poor insulation; ice can also form on power lines which could weigh powerlines down, stressing and damaging it. In the most extreme of conditions, freezes can impair communication facilities in SMUD’s Plan Area. If freeze is intermixed with warm weather cycles, it may result in an increase in avalanche risk.

**14.3 Fog**  
Fog is formed when ice crystals and/or water droplets collect, suspended in the air at the earth’s surface. This occurs when the air is cooled to the point that it can no longer contain all the water vapor it has accumulated. In Sacramento, fog season occurs in the late fall and winter. Fog typically forms in the early morning hours, and it can and will last several days at a time.

**Table 38: Fog Events in Sacramento County**

It is currently unclear if climate change will have a future effect on fog in the Sacramento area. However, decreasing emissions in the air in response to climate change has resulted in a decline in winter fog events over recent decades. 

Fog in the Sacramento area can reduce visibility to mere feet. This can lead to multi-car accidents and have devastating effects on transportation corridors. Severe fog can close roads, cause accidents, and impair the effectiveness of emergency responders. Electric infrastructure along roadways is at risk of accident-related damage. In addition, SMUD’s employees are required to drive heavy equipment to conduct work. Increased fog increases risks for drivers and electric workers by limiting visibility. Considering that most of SMUD’s Plan Area sits within a valley, it is at risk for dense fog. There is not enough data to determine specific potential extent of fog in SMUD’s Plan Area.

### 14.4 Severe Storms, Hail and Lightning
A thunderstorm is considered severe when it either contains three-quarters of an in-sized hail or winds more than 57.5 miles per hour (mph) - this includes tornadoes. Severe storm events are most prominent during the fall, winter, and spring. Sacramento County averages 18.14 in. of rainfall per year.

Hail is created when water droplets are carried upwards, above the freezing level. The droplets freeze, becoming too heavy for the updraft to carry, and fall to the ground. Hail is usually less than two in. in diameter, but it can fall at speeds of 120 mph.

Lightning is a visible electrical discharge caused by a thunderstorm. Lightning can strike as far as five to ten miles from the storm, in areas authorities may not consider to be a direct threat.

| **Table 39: Severe Weather Events in Sacramento County Since 1950** |
|----------------|--------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **Event Type** | **Number of Events** | **Deaths** | **Injuries** | **Property Damage** | **Crop Damage** |
| Hail           | 9      | 0      | 0             | $111,030     | $0           |
| Heavy rain     | 28     | 0      | 1             | $365,000     | $50,000      |
| Lightning      | 1      | 0      | 0             | $150,000     | $0           |

### Exposure and Vulnerability
Severe storms can cause flooding as well as drainage issues in the Sacramento area. Severe storms also put many assets at risk, as flooding combined with strong winds can result in the failure of very mature trees and other geological hazards.

Hailstorms can destroy roofs, buildings, automobiles, vegetation, and SMUD assets.

Lighting can kill or injure employees and people in SMUD’s Plan Area. Assets and infrastructure can also be struck directly. These strikes could result in a burn, explosion, or destruction. Lightning can also lead to wildfire if it strikes the surface in a dry region with vegetation high in fuel.

## 14.5 High Winds and Tornadoes
The National Weather Service (NWS) defines high winds as sustained wind speeds of 40 mph or greater lasting for one hour or longer, or winds of 58 mph or greater for any duration.

High winds can lead to funnel clouds and tornadoes during severe storms. Damages from tornadoes are a result of high wind velocity and wind-blown debris accompanied by lightning or large hail. Each year, an average of 800 tornadoes occurs nationwide, resulting in an average of 80 deaths and 1,500 injuries.57

### 14.5.1 Hazard Profile
Wind speeds during a tornado can reach 300 mph. Unlike hurricanes, which can also produce such wind speeds over great geographic areas, tornadoes are confined to much smaller areas over short distances. SMUD’s Plan Area is at a low risk for tornadoes, relative to the rest of the United States. When tornadoes have occurred historically, they have done so at low intensity on the Fujita Tornado Scale58. However, if a tornado were to affect the area, it would most likely be in the late fall or early spring.

### Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD’s Plan Area is at a low risk of hazardous levels of high winds, relative to other areas of the country (see figure 27). However, high winds are a seasonal occurrence that will continue to occur annually in the Plan Area.

**Past Events**  
Fallen trees from high winds in SMUD’s Plan Area can damage buildings as well as critical structures, including electrical overhead lines, leading to secondary impacts from fire and power outage as well as serious injury to staff or the public and potential death. The most recent high wind and storm events occurred from late December 2022 to January 2023 causing fallen trees and power outages in SMUD service territory. A selection of recorded high wind events can be found in table 40 below.

High winds, particularly those accompanying severe storms, can result in significant property and crop damage. Most hazardous to SMUD’s Plan Area, high winds can exacerbate existing weather conditions and increase the speed at which wildfire travels. Through the damage of roofs and structures, or residual damage caused by fire, winds can have a serious impact on the functional operation of SMUD assets.

High winds can result in power loss and business closures. Winds can also affect fog, dust, and snowstorms. Wind events have caused greater than $14MM in damage in SMUD’s Plan Area since 1955 (see Table 41).

Tornadoes have similar damaging potential to that of high winds. A tornado is likely to damage buildings, cause trees to fall, damage power lines, break gas lines, break sewer and water mains, and cause fires. Access to hazard recovery might also become impaired due to a tornado, as roads can be destroyed or blocked by debris.

While there are incidents of tornadoes in SMUD’s Plan Area, it poses a relatively low risk for most of the area compared to states located in the Midwest and South of the nation. The Plan Area is subject to strong winds associated with powerful winter cold fronts. Strong winds because of tornadoes could have an impact on reliability, could cause increased risk of fires and cause damages to SMUD infrastructure.

### 14.7 Tree Mortality
Tree mortality refers to the death of trees due to factors such as drought-induced water stress, insect attacks, and high tree density. 

125 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 148 -->
# 14.7.1 Hazard Profile

## Frequency and Severity
Increased tree mortality elevates fuel loads, creates hazardous conditions for firefighting personnel, decreases production rates of fire line construction, poses risk of injury and damage from falling branches, and financially impacts property owners. From 2010-2022, 208.6 million trees have died in California. This frequency is expected to increase due to continued climate change. A growth in the rate of tree mortality can affect local, regional, and global carbon budgets. Table 44 below depicts the estimated number of trees that have died each year since 2010.

## Past Events

**14.7.2 Exposure and Vulnerability**  
Increased wildfire risk associated with tree mortality has resulted in a major reorganization of the forest’s ecosystem. SMUD’s Plan Area is expected to see a decline in forest productivity, a change in species composition, a shift to smaller sized trees, and a reduction in forest extent in some regions. There is no data to show how many trees in SMUD’s Plan Area are dead and/or dying. SMUD does not record the number of trees that it removes as a result of tree mortality. Its vegetation management program removes trees under and adjacent to transmission and distribution lines to increase safety, reliability, and decrease wildfire risks.

15.0 Energy Shortage  
15.1 Background  
15.1.1 Hazard Profile  
Delivery of electricity service in SMUD’s Plan Area has been consistently and highly reliable for most of the century-long development, expansion, and continuous operation of grids across all regions of the Nation. The traditional definition of reliability—based on the frequency, duration, and extent of power outages—may be insufficient to ensure system integrity and available electric power in the face of climate change, natural hazards, physical attacks, cyber threats, and other intentional or accidental damage; the security of the system, particularly cybersecurity, is a growing concern.

Resilience is the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions, as well as the ability to withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions, whether deliberate, accidental, or naturally occurring. While resilience is related to aspects of both reliability and security, it incorporates a dynamic response capability to reduce the magnitude and duration of energy service disruptions under stressful conditions. Infrastructure planning and investment strategies that account for resilience typically broaden the range of risk-

### 15.1.2 Exposure and Vulnerability
Changes in the climate are expected to bring more frequent and extreme weather conditions. Extreme weather conditions have the potential to decrease the efficiency of thermal power plants and substations, decrease the capacity of transmission lines, render hydropower less reliable, spur an increase in electricity demand, and put energy infrastructure at risk of flooding and fire. Similarly, during cold spells, heating demands increase, further stressing the energy infrastructure.

The Sacramento area faced historic storms from New Year’s Eve to the early weeks of January 2023, with severe rain, 70-mph winds, and lightning, leading to significant damage and unprecedented power outages. Over 599,000 customers experienced power outages during that period. Additionally, there were 300+ power poles that fell, 1,800 wires down, and 650 downed and broken trees.

### 15.1.3 Current Mitigation Efforts
SMUD considers several natural hazards during the planning, construction and maintenance stages of its equipment and infrastructure. This may result in new equipment standards, environmental reviews, and risk assessments to help reduce the impacts of the natural hazards on new or existing infrastructure locations. SMUD periodically reviews and revises its projections of long-term energy demand against State requirements as a part of plan for expansion of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities.

# 16.0 Climate Change

## 16.1 Background
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) defines climate change as the change in the usual weather conditions and patterns found in a region. More specifically, it is a change in the average weather conditions such as temperature, rainfall, snow, ocean, and atmospheric circulation, or in the distribution of weather around the globe. According to NASA, scientists think that the Earth’s temperature will keep increasing for the next 100 years. “This would cause more snow and ice to melt. Oceans would rise higher. Some places would get hotter. Other places might have colder winters with more snow. Some places might get more rain. Other places might get less rain.” 

California has already been experiencing the impacts of climate change including prolonged droughts, increased coastal flooding and erosion and tree mortality. The state has also seen increased average temperatures, more extreme heat days,
<!-- Page 153 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://www.bmz.de/en/publications/type_of_publication/weitere_materialien/Implications_for_Energy_Briefing_WEB_EN.pdf)

**hazards include the loss of life and injury, damaged infrastructure, long-term health effects, loss of agricultural crops, disrupted transport, and freight, and much more.**

From an operations perspective, climate change means rising energy demand and falling generation and distribution efficiency for the energy sector. Higher ambient temperatures will increase energy demand during the peak summer months by driving use of air conditioning. Rising temperatures will also decrease the efficiency of thermal conversions, meaning that more resources will be required to produce the same amount of energy. In addition to higher temperatures, climate change may bring increased frequency and severity of major weather events, which pose a threat to infrastructure. Changing weather patterns may also affect solar-, wind-, and hydropower generation.

SMUD is an industry leader in innovation and progress in California’s effort to reduce greenhouse gases and prepare for climate changes. In 2012, SMUD produced its first targeted climate readiness study and adaptation strategy. The review included a “state of the science” assessment to update scientific findings and incorporate lessons from the California Climate Adaptation Strategy, Adaptation Policy Guide, and numerous other resources. The climate readiness study and adaptation strategy are an integrated plan for addressing climate change. The analysis gives SMUD an opportunity to critically assess climate change risks and strategy and improve its readiness efforts, while providing a venue for sharing and learning best practices, providing transparency to the community, and building on local efforts with other public and private organizations. The study was updated in 2016 to include a Readiness Action Plan that addresses community engagement, enterprise programs, capital projects, and operational initiatives. In 2021, SMUD took a step further by releasing its 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. The plan details the goal of eliminating carbon emissions from power generation by 2030. SMUD has many programs supporting the equitable transformation to clean energy, including building and transportation electrification incentives, electric vehicle test drives, and partnerships to develop new technologies and strengthen the renewable energy grid.

- Leveraging the best available climate science to make decisions, updating the “state of the science” assessment every four years.
- Continuing to collaborate with multiple local agencies on flood data analysis and preparedness planning.
- Taking proactive measures to make SMUD more resilient.
- Conducting research into the impacts of sustainable forest management techniques on wildfire risk reduction and stream flows.
- Identifying systematic opportunities to integrate climate change projections in internal program planning and capital budget development and approval.
- Investigating opportunities to employ resiliency bonds to finance further readiness measures.
- Supporting and participating in the Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative to assist public and private partners in the region improve overall climate readiness.
- Continuing implementation of the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.

### 17.0 Threat and Social Disturbance Hazards
Threat and disturbance address a symptom of and a form of protest against unfavored decisions. The severity of these actions coincides with the level of public outrage; it could range from blocking or impeding access to a building and disrupting normal activities by generating noise and intimidating people to a full-scale riot that destroys property and terrorizes individuals.

132 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 155 -->
# 17.1 Terrorism

The Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) defines terrorism as “the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives (28 C.F.R. Section 0.85). Terrorism refers to human-caused hazards and their use of weapons of mass destruction: biological, chemical, nuclear, and radiological weapons, arson, incendiary, explosive and armed attacks, or any devices or vehicles that can be used to cause destruction and/or casualties. Terrorism also includes industrial sabotage, intentional hazardous materials releases, and cyber terrorism. Terrorists have a desired objective to target large public gatherings, water and food supplies, utilities and corporate centers, and communication capabilities.

The three key elements to defining a terrorist event are as follows:
- Activities involve the use of illegal force,
- Actions are intended to intimidate or coerce, and
- Actions are committed in support of political or social objectives.

## 17.1.1 Hazard Profile

The following (see Table 48) are potential methods used by terrorists that could directly or indirectly impact SMUD’s Plan Area:

### Table 48: Potential Methods of Terrorist Attacks

| Active Shooter                | Arson                       |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Explosive detonation          | Biological agent release     |
| Chemical agent release        | Cyber terrorism              |
| Kidnapping/Hostage-Taking     | Nuclear Detonation           |
| Radiological incident         | Vehicle Ramming Attack       |

**Frequency and Severity**

SMUD owns critical infrastructures as defined by the Department of Homeland Security. These critical infrastructures are more vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Since September 11, 2001, the number of threats involving the use of chemical, nuclear, or biological agents by individuals and terrorist groups wishing to instill fear and disrupt communities within the United States has escalated. However, to date, SMUD has not experienced a known high-profile attack by groups or individuals associated with international terrorist organizations. Nor has SMUD experienced an incident involving a biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear weapon. Nevertheless, domestic terrorist incidents such as the December 3, 2022, Moore County NC Substation Ballistic Attack have led to heightened security efforts for the Plan Area.

An explosive or electromagnetic pulse detonation occurring anywhere in California could have a critical impact on SMUD’s energy system and/or its ability to maintain continuity in electric service. A targeted attack on SMUD could result in catastrophic damages to its energy infrastructure.

![Electric System Hazard Mitigation](https://example.com/image.png)

**Electric System Hazard Mitigation**

Damage to SMUD’s power plants and ancillary facilities in affected areas can be expected to reduce generating capacity significantly. The potential impact of this reduction in local output is lessened by the availability of power from other sources outside the affected area and by relational reduction in consumer demand. Immediate concerns will focus on repairs necessary to restore power to areas of greatest need. Major restoration problems include supplying chain disruptions, repairs necessary to route power through the major substations, restoration of damaged and collapsed transmission line towers, re-activation of equipment at local substations, replacement of fallen poles, burned transformers, etc. The following table depicts SMUD’s current mitigation efforts of terrorism hazards.

### 17.2 Cyber Threats
Cyber threats are attempts by criminals to attack a government, organization, or private party by damaging or disrupting a computer or computer network, or by gaining unauthorized access to information on a computer or computer network for malicious use.

#### 17.2.1 Hazard Profile
**Exposure and Vulnerability**  
Cyber based attacks gain access to or intrude on critical infrastructure systems, such as financial services, communications systems, energy, or transportation systems, with the potential to alter their reliable functioning. Disruption to such SMUD’s systems could pose a critical threat to local and national security. Over the past years, the threat from cyber terror has grown exponentially in part due to the rapid growth in the use of the Internet and the rapid growth of technology in general. SMUD collects employee, customer, and vendor information on a continuous basis (e.g., job applications, new customer applications, loan forms) for business operations. As SMUD’s electric grid and computer systems become more and more interconnected, and with the increased adoption of new technology (including cloud computing, big data, and mobile device usage), the risk for cyber breach increases.

**Past Events**  
According to Statista, in 2022, there were 1,802 cases of data compromises in the United States where 422 million individuals were affected in the same year by data compromises, including data breaches, leakage, and exposure. California was the top of the US states according to the CMS OCR breach list for 2022, experiencing 1,338 breaches. As technology begins to advance and become more prominent, users are increasingly more vulnerable to cyber threats.

2022 started with Russia’s war of aggression on Ukraine which in addition to human toll, threatened order and put many organizations at risk of spillover cyberattacks. At the same time, China state-nexus adversaries increased their cyber espionage campaigns, and Iranian actors launched destructive “lock and leak” operations using ransomware.74

Cyberattacks are on the increase in the electricity sector. Cyberattacks on utilities have been growing rapidly since 2018, reaching alarmingly high levels in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. More recent attacks in the electricity sector have disabled remote controls for wind farms, disrupted prepaid meters due to unavailable IT systems, and led to recurrent data breaches involving client personally identifiable information. In 2022, the cost of data breach was 4.72 million in the energy sector.75 Figure 30 below shows the average number of weekly cyberattacks by industry for the period 2020-2022.

In May 2021 a ransomware attack on a major petroleum product pipeline’s IT network resulted in major prescriptive measures directing U.S. government agencies to take a series of proactive steps to bolster cybersecurity. The International Energy Authority (IEA) is an international energy forum, its responsibilities include tracking and analyzing global key energy trends, promoting sound energy policy, and fostering multinational energy technology cooperation. It states in one of its articles that there is little public information available on significant cybersecurity incidents due to under-reporting and the lack of detection. That being said, there is evidence that cyberattacks on utilities have been growing rapidly since 2018, reaching alarmingly high levels in 2022 following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. They anticipate that this trend will only continue. 

### 17.2.2 Current Mitigation Efforts
SMUD participates in several cross-collaborative cyber threat prevention initiatives (see Table 50).

#### Table 50: Current Cyber Threat Hazards Mitigation

| Mitigation                          | Description                                                                                                                                                     |

| Identity access management                    | Periodic verification of user accounts, user groups, or user role categories and that privileges assigned are correct. Implementation of user account to least privileged, restricting user accounts to what is needed to do their job. |
| Privileged Access Management Program (PAM) Project | Installation of hardware and software that prevents people from knowing the passwords to generic or shared accounts. Administrator accounts are managed by the system to prevent users from knowing password.  |
| Physical security plan                       | Log entry of individuals with authorized physical access to SMUD campus, monitor unauthorized access through physical access points.                                                                          |
| System security management                    | Evaluate security patches, protect against the use of unnecessary physical input/output ports, generate alerts for security events. SMUD has implemented the Cyber Critical Infrastructure Controls required by NERC Standards and the Cyber Security Controls required by the FERC Division of Dam Safety and Inspection standard. |
| Exercises and testing                        | Conduct periodic exercises and testing to continuously improve the Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan.                                                                                                   |

### 17.3 Physical Threats
Physical security is the protection of personnel, facilities, information, equipment, operations and activities from physical actions and events that could cause serious loss or damage to an enterprise, agency, or institution. This includes protection from fire, flood, natural disasters, burglary, theft, vandalism, and terrorism.78

### 17.3.1 Hazard Profile
**Asset Profile and Security Personnel**  
SMUD has assets spread over a wide geographical area that differ in criticality, type, and vulnerability. The largest set of assets vulnerable to physical attack are our 300+ substations, which vary in size and protection levels applied to mitigate risk or comply with regulatory requirements. SMUD also maintains a turbine farm in the East San Francisco Bay area covering approximately 5000+ acres. There are two large campus-type environments housing the majority of SMUD’s workforce personnel and operational assets. SMUD also has a smaller campus east of the Sacramento area that houses both personnel and equipment that operate and maintain SMUD’s hydropower assets, consisting of several complexes of dams, powerhouses, and switchyards. The approximate total service territory is 900+ square miles.
<!-- Page 161 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

miles and approximate total asset footprint (not counting gas pipeline) of 3000 square miles. This vast area is serviced by a full-time internal security force.

## Current and Past Incidents
SMUD has experienced a wide range of physical security incidents over the past 5 years. SMUD facilities have been subject to unauthorized intrusions, ballistic attack, theft, burglary, vandalism, and other various petty crimes.

### 17.3.2 Vulnerability Assessment
SMUD is a publicly owned electric utility that owns and operates infrastructure that delivers reliable power to the public and is part of the U.S. Bulk Electric System. Like many utilities, SMUD’s infrastructure, if not underground is above ground or overhead and is generally visible to the public. As such, it makes it an easy target for bad actors to exploit.

SMUD maintains processes and documents to protect the physical security of its properties.

**18.0 Other Hazards**

**18.1 Air Pollution**

Air pollution is defined as the air containing any substance that poses harmful or poisonous effects. Air pollution is hazardous to the health of many citizens residing in SMUD’s Plan Area. Sources of air pollution are grouped into four major categories: stationary, mobile, area-wide and natural sources.

**18.1.1 Hazard Profile**

Stationary sources of air pollution include small and large fixed facilities such as power plants, dry cleaners, gasoline stations, and landfills. Mobile sources of pollution include cars, trucks, ships, and airplanes. Area-wide sources of pollution may result from agriculture, consumer products, construction grading or unpaved roads. Natural sources include plant pollens, biological decay, windblown dust, and wildfires. The pollutants from these sources and activities are typically broken up into three major pollutant categories: Criteria (affecting people's respiratory health and/or leading to the creation of ground level Ozone and particulate matter), hazardous (known or suspected to cause cancer and/or other serious health effects), and greenhouse gas (contributing to global warming and climate change).

The American Lung Association’s 24th annual air report, *The State of Air*, utilized the most recent criteria air pollution data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and ranked California the most polluted state to live in. The report also ranked the Sacramento-

As part of its general monitoring process, SMUD leverages a number of different publicly available resources to monitor and forecast air quality within its service territory as well as areas where SMUD employees work. Figures 31 and 32 below are sample maps and data showing in real time, the air quality in the Sacramento area. This data helps air quality agencies forecast and report the “Air Quality Index” (AQI) to the public based on the prevalent pollutants of an applicable weather season. AirNow defines the AQI “as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.” In the summer, the AQI provides ambient levels of ozone and/or particulate, while in the fall and winter seasons, these monitors identify days with high particulate levels. As described.

|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2030 Zero Carbon Plan               | SMUD will continue to evaluate its strategy to reduce its own greenhouse emissions while maintaining electrical reliability for its customers. These strategies include the potential reduction of its fossil fuel use among its power plant fleet, retooling its existing equipment to operate on non-fossil fuels, and/or helping the region electrify both its vehicle and buildings. |
| Air Quality Standards               | SMUD will continue to comply with all local, state, and federal air quality rules and regulations as it applies to its affected equipment and operations. SMUD will also continue to partner with local agencies and industry to influence policies and regulations that improve air quality and reduce potential harmful exposure to poor air quality, and wildfire smoke. |
| Emergency Operations Center (EOC)  | The SMUD Emergency Preparedness Duty Officer will monitor daily National Weather Service forecasts for major air quality impacts and will consider proposing activation of the EOC when AQI is equal to or greater than 500 for two consecutive days across a significant area of the service territory. An AQI at or above 500 is considered an immediate hazard to human health. |
| Worker safety standards             | This standard applies to all SMUD employees, performing various job activities, as identified where the Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM2.5 is greater than 150 to provide guidance on protection for employees during wildfire events. An AQI above 150 to 200 is considered unhealthy for some of the general public, with people in sensitive groups experiencing serious health effects. |
| Building ventilation critical operations | Facilities shall ensure building HVAC filters are inspected and replaced, as needed, during a wildfire event. Facilities will have resources or contracts available to obtain mobile air scrubbers if needed for use at critical infrastructure buildings like the PSO, DSO, Contact Center, Energy Trading, Security Operations. |

18.2 Avalanches  
An avalanche is a weather-related threat that occurs when a mass of snow mixed with ice and debris travels down a mountainside. Avalanches occur in steep mountainous areas of California that receive significant amounts of snow. Avalanches can occur from one or a combination of these components: overloading, temperature, slope angle, snowpack conditions, and vibrations. The most at risk are mountainous areas that have a slope of 25° to 60°.

Avalanches have caused property damage and loss of life in California. Significant events have damaged or destroyed ski resorts at Mt. Shasta and Lake Tahoe. Avalanches have also blocked and damaged roadways. The Plan Area lay amongst the highest regions of avalanche risk in the State of California. Avalanches can pose a major threat to the communities and SMUD’s or WAPA transmission lines, powerhouses, reservoirs, roads, and other infrastructure in the UARP. Secondary impacts may impact SMUD’s customers residing outside of the regions susceptible to avalanches.

Because SMUD has not experienced avalanches, there is not sufficient data to describe the extent of damages.

18.3 Drought and Water Shortage  
Drought is a gradual phenomenon, occurring slowly over a period of time, caused by a rainfall deficit, and often combined with other predisposing factors. It is difficult to quantify the beginning and ending of a drought. There are four different categories in which a drought can be categorized based on its effects (see table 54).

SMUD’s Plan Area has a Mediterranean climate. The summers are dry and warm, and the winters are wet and cool. Its proximity to the Pacific Ocean and major mountain ranges defines most of the State’s precipitation and runoff. A majority of the water vapor that provides the State’s precipitation comes from the ocean. The snowpack in the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada contributes to the runoff in the rivers and groundwater.

basins. Approximately 75% of the state's annual precipitation occurs between November and March. Many California’s droughts stem from an absence, or reduction, of winter precipitation.

**Exposure and Vulnerability**  
California experienced one of the worst droughts in history from 2012 to 2017: 102 million trees died during that time period. This has increased SMUD’s vulnerability for tree mortality. In 2014, 100% of the State was experiencing a drought ranked “severe” or worse. During the period of 2012 to 2015, Lake Tahoe warmed 15 times faster than it had historically. The drought became so severe that Governor Jerry Brown instituted a mandatory 25% water restriction in 2015. The drought exacerbated wildfires during those years.

California’s most significant historical statewide droughts were 1929-34, 1976-77, 1987-92, 2007-09, 2012-17 and 2020-2022 (see table 55).

**Table 55: Historical Droughts in California**

| Year     | Duration (years) | Description                                                                                     |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1929-34  | 6                | Occurred when the state’s urban and agricultural developments were minimal, therefore the impacts to the economy and community were substantial. |
| 1976-77  | 2                | Brief but severe due to the low amounts of precipitation and runoff.                           |
| 1987-92  | 6                | Impacted the entire state of California by almost completely depleting the State’s major water reserves and projects. |
| 2007-09  | 3                | First ever-statewide proclamation of emergency for drought was issued. Water shortages resulted in economic burdens to agriculture and to rural communities. |
| 2012-17  | 6                | Issued California’s second ever-statewide proclamation of emergency for drought. Recorded its lowest annual precipitations in four consecutive years (2012-2015). |
| 2020-22  | 3                | Driest three-year period dating back to 1896, resulting in a state of emergency across California. |

In 2015, at the drought’s most severe point, snowpack was estimated to be at 5% of normal levels. The previous lows for snowpack depletion were in 2014 and 1977, each at 25% of normal levels. During a “normal” year, snowpack contributes 30% of California’s water needs. 

Figure 33 below depicts drought intensities from 2000-2023 compiled by the US Drought Monitor. The drought was at its worst for many months beginning in mid-2014 and extending through the end of 2016. In January of 2017, the multi-year drought abruptly ended.

**Drought impacts** are felt first by people most dependent on annual rainfall—such as ranchers using dryland range or rural residents relying on wells in low-yield rock formations. Drought impacts increase with the length of a drought, as carry-over supplies in reservoirs are depleted and water levels in groundwater basins decline. The most common secondary effects of drought that are realized by SMUD and occupants in its Plan Area are the environmental impacts such as wildfire hazard, increased tree mortality, the reduced availability of surface water, and the loss of biodiversity in the animal and plant species in the area.

### Past Events
The Plan Area has experienced prior drought conditions in recent years with drought periods recorded 2020-2022, 2012-2017, 2007-09, 2000-04, 1987-92, 1975-77 and 195961. Table 59 shows the available data found for most recent drought events available in the NCDC database for the Plan Area.

Most detrimental to SMUD’s operations and its ability to serve its customers during a drought, is the reduced ability to generate hydroelectric power. A reduction of hydropower generation and water quality deterioration are potential hazards that could affect SMUD during an extended drought period. Droughts have the capacity to affect the following:
- **Hydropower**: lower water levels impact production capacity in hydroelectric plants
- **Biomass**: changes in seasonal precipitation patterns can impact vegetation growth, altering the availability of feedstock for biomass generators.

**18.3.2 Current Mitigation Efforts**  
Based on the results of SMUD’s Climate Readiness Action Plan assessment, SMUD continues to monitor how drought impacts energy generation and commodity costs. SMUD has several initiatives that reduce the risk of water shortages in drought conditions, including the hydro rate stabilization fund that accrues money to purchase replacement power in years with lost hydropower generation. Additionally, SMUD is in cooperation of the SPA with the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (Regional San) to deliver recycled water from Regional San treatment facilities to be used for cooling and fire protection at the SPA power plant. The table below depicts mitigation efforts for drought hazards.

**18.4 Hazardous Material Release**

Hazardous materials have properties that make them potentially dangerous and harmful both to human health and the environment. The Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) regulates hazardous materials in California. DTSC defines hazardous materials as materials with properties that make it potentially dangerous or harmful to human health or the environment. The universe of hazardous materials is large and diverse. Hazardous materials can be liquids, solids, or contained gases.91

**18.4.1 Hazard Profile**

An accidental hazardous material release can occur wherever hazardous materials are manufactured, stored, transported, or used. There could also be incidents of intentional hazardous release either from terrorist or provocateur activities. Depending on the material involved, the release may affect nearby population and/or contaminate critical or sensitive environmental areas within the Plan Area.

The release of hazardous materials to the environment could damage the environment, property, or human health. The extent of damages is dependent on the type, location, quantity, concentration, physical, chemical and/or infectiousness of the material released. Although hazardous material incidents can happen almost anywhere, certain areas of the state are at higher risk. These include areas: near roadways (frequently used for transporting hazardous materials), adjacent to industrial facilities (that use, store, or dispose hazardous materials), and crossed by certain railways, waterways, airways, and pipelines (that transport hazardous materials).

Releases of explosive and highly flammable materials have been known to cause fatalities and injuries, necessitate large-scale evacuations, and destroy millions of dollars' worth of property.

property. Toxic chemicals in gaseous form have been known to cause injuries and fatalities among emergency response teams and passersby. Serious health effects have been known to result when toxic materials enter surface or ground water supplies. Releases of hazardous chemicals have been especially damaging when they have occurred in highly populated areas or along heavily traveled transportation routes.

### 18.4.2 Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD’s Plan Area is a mix of urban, suburban, and rural areas. Military and former military installations located in SMUD’s Plan Area must be considered as potential sources for hazardous material releases. When a hazardous material emergency occurs, multiple resources are available with the local fire departments typically leading response activities. SMUD’s Plan Area contains major transportation arteries, such as interstates, highways, railroads, and airports, each facilitating the transport of hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials through and into SMUD’s Plan Area each year. SMUD is highly exposed to the effects of a major catastrophic hazardous material emergency due to the proximity of the transportation routes to densely populated areas. Additionally, SMUD must be concerned with the Port of West Sacramento and the various bulk gasoline terminals located along the Yolo County side of the Sacramento River front because prevailing winds come from the southwest. Considerations must be made also for the numerous agriculturally related businesses located within the response/mutual aid area.

SMUD’s Plan Area contains major oil and gasoline terminals, drinking and wastewater pumping facilities, and numerous large diameter underground pipelines. Agriculture uses large quantities of pesticides and chemicals that are stored at numerous sites. Fixed facilities are limited to small industrial parks within or near the incorporated cities. Air transportation of hazardous materials involves the smallest quantities but still poses a potential hazard.

There are also numerous underground and aboveground storage tank facilities for flammable liquids throughout SMUD’s Plan Area.

### 18.4.3 Current Mitigation Efforts
SMUD owns and/or operates several potential sources of hazardous materials releases. SMUD follows all federal, state, and local regulations relating to the use, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials. All hazardous material Safety Data Sheets specific to an asset or location are kept on site and also available online. Field and support staffs are trained to respond to leaks, spills, and discharges. All SMUD facilities above regulatory mandated quantity thresholds operate under Hazardous Materials Business Plans (HMBPs) prepared by the Environmental Services Department. These plans are updated annually and certified as accurate with the applicable local governing agency.

### 18.5 Oil Spill
#### 18.5.1 Hazard Profile
An oil spill is a release of liquid petroleum into the environment due to human activity or technological error that results in the pollution of land, water, or air. Oil spills can also

![Page 152](https://example.com/image-url)

**18.5.2 Exposure and Vulnerability**  
Some of SMUD’s electric and mechanical equipment utilize oils to operate. This equipment and affected facilities are located on land near stormwater systems and waterways. However, SMUD is at very low risk for the likelihood of an oil spill event because of existing mitigations (see table 61: Current Hazardous Materials and Oil Spill Hazards Mitigation).

SMUD’s Plan Area is land-locked and is not susceptible to underwater seeps or disasters related to offshore oil drilling. The most likely oil spill hazards threatening SMUD’s Plan Area is the release of oil from either third-party vehicle accidents (involving SMUD’s oil-containing equipment) or the malfunction/failure of the oil-containing equipment.

Today, our five natural gas plants provide low-cost, reliable power 24/7. Eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from our power plants is essential to reach our zero-carbon goal by 2030. We’re focused on reimagining our existing generation portfolio to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions through replacement, re-tooling and using renewable fuels. To drastically reduce SMUD's fossil fuel related greenhouse gas emissions, we currently plan to adjust the utilization of the generation fleet by placing at least 2 power plants while exploring retrofit technologies such as alternative fuels and/or post-combustion controls. Maintaining reliable electric service is critical, so we will conduct more detailed reliability assessments before finalizing plans for our natural gas power plants.

We will expand the use of our existing carbon-free energy technologies like wind, solar, hydro, biomass, geothermal energy, battery storage and demand response. While these proven carbon-free technologies aren’t fully capable of achieving our 2030 zero carbon goal, they can help get us about 90% of the way there. Today, SMUD’s power supply is about 50% carbon-free. Our plan includes adding ~3,000 Megawatts of new renewable energy and storage, which is equivalent to the energy needs of more than 600,000 homes per year. This includes growing rooftop and battery storage adoption.

We will explore new and emerging technologies—like power-to-gas technology, hydrogen and methane, long-duration batteries, and carbon sequestration—that are either currently unknown or are not ready for large scale adoption due to price, reliability or other factors. This work will help us identify potential partnerships and business models like virtual power plants, and launch pilot projects and programs to test and prove new and emerging technologies and develop paths for prioritizing technology adoption and scaling.

Our road map to zero carbon identifies cost ranges and rate impacts associated with expanding our existing proven clean technologies and for researching and piloting new technologies and business models. We’re focused on making sure achieving our zero-

18.5.3 Current Mitigation Efforts  
The table below depicts the mitigation activities for hazardous materials and oil spills.

**Table 58: Current Hazardous Materials and Oil Spill Hazards Mitigation**

| Mitigation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Spill Prevention Control and Counter Measure (SPCC) Program | The SPCC program provides mitigation control to prevent discharges of oil, and properly respond to discharges of oil, if it does occur. Facilities with equipment over mandated storage volumes (either individually or cumulatively) are part of a SPCC plan. The plan outlines equipment requirements and engineering controls, inspection criteria and frequencies, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements.<br><br>For example, Appendix B of SMUD’s Substation Specific SPCC Plan contains the “Substation Maintenance Oil Spill Cleanup for SMUD Substation Facilities” and the “Environmental Services Oil Spill Response for SMUD Substation Facilities” procedures. These oil spill cleanup and contingency procedures contain guidelines for performing the necessary oil spill cleanup, notifications, and reporting. The Substation Maintenance procedure identifies the actions that shall be taken by Substation Maintenance personnel upon discovering and responding to an oil spill. The Environmental Services procedure identifies the actions that shall be performed by HazMat Services and Environmental Services personnel when responding to an oil spill at a SMUD substation facility. These procedures were written to ensure that any oil spill at a substation facility is cleaned up as expeditiously as possible in an environmentally responsible manner.<br><br>In addition to the information included in the above procedures, the SPCC plans also outline that SMUD maintains: 1) HazMat Services, Substation Maintenance, and Environmental Services personnel on-call at all times to ensure that an oil spill is cleaned up as soon as reasonably possible; 2) an Emergency Contact List which lists local, state, and federal regulatory agencies as well as key SMUD personnel; 3) guidelines for performing the necessary oil spill notifications and reporting requirements. |

| Hazardous Material Business Plan (HMBP) | The HMBP program is overseen by the local Certified Unified Program Agency (CUPA) (e.g., a local agency certified by the California Environmental Protection Agency to implement and enforce State hazardous waste and hazardous materials regulatory management programs). The HMBP provides an inventory of materials and outlines mitigation controls to prevent or minimize harm to public health, safety, the environment, from a release of a hazardous material. A HMBP is required when hazardous materials are present above certain threshold quantities at a site. <br><br> The plan contains detailed information about the hazardous materials stored onsite, including but not limited to 1) inventory volumes and/or weights; 2) detailed site map(s) and applicable material storage and handling location(s); 3) important SDS details and signage; 4) site specific emergency response plans; and 5) personnel training requirements and frequencies; and 6) recordkeeping and reporting requirements. As such, the plan is also shared via an online database with local agencies and first responders. This helps ensure that outside agencies understand the hazardous present at an applicable site. |
| HMBP Emergency Response Plan             | The Emergency Response Plan is a subset of the HMBP. It is site specific and details the procedures in the event of a release (or threatened release of a hazardous material), including, but not limited to: 1) immediate notification contacts to the appropriate local emergency response personnel and to the CUPA; 2) mitigation of a release (or threatened release) for each hazardous material to minimize any potential harm or damage to persons, property, or the environment; and 3) evacuation plans and procedures.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Training                                 | SMUD’s personnel is trained to handle and report hazardous material and oil spills in the same general manner for facilities storing hazardous materials in quantities below SPCC and/or HMBP applicability thresholds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Engineering Controls and Best Management Practices | SMUD uses a mixture of engineering controls and best management practices (BMPs) to design and operate the facilities and their respective equipment in a manner that reduces the likelihood of a spill or release. Engineering controls include emergency sumps large enough to capture spilled oil within a facility, visual and/or audible alarms to manage storage tank volumes and prevent storage tank overfill, and “oil minder pumps” that prevent the pumping of oil impacted water out of catch basins. BMPs include establishing equipment inspection frequencies, using standard inspection forms, installation of additional signage, and training specific to a site or asset.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## 18.6 Natural Gas Pipeline Hazards

### 18.6.1 Hazard Profile
SMUD owns and operates 76 linear miles of natural gas pipelines. Natural gas from these pipelines is required to operate SMUD’s thermal power plants and to help SMUD meet its load serving capability. SMUD’s pipelines are in and near communities where people work and live. In operating the pipelines, safety is SMUD’s top priority. SMUD is committed in protecting the people, environment, and communities along these pipelines.

### 18.6.2 Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD’s gas pipelines are fewer and newer as compared with other utilities. However, in the event of a gas pipeline breach, impacts could result in total loss of assets and damage to surrounds up to and including loss of life. Increasing population growth in urban areas is resulting in a greater number of people living and working closer to existing gas transmission pipelines. The aging of SMUD’s gas transmission system also slightly increases the risk of potential disaster. Causes of and contributors to pipeline failures include third party damage, construction defects, material defects, internal and external corrosion, operational errors, control system malfunctions, outside force damage, subsidence, and seismicity.

### 18.6.3 Current Mitigation Efforts
The Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is the primary safety regulator of the pipeline system. Its regulations and safety standards address a variety of issues affecting pipeline safety, including pipe and component manufacture, how pipelines are built, operated, maintained, and inspected, how personnel are trained, and how companies respond to emergencies.

SMUD meets and exceeds all regulatory requirements through SMUD Gas Pipeline Operations integrity management program which includes, detective controls through line patrols and leak detection systems, process controls, participation in the USA North 811 system (call before you dig) and engineering controls such as remote operating valves with LineBreak systems to respond to gas leaks. These controls are implemented to ensure public safety and prevent compromise to SMUD’s gas transmission systems.

SMUD is a member of USA North, which provides a free damage prevention service to protect citizens, the community, the environment, essential public services, and underground facilities in Central and Northern California and all of Nevada. USA North.

### 18.7 Nuclear Hazards
Nuclear hazard is referred to as the risk or danger to any living species or environment posed by radiation emanating from the atomic nuclei of a given substance.

#### 18.7.1 Hazard Profile
There are no natural nuclear hazards in the Plan Area. There is a very low probability of accidental exposure of solid material managed by local businesses, including SMUD. Close up, unprotected exposure to radioactive materials can have negative long-term health effects.

#### 18.7.2 Exposure and Vulnerability
SMUD owns the decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Spent fuel is stored onsite in the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) awaiting the DOE direction to move it to an appropriate facility. Rancho Seco is in Sacramento County, 25 miles southeast of the City of Sacramento and 26 miles northeast of the City of Stockton, the two largest cities within a 50-mile radius of the site. The site occupies approximately 14 of the 2480 SMUD-owned acres at the Rancho Seco site, which is flat to rolling terrain. The nearest population center of 25,000 or more is the City of Galt, which is about 10 miles northwest of the site. State Route 104 runs north of the site in an east-west direction. Route 104 connects with U.S. Route 99 and Interstate 5 to the west and State Routes 88 and 12 to the east.

The area near Rancho Seco is sparsely populated and is used primarily as grazing land and grape vineyards. The only public use facility within a 5-mile radius of the site is the Rancho Seco Reservoir and Recreation Area, which is located approximately 1 mile southeast of the site and is within the land owned by SMUD. There is no indication of geological faulting at the site.

The risk that radiation exposure because of long-term storage of nuclear spent fuel at Rancho Seco may result in environmental, health and safety risks is extremely low. Incidents that lead to a breach of spent fuel canister integrity are unlikely to occur.

The ISFSI Safety Analysis Report (SAR) discusses the design criteria and accident analysis criteria for the spent fuel storage system. It identifies potential incidents such as fires associated with combustible materials, loss of contamination control, natural phenomena, and external human caused events such as terrorism. The ISFSI SAR provides an analysis of

18.7.3 Current Mitigation Efforts  
The table below depicts mitigation actions for radiological hazards.

**Table 60: Current Radiological Hazards Mitigation**

| Mitigation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Rancho Seco site-specific Emergency Plan approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission | In the event of an emergency occurring at Rancho Seco, the site-specific Emergency Plan will be implemented. Response includes activating emergency response facilities; making formal notifications to SMUD’s management, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and Sacramento County Office of Emergency Operations; response and recovery activities. |
| Exercises | Every 2 years, SMUD leads an exercise with outside agencies to verify adequacy of the emergency plan and develop action plans to correct any identified variances as appropriate. Annually conduct on-site drills required by the emergency plan to evaluate training and implementation as well as identify potential deficiencies to correct via action plan. |
| Physical barriers and monitoring | Fence surrounds emergency planning zone with controlled access and various monitoring devices. |
| Law and regulations | SMUD continues to follow and apply rules and regulations under 10 C.F.R. §72.32 and any future updates as required. |
| State and Sacramento County Offices of Emergency Services | Periodic meetings to update agencies on emergency plan changes, share emergency response telephone directory (ERTD), and conduct semi-annual communication testing. |
| Radiation monitoring | Continuous monitoring of radiation badges quarterly. |
| Site specific physical security plan approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission | Site specific plan outlining specific physical security requirements and actions. |
| Monitoring Federal actions | SMUD is monitoring Federal actions for moving spent nuclear fuel. |

18.8 Bird Strike  
Bird strikes are defined as avian/power line interactions including electrocutions, collisions and nesting, avian/wind turbine collisions and avian/aircraft interactions.

18.8.1 Exposure and Vulnerability  
SMUD owns and operates several wind turbine facilities located in Solano County. Collisions between wildlife and turbines often occur, causing detriment to the wildlife as well as damages to SMUD facilities. In addition to damages, collisions between wildlife and turbines can pose risks to both wildlife and operational integrity.

<!-- Page 181 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**18.8.2 Current Mitigation Efforts**  
Basic mitigation strategies for bird strike are broken into three strategies: Increase resistance to bird strike, remove birds from an area, or move the infrastructure away from the birds (see Table 61).

**Table 61: Current Bird Strike Hazards Mitigation**

| Mitigation          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Design              | SMUD has an Avian Protection Plan which requires SMUD to implement mortality reduce measures in response to bird-caused outages and the use of avian safe standards where it’s required to maximize phase separation and phase-to-ground clearance to minimize the risk of electrocution or to prevent perching where sufficient clearances cannot be achieved. |
| Wildlife management  | Taking lethal and non-lethal measures to remove wildlife habitats and potential food sources from crucial infrastructure such as wind turbines.                                                                 |
| Operations          | SMUD has a bird and bat protection plan and an eagle take permit for the Solano Wind project which requires mitigation measures to be implemented when bird mortalities including eagle occur including curtailment of wind turbines to minimize bird mortality. |
| Relocation          | If infrastructure is prone to bird strike, an investment might be made to relocate assets to reduce the likelihood of a hazardous event.                                                                     |

**18.9 Pandemic**  
**18.9.1 Hazard Profile**  
The World Health Organization defines a pandemic as an epidemic occurring over a wide area, usually affecting a large number of people. Pandemics typically occur when a new virus appears, toward which the human population has not built immunity. Historically, SMUD’s Plan Area has seen the influenza pandemics of 1918, 1957, and 1968, the Swine Flu pandemic, and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic.  

**18.9.2 Assessment of Vulnerability**  
Pandemics are unpredictable and have the potential to adversely impact SMUD’s operations. SMUD’s aptness to predict and meet load demand is challenged heavily during a pandemic. Load demands may be hampered by consumers reacting to social distance.

### 18.10 Supply Chain Hazards
#### 18.10.1 Hazard Profile
Many disruptors are driving supply chain gridlock and impacting end-to-end operations. Pre-pandemic supply chain vulnerability as a result of geographic concentration continue to be compounded by the effects of the pandemic and increased geopolitical tensions. As such, supply chain disruptions have affected operations across most industries, including.

the electric power sector. Unavailable materials, project delays, inflation, eroded capital budgets, prolonged labor shortages and strained operations are a few of the potential drivers of supply chain risk.

## 18.10.2 Assessment of Vulnerability
A number of factors make it challenging for SMUD’s supply chains to operate efficiently and at full value. Material shortage and scarcity of crucial items, such as electric steel, electronic components, and cable, are disrupting supply. SMUD has been impacted by the lack of available transformers, many of which are manufactured overseas. Delivery times in many cases more than doubled, taking years to procure certain critical equipment such as transformers. These challenges continue to be exacerbated by the rise of geopolitical tensions. A recent Kearny article sited that “suppliers recognize the gap between demand and their supply of transformers, but even if they can increase production or bring it onshore, new facilities take time to build. Many shortages show no sign of letting up, with manufacturers struggling to fill orders during emergencies or canceling them altogether”94. Figure 35 is a chart resulting from Kearny’s client interviews.

In addition, supply chain shortages increase demand and prices continue to rise. Figure 35 shows the change in price for transformer cost showing largely unchanged prices through 2020 and a rise in 134 percent since then. The Kearny study noted a similar trend for electric wires and cable costs.

**Lead times: transformers**  
OEMs are having to cancel orders they can’t fulfill.  
**Lead times: electric cables**  
Suppliers are also finding it increasingly difficult to fulfill emergency stockpiles.

| Transformers          | 3         | 12   | 18+      |
| Electric cables       | 1         | 3    | 3x       |

![Figure 36: Equipment Lead Time Changes](https://www.kearney.com/industry/energy/article/-/insights/supply-chain-resilience-can-propel-the-power-sector-through-the-energy-transition)  
**Power transformer PPI (January 2019 through March 2023)**  
134% increase in prices since Jan 2021  
Transformer prices were largely unchanged in first year of pandemic... but rose sharply in 2021 and have continued to remain elevated.  

**Cost drivers and trends:**  
- **Raw materials** (for example, copper, steel, aluminum): highly sensitive to commodity cost increases (comprise ~60% of total transformer cost)  
- **Labor:** post-pandemic rate increases applied to a shrinking labor pool hinders production  
- **Technology and overhead costs**

Supply chain disruptions result in increased operational costs, project delays, the loss of productivity, increased lead times and customer impact.

For SMUD, this means potential delays in achievement of our goals, specifically the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. Meeting a 100 percent clean electricity goal by 2030 requires increasing SMUD’s clean energy resource capacities. This means building new renewable energy projects, requiring more materials, many of which are imported. With high reliance on certain materials and competing demand from various industries, SMUD and other utilities are faced with potential delays or increased costs to achieve decarbonization. In addition, increasing customer capacity due to new construction and electrification in some instances requires new facilities be built to meet these demands.

# 19.0 Goals and Objectives

## 19.1 Authorities, Policies, Programs and Resources

SMUD’s mitigation strategy is made up of three components required by Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.). These components are goals, actions, and action plan.

SMUD is owned by its customers, who elect a seven-member Board of Directors. Each director represents a different geographic region within SMUD’s service territory. The job of the SMUD Board is to establish policies and values about how SMUD serves its customers and to set the long-term direction in the form of strategic directives. All important decisions made by SMUD staff must support one or more of the strategic directives.

The development of SMUD’s planning process, risk assessment, goal setting and identification of mitigation actions by SMUD’s PC led to the mitigation strategy and mitigation action plans for the HMP. As part of the development process, a comprehensive review of the mitigation efforts and strategies were conducted by SMUD’s PC, internal and external stakeholders, and subject matter experts (SMEs). The result was the HMP for SMUD with reorganized risk assessments and priorities. The mitigation actions from the 2018 HMP were refined and reaffirmed, and goals were added and deleted, as appropriate.

Throughout the process of planning for the HMP, the PC reviewed the results of the hazard identification, vulnerability assessment, and capability assessment. The analysis of the risk assessment allowed the PC to recognize areas in which improvements could be made and provided a framework for the PC to create goals and objectives to develop new mitigation strategies for SMUD’s Plan Area.

Daily operations and decision-making are delegated by SMUD’s Board of Directors to the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer, who along with other members of the Executive Team establish guidelines for SMUD activities. The most prominent guideline set by the Executive Team is SMUD’s 2023-2026 Strategy. The top priority area is to Be Safe Always, which has a direct relationship to hazard mitigation. This commitment at the Executive level to safety is critical for SMUD whose primary activity is the generation and delivery of electricity. Not only is the generation and transmission of electricity an inherently hazardous activity but using stored water in mountainous terrain under pressure as the means of electrical generation expands the hazard.

SMUD management, departments, and employees recognize, value, and support projects that ensure a well-planned, coordinated, efficient, and rapid response in the event of an emergency to protect the lives, environment, and property of the citizens in communities where our assets and operations reside.

## 19.2 Risk Prioritization

SMUD’s HMP leverages its existing ERM framework to identify and determine the hazards that SMUD is most vulnerable to. The ERM framework takes into consideration impacts to

![SMUD Hazard Mitigation Plan](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**19.3 Existing Mitigation Strategies**

To identify and select mitigation actions that need to have additional practices implemented, or changed, the PC began by prioritizing hazards that were of high risk to SMUD’s Plan Area. Hazards of high risk were those in which current mitigation actions needed to be re-analyzed, and it needed to be decided if additional mitigation actions could be implemented using SMUD’s current technological capabilities. Low-priority hazard risks are often mitigated using mitigation actions of less specificity than those of high-priority hazards.

Once priority was determined, the PC analyzed additional actions that supported the identified goals and objectives of the HMP. The PC utilized examples of potential mitigation actions from a variety of other agencies. Preventative mitigation alternatives were discussed for each hazard, and additions were made to the existing strategies as deemed necessary.

Mitigation actions are listed with the associated hazards.

**19.4 Mitigation Action Plans**

Planning and prioritization of projects at SMUD is performed through a variety of mechanisms. High level guidance is provided in SMUD’s 5-Year Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan), which represents a balance between the strategies, projects, programs, and other initiatives aimed at ensuring SMUD’s success in an evolving energy industry. Goals and initiatives referenced in the Strategic Plan translate into more specific, action-oriented policies or projects and thus serve as a framework for achieving the intent of the Strategic Plan.

From this and other forms of guidance, individual asset managers, such as the UARP Asset Manager, must prepare a 3-Year Budget Plan that identifies operations and maintenance (O&M) and capital projects that are anticipated over the course of the next three years. The 3-Year Budget Plan is reviewed by the respective business area Directors and is recommended to the Executives, then the Board for final approval.

The priority associated with each project during each budget cycle is dependent on several factors that affect the relative importance of a project in any given year. Projects are either mandatory or discretionary and their inclusion in any given year’s plan is based on regulatory requirements or their relationship to SMUD’s guiding principles.

SMUD also evaluates projects across the organization to ensure Operational Excellence. This essentially translates into our Project Portfolio Management, which seeks to coordinate and align SMUD-wide resource allocation and operations over a 2-3-year planning horizon. A group of leaders from across SMUD, called the Operational Alignment.

**166 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028**
<!-- Page 189 -->
![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](https://example.com/image)

**Team (OAT)**, meets regularly to select the overall portfolio of projects, both mandatory and discretionary, track progress throughout the year, and approve significant changes.

Each of these activities (OAT meetings, departmental planning, and project reviews) employ the same prioritization process that results in the general project classifications of high, medium, and low priority projects. The criterion for the three priority categories includes the following:

### High Priority Project Criteria
- Needed to promote safety and protect the lives of SMUD workers and the public,
- Needed to protect SMUD infrastructure and public property,
- Risks are tied to recent disasters and expected to worsen under climate change,
- Strong public support,
- Viewed favorably or required by regulatory agencies,
- Strongly tied to the maintenance of electric stability and reliability,
- Clear and concrete long-term and lasting benefits,
- Highly favorable benefit/cost ratio, and/or
- Supported by pilot projects and/or other successful applications.

### Medium Priority Project Criteria
- Enhancements to safety and protection of lives, but not absolutely needed,
- Enhancements to the protection of SMUD infrastructure and public property,
- Risks are not strongly tied to recent disasters and climate change,
- Moderate public support,
- Viewed as neutral by regulatory agencies,
- Uncertain and theoretical duration of benefits,
- Neutral benefit/cost ratio, and/or
- No pilot projects or other successful applications.

### Low Priority Project Criteria
- Limited relationship to safety and the protection of SMUD workers and the public,
- Limited value in the protection of SMUD infrastructure and public property,
- Minimal to no public support,
- Risk(s) is/are not associated with historical disasters and not affected by climate change,
- No regulatory requirement, and/or
- Cost does not justify the benefits achieved from project deployment.

### 19.5 Plan Integration
An important project implementation mechanism is to incorporate the recommendation into existing business processes. The hazards outlined in this HMP will be one factor in risk assessments and review of projects and initiatives for SMUD and will be integrated into the project planning, budget, and risk assessment process.

![20.0 Mitigation Best Practices and Adaptive Capacity](https://example.com/image.png)

20.0 Mitigation Best Practices and Adaptive Capacity  
SMUD carries the primary responsibility for implementing and updating hazard mitigation strategies. The HMP is a living document that will be revised and improved over time to increase its effectiveness in implementing and properly tracking mitigation strategies. Staff will leverage SMUD’s existing planning process in the implementation of this HMP.

20.1 Progress of Mitigation Efforts  
SMUD’s ERM Office (ERMO) (along with various associated business units) will monitor the implementation of each hazard mitigation, and the progress made towards the goals of the evolving, HMP. The PC will review and update the status of the implementation of mitigation actions on an annual basis. To standardize the monitoring of the HMP goals, status updates of its specific goals will be integrated into the existing ERM program activities.

SMUD’s ERM program will consider the following to evaluate the effectiveness of the HMP:  
- Has the risk environment changed?  
- Are there other new and emerging risks that have the potential to impact the Plan Area?  
- Do the identified goals and actions address the current and expected conditions?  
- Have the mitigation actions been implemented or completed?  
- Has the implementation of identified mitigation actions resulted in expected outcomes?  
- Are current resources adequate to implement the mitigation plans?  
- Should additional resources be committed to address the identified risks?  
- What needs to be changed in order to achieve the expected outcome?  

The ERMO is responsible for coordinating periodic discussions with stakeholders to perform a review of mitigations and consider whether mitigations need to be reestablished and/or are still relevant to the corresponding potential hazards.

It is important to note that addressing potential hazards requires viewing hazard mitigation strategies as long-term practices. However, these hazard mitigation strategies have a necessity to constantly evolve and become enhanced due to the growing threat of climate change and the speed of technological advances. Climate change is expected to increase the rate of and exacerbate hazards. This may require the adoption of new technology and the innovation of new mitigation techniques.

SMUD will need to constantly integrate the growing impacts of climate change into the HMP’s hazard mitigation strategies. It is possible that efforts to reduce risk in the short-term may increase risk in the long-term.

20.2 Change in Priorities  
SMUD’s Executive Team reviews changes and proposed additions to the Enterprise Portfolio on a monthly basis to account for changes in commodity markets, work  

168 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028

![Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028](attachment://image.png)

progression, and adjustments to our priorities. The monthly Enterprise Portfolio Review meeting kicks off with our “Strategic Pulse Check” to ensure staff are focused on key projects and updates are made to the 6 Month Look Ahead. Both financial and performance snapshots are then reviewed for year-to-date progress towards our financial and operational goals. Project starts, stops, and changes impacting the portfolio are discussed for decision by the Executive team. New work presented to this team goes through the same process and scoring methodology as our annual planning process to review business case and resource availability. This information and approvals of new work enables SMUD to continually review and optimize our Enterprise Portfolio.

### 21.1.2 Status of Plan Incorporation Actions

SMUD’s Enterprise Prioritization process helps to ensure alignment across SMUD, focused on delivering the things that are most important to the organization, customers, and community. This includes the evaluation, assessment, and prioritization of work to meet SMUD’s key strategic and operational business goals, strategic portfolio management, and facilitation of Executive investment decisions.

<!-- Page 193 -->
# 21.2 Plan Prioritization

## 21.2.1 Benefit/Cost Review
Initiatives within the action plan must be prioritized according to a benefit/cost analysis (44 C.F.R. § 201.6(c)(3)(iii)). Projects and initiatives that address hazard mitigation will follow SMUD’s current Enterprise Prioritization Process.

SMUD’s Enterprise Prioritization scoring methodology consists of 4 components – Strategic Alignment, Risk, Business Unit Criticality, and Financials. Our Strategic Alignment component encompasses the benefit to the organization and strategy of completing the work. SMUD leverages a weighted scoring methodology, with the individual weighting of each component to be determined annually based on the current environment SMUD is facing for the upcoming year. Typically, the strategic alignment and risk components are more heavily weighted than the other components.

The financial score will only consider costs and financial savings or revenue that will be reflected in SMUD’s budget. Cost savings to customers or risk-based cost calculations are not included. The score requires a calculation of net present value, which is today’s value of expected cash flows minus today’s value of invested cash. Present value of lifetime cost minus present value of lifetime benefit.

## 21.2.2 Grant Pursuit Priority
The priority for pursuing funding for each action was assigned based on the following criteria:
- **High priority** – An action that
  - meets identified grant eligibility requirements,
  - has high benefits,
  - is prioritized via Enterprise Prioritization, and
  - local funding options are unavailable, limited, or available local funds could be used instead for actions that are not eligible for grant funding.
  
- **Medium priority** – An action that
  - meets identified grant eligibility requirements,
  - has medium or low benefits,
  - is prioritized via Enterprise Prioritization, and
  - local funding options are unavailable, limited, or available local funds could be used instead for actions that are not eligible for grant funding.
  
- **Low priority** – An action that
  - has not been identified as meeting any grant eligibility requirements.

<!-- Page 201 -->
# 22.0 Plan Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance

## 22.1 Plan Adoption
SMUD operates under the oversight and guidance of its Board of Directors. SMUD’s 2018 HMP was adopted by SMUD’s Board of Directors on June 24, 2019. As part of the process of updating and implementing the 2024-2028 HMP Update, a preliminary version of this plan was presented to the Board of Directors on (Date) at the (Name of Committee Meeting). Following input from the Board, the HMP was then submitted to Cal OES and ultimately to FEMA for review and acceptance.

Within approximately eight weeks of FEMA’s pre-approval of the HMP, the final plan will be presented to SMUD’s Board of Directors during a regularly scheduled meeting for formal adoption.

## 22.2 Plan Implementation
The effectiveness of the HMP depends on the implementation and incorporation of its action items into existing planning processes. This HMP will serve to support SMUD’s decision-making process in the next 5-years. The mitigation activities will be prioritized according to SMUD’s budget and planning process.

## 22.3 Plan Maintenance
### 22.3.1 Integration with Other Planning Processes
The mitigation activities within the HMP will follow SMUD’s Enterprise Prioritization process as outlined in section 21.3.1. Benefits/Cost Review.

### 22.3.2 Plan Evaluation and Monitoring
Evaluation of progress will be recognized by monitoring changes in the hazard risk-potentials that have been identified previously in the HMP. Changes in risk-potential can be denoted as:
- Increased hazard risk-potential because of a new development. 
- Increased hazard risk-potential because of a changed mitigation strategy.
- Decreased hazard risk-potential because of the success of a mitigation strategy.

Updates to the HMP will include the above changes in risk-potential as well as:
- Recognizing new hazards that arise in SMUD’s Plan Area.
- Utilizing new data or studies on current and/or future hazards.
- Incorporating new capabilities in mitigating specific hazards.
- Incorporating newly acquired assets and all growth and development of current infrastructure.

---

97 Be it naturally occurring, or human caused.  
179 | Hazard Mitigation Plan 2024 - 2028
<!-- Page 202 -->
Updates to the HMP will also be made to accommodate actions that have failed or are not considered feasible after a review of their consistency with the established progress markers.

### 22.3.3 Plan Update Method and Schedule
SMUD will update the HMP, formally, every five years. The update process will begin in the 3–4-year period to give sufficient time for stakeholder engagement and evaluation of actions. Additionally, SMUD will be tracking the mitigation efforts through its existing business processes. Mitigations will be reviewed during the annual prioritization process and periodic enterprise risk reviews. Progress of any hazard mitigation projects will be tracked through the existing project management reporting process. Updates during these processes will be integrated into the plan as appropriate. The updates will be reviewed by the PC periodically and finalized during the 3–4-year review period. Maintenance of the HMP will be conducted in accordance with DMA 2000.

The ERMO is responsible for initiating plan maintenance, and tracking status updates of installed mitigation efforts and changing threats in SMUD’s Plan Area. Following a hazard event triggering SMUD’s Emergency Operation Center (EOC), the ERMO will revisit the plan to ensure mitigation strategies are being implemented as stated and to discuss possible future changes to the HMP. The next formal plan update for the SMUD HMP will occur five years from the date that this HMP is approved by Cal OES and FEMA.

### 22.4 Continuing Public Involvement
The draft HMP and final approved HMP will remain available to the public on the HMP website. The public can continue to provide comments on the HMP directly to ERM@smud.org and during public Board and Committee meetings. Any public input will be incorporated into the next formal HMP update process.

# Board Monitoring Report 2023
## SD-2, Competitive Rates

### 1. Background

Strategic Direction 2, Competitive Rates states that:

Maintaining competitive rates is a core value of SMUD.

Therefore:

a) The Board establishes a rate target of 18 percent below Pacific Gas & Electric Company's published rates on a system average basis. In addition, the Board establishes a rate target of at least 10 percent below PG&E’s published rates for each customer class.

b) SMUD’s rates shall be competitive with other local utilities on a system average basis.

c) In addition, SMUD’s rates shall be designed to balance and achieve the following goals:

i) Reflect the cost of energy when it is used or exported to the SMUD grid;  
ii) Reduce consumption during periods of high system demand;  
iii) Encourage energy efficiency, conservation, and carbon reduction;  
iv) Encourage cost effective and environmentally beneficial Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) (examples of DERs include but are not limited to rooftop solar, battery storage, and energy reduction applications);  
v) Minimize the rate of change in the transition from one rate design to another;  
vi) Provide customers flexibility and choices;  
vii) Be as simple and easy to understand as possible;  
viii) Address the needs of people with low incomes and severe medical conditions; and  
ix) Equitably allocate costs across and within customer classes.

### 2. Executive summary

a) SMUD is in compliance with SD-2, Competitive Rates.

As of December 31, 2023, SMUD’s rates remain among the lowest in the state and on a system average rate basis are 50.1% below Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) Company’s, which is better than the SD-2 target of at least 18% below on a system average rate basis. Residential average rates are at least 46.8% below PG&E’s residential average rates. See Figure 1 below for details.

There was one rate increase to SMUD’s rates in 2023. Rates for all customers were increased by 2% on January 1, 2023, as adopted by the Board on September 16, 2021. The overall rate advantage between SMUD and PG&E remains well above the SD-2 target of at least 18% on a system average basis.

2023 marked the continuation of several rate developments that balance the SD-2 requirements and help SMUD maintain our critical financial performance and metrics. In September, the Board approved Rate Resolution 23-09-09 which will allow SMUD to continue to meet California mandates, while addressing the impacts of the current economy and inflation. Despite these rate changes SMUD anticipates continuing to meet SD2 requirements in the future.

In September 2023 the board approved four 2.75% rate increases through 2025 with the first rate increase going into effect on January 1, 2024. These approved increases are, on average, lower than those of other electric utilities in the state of California. These increases are driven by commodity price increases, compliance requirements and inflation, among other things as described in Section 4 below.

The Time-of-Day (TOD) rate continues to encourage residential customers to shift usage out of the 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. peak time-period. On average, TOD rates deliver approximately 86-126MW of reduced load during SMUD's system peak.

### Additional supporting information
The Board establishes a rate target of 18% below PG&E’s published rates on a system average basis. In addition, the Board establishes a rate target of at least 10% below PG&E’s published rates for each customer class.

SMUD continues to maintain average rates that are lower than PG&E’s, both at a system level and by rate class. Figure 1 provides a detailed picture of the difference between SMUD’s and PG&E’s average rates by class in 2023 as well as the difference between rates in 2022.

Notes  
* Projected 2023 average prices for SMUD with rates effective 1-1-23. PG&E average prices in 2023 reflect rates effective 9-1-23, per Advice Letter 7009-E. The rate difference in year 2022 reflects PG&E average rates as of 6-1-22, per Advice Letter 6603-C dated 5-20-22, and SMUD rates effective 3-1-22.  
** CARE vs EAPR includes EAPR & EARMED customers.  
*** There is no indication from PG&E that their CARE rates include customers who have a medical allowance only.  
**** Commercial rates include WAPA credits.  

As seen in Figure 1, the rate competitiveness by class varies for the different customer classes and is at least 46.8% below comparable PG&E class average rates. Since the creation of this annual monitoring report, SMUD has consistently maintained rates that were more than 18% below PG&E. See Appendix A for more details.

b) SMUD’s rates shall be competitive with other local utilities on a system average basis.  

SMUD’s system average rate is competitive with other local utilities as shown in detail in Appendix B. In general, we are seeing large rate increases across the other local utilities. Even with our approved rate increases in 2024 and 2025, SMUD’s rates remain competitive. For example, Modesto recently approved a two-year rate increase of approximately 13% for 2024 and 2025; that’s in addition to an already adopted cumulative rate increase of 10.5% for 2023 and 2024. Roseville Electric is in the middle of proposing 2 rate increases of 9% each for 2024 and 2025. PG&E rates went up by 13% in 2023 alone, with a separate 17% rate increase effective January 2024.

c) Reflect the cost of energy when it is used or exported to the SMUD grid  

SMUD’s TOD and restructured commercial rates were designed to more closely reflect the cost of energy when it is used, with prices highest during the peak time periods when the cost of energy is highest. We continually assess our rates as markets and our costs change to determine if any structural changes are needed. For example, we implemented TOD rates in 2018 and restructured our commercial rates in 2021.

d) Reduce consumption during periods of high system demand  

Both the residential and commercial TOD rates send signals to customers to reduce their on-peak usage. The Peak time for residential customers is 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. while the Peak time for commercial customers under the restructured rates is 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. These Peak time periods reflect the highest $/kWh to encourage customers to shift their energy usage outside of the Peak time-period to reduce system load and help with carbon reduction goals.  

The optional residential Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) rate charges a premium on energy delivered during those few critical times during the summer with highest demand, which is expected to reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions when the grid is most stressed. Additionally, customers on the CPP rate receive a discount on energy delivered during the summer Off-Peak and Mid-Peak time periods, encouraging them to shift their energy use to times when the grid is less stressed and clean energy is more abundant.

e) Encourage energy efficiency, conservation, and carbon reduction  

SMUD continues to encourage energy efficiency, conservation and carbon reduction through the residential and non-residential TOD rates and a variety of programs, such as incentives to install storage, and offering a variety of rebates for energy-efficient appliances, heating and cooling systems, and energy-efficient LED lighting. TOD rates encourage

customers to shift energy use from peak times when energy is more costly and is produced by a larger portion of carbon-emitting generation plants to off-peak times, when there is often excess carbon-free solar generation on our system. By shifting usage to times when non-carbon emitting resources are plentiful, customers not only save money, but they also contribute to reducing carbon emissions and help SMUD achieve our carbon reduction goals. The residential and restructured commercial TOD rates were designed to be revenue neutral, so customers can save money if they shift or reduce their usage from peak hours. More detailed information about rebates and savings tips can be found on smud.org.

f) Encourage cost effective and environmentally beneficial Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) (examples of DERs include but are not limited to rooftop solar, battery storage, and energy reduction applications)

The Solar and Storage Rate (SSR) was designed to work with a series of programs and incentives to help SMUD reach its 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. SMUD started the My Energy Optimizer (MEO) incentives and expanded storage incentives to encourage customers to invest in storage, which could enable the customer to gain additional value from their investment. In addition to the storage incentives, the CPP rate provides customers with solar and storage even more of an opportunity to increase the value of their system, by providing a significantly larger incentive to send power to the grid during critical events. The CPP rate also encourage customers to adopt smart thermostats, as they may be able to save money the CPP rate if they use the thermostats to adjust their energy usage.

Customers that live in low-income, multi-family affordable housing will be able to receive the benefits of solar through the Virtual Solar Option. In the Virtual Solar Option, the building owner may install solar, and the benefits of that solar will be allocated to the residents, providing an avenue for customers to adopt solar even though they do not own their own home.

g) Minimize the rate of change in the transition from one rate design to another

SMUD follows this principle through gradualism and balance between rate implementation and customer satisfaction when making rate structure changes in combination with rate increases. For example, the Commercial Rate Restructure will be phased in over an 8-year period to mitigate bill impacts.

h) Provide customers flexibility and choices

SMUD provides flexibility and rate options to its customers. Residential customers may select custom due dates, budget billing, and net energy metering customers can choose between monthly or annual settlement options. Residential customers are placed on TOD, but they may select the fixed rate or the CPP rate. All customers may make online payments and set up billing alerts. In addition, qualified commercial customers moving to SMUD’s service area may choose between two different Economic Development Rate discount structures, selecting the option that best suits their needs.

SMUD is offering three levels of incentives for customers to install storage. The amount of the incentive increases depending on which programs the customers decide to participate in. The smallest incentive, MEO Starter, is for customers that do not wish to participate in a program, the next highest level, MEO Partner, is for customers that want to participate in the CPP rate, and the highest incentive, MEO Partner+, is for customers that want to participate.

in the Virtual Power Plant program. Detailed information about storage incentives can be found on smud.org.

i) Be as simple and easy to understand as possible

SMUD works to make sure its many programs and rates are simple and easy to understand. For example, staff designed the TOD rate and restructured commercial rates to balance simplicity while still reflecting the cost of energy when it is used. Ongoing customer outreach and education assists customers in understanding new rate designs, pilots and programs.

j) Address the needs of people with low incomes and severe medical conditions

SMUD continues to address low-income customers and those with medical conditions. The Energy Assistance Program Rate (EAPR) and our Medical Equipment Discount Rate (MED Rate) offer customers a discount on their monthly energy costs for those that qualify. The discount for EAPR is determined by Federal Poverty Level (FPL) with the largest discount going to those that need the most assistance. In September 2023, the Board approved the EAPR Rate Stabilization Fund which gives an additional discount to those customers with the greatest need, using discretionary, non-retail funds.

Additionally, through the EAPR and MED Rate discount program we have assisted nearly 2,000 customers with energy education, energy efficient improvements and repairs, and moved them towards our Clean Energy Vision with building and transportation electrification improvements. These programs improve/reduce their overall burden and increase the comfort of their homes.

k) Equitably allocate costs across and within customer classes

To ensure costs are equitably allocated across and within customer classes, staff updates SMUD’s marginal cost study and performs rate costing studies and value of solar studies prior to recommending rate structure changes, such as with TOD, the Commercial Rate Restructure and SSR.

4) Challenges

Rate Pressures

SMUD continues to face cost pressures for compliance and risk mitigation requirements, as well as technology and grid investments to support the safe and reliable operation of the grid. Commodity costs to meet our reliability Renewable Portfolio Standards requirements are increased by $87 million in 2024, along with an increase of $370 million of capital spending to fund new generation, storage projects, substation and line capacity projects in 2024 and 2025. In addition, increased costs for wildfire management, reliability of our hydro facilities, customer programs to support our clean energy vision, and inflation all added pressure to maintaining SMUD’s bottom line. These rate pressures were the drivers and detailed in the 2023 GM Report.

5) Recommendation

It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD 2, Competitive Rates.

## Appendix B: Local Utility Rates

- **Modesto Irrigation District (MID)**: On November 15, 2022, MID approved rate increases of 7.4% effective January 2023 and an additional 3.5% for 2024. On November 14, 2023, the MID Board of Directors approved another round of rate increases of 7.5% for January 2024, and a subsequent 5.5% increase for 2025 to cover costs and power supply cost pressure. A Power Cost Adjustment designed to reflect fluctuating power supply costs was also adopted and will be calculated and applied monthly to customer bills in 2025.

- **Turlock Irrigation District (TID)**: TID has not had a base rate increase since 2015 and there is no indication the utility plans to modify its base rates in 2024. There is no change planned to the Power Supply Adjustment at the moment.

- **Roseville Electric**: Roseville Electric has scheduled three public rate workshops in January 2024 to explain the need of additional rate increases for 2024 and 2025, however they will continue their 8% energy surcharge through December 31, 2024. The utility states that the need for new rate increases is due to several factors, including

![Figure 3 – 2022 Utility System Average Rate Comparison ($/kWh)](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf)

- **Lodi Electric**: On June 7, 2023, the Lodi City Council adopted a rate increase of 2% effective August 2023 for fiscal year 2023-24 and 2% effective July 2024 for fiscal year 2024-25. The staff report describes that the additional needed revenue is being collected through an increase to the monthly customer charge which is intended to cover the fixed costs of the utility – those costs that do not change based on the amount of energy. Lodi also has a monthly energy cost adjustment that adjusts as power costs increase or decrease. The range of the energy cost adjustment for 2023 was -$0.0377/kWh to $0.0671/kWh.

- **Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP)**: LADWP did not have a base rate increase in fiscal year 2022-2023. LADWP does have a pass-through rate mechanism that adjusts quarterly with costs, outside of any base rate increases. This Energy Cost Adjustment (ECA) ranged between $0.10213 and $0.10369 for 2023.

SMUD’s system average rate remains competitive, as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 uses 2022 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), which is the most recent actual yearly data available. 2023 values are based on averaged monthly figures through October 2023. Roseville and Lodi do not participate in the reporting of monthly data. System average rates in dollars per kWh is a typical benchmark used in the industry to compare rates and are calculated by taking total electric revenue and dividing it by total kWh retail sales.

Including pass-through mechanisms in rates is a common utility practice, allowing utilities to collect enough revenue to cover their costs without having to increase rates in a formal rate proceeding. SMUD has the Hydro Generation Adjustment, which allows for a small additional charge.

**Overview of PG&E’s recent rate proceedings**

In 2023 PG&E had five rate changes, increasing the system average rate in $/kWh from $0.2803 in 2022 to $0.3133 in 2023 as shown in Figure 6.

**Figure 6 – PG&E 2022-2023 Rate Changes**

*Includes California Climate Credit

**PG&E Rate Increase Process**

Every three to four years PG&E files a request with California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) with their proposed rate increases. Per the most recent filing dated 12/29/2023, which reflects the true-up and General Rate Case (GRC), PG&E will increase its rates by 17.1% on average effective January 1, 2024.

For 2024, most of the increase is driven by the GRC which supports the continued implementation of the utility’s wildfire mitigation plan, a large portion of which is “undergrounding” 1,230+ miles of lines where wildfire risk is high. Other driving factors include the need to meet growing energy demand and the addition of more renewables.

PG&E is awaiting a decision from the CPUC on their proposed Income-Graduated Fixed Charge, expected sometime in 2024.

Figures 7 and 8 show the comparison to PG&E rates for each step of SMUD’s rate increases in 2024. The charts show that even with the increases, the difference between PG&E's and SMUD's rates still far exceed the directive of SD-2.

1. **Background**  
   Strategic Direction 3 on Access to Credit Markets states that:  
   Maintaining access to credit is a core value of SMUD.  
   Therefore:  
   a. For SMUD’s annual budgets, the Board establishes a minimum target of cash coverage of all debt service payments (fixed charge ratio) of 1.50 times.  
   b. When making resource decisions, SMUD shall weigh the impacts on long-term revenue requirements, debt, financial risk and flexibility.  
   c. SMUD’s goal is to maintain at least an “A” rating with credit rating agencies.  

2. **Executive summary**  
   SMUD relies on the use of borrowed funds to pay for a portion of its capital needs on an ongoing basis. The Board adopted SD-3, Access to Credit Markets, to help ensure that SMUD maintains the ability to raise new money at competitive rates in the bond market as needed. Making prudent use of borrowed funds to finance capital improvements can help SMUD to mitigate major rate adjustments in periods of intensive capital expansion, and allows SMUD to allocate the costs of those improvements over their useful lives to the customers who benefit from them. Maintaining access to credit markets supports our objective to be financially flexible to make necessary and timely investment and take advantage of opportunities while remaining competitive.  
   One of the most important indicators of an organization’s ability to access credit markets is the independent assessment made by credit rating agencies. SMUD is rated by the three major rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s (S&P), Moody’s, and Fitch, which review SMUD’s credit on approximately an annual basis. The credit ratings assigned are intended to give investors the rating agency’s view of the likelihood that SMUD will repay principal and pay interest on bonds when due. They utilize financial metrics in assessing creditworthiness such as the Fixed Charge Ratio that measures revenue sufficiency to meet obligations, and Days Cash on Hand, a measure of liquidity. They also measure leverage and the capacity to finance future capital projects without placing undue burden on customers, either through borrowing or within our rate structure. SMUD’s overall governance and risk

management practices are also important to the agencies, along with the ability and willingness to raise rates when necessary while maintaining competitive low-cost energy for our customers.

As indicated in the attached ratings agency reports, SMUD demonstrates robust metrics, and, thanks to well-managed cash flow, has the flexibility to target a more conservative fixed charge ratio. The most recent SMUD credit reports from both S&P and Fitch also specifically cite the Board’s demonstrated willingness to raise rates to support financial performance.

Credit ratings heavily impact an organization’s ability to borrow money in the municipal markets, as well as the interest rates they will be required to pay. Higher credit ratings translate into lower borrowing costs. For example, if SMUD’s credit ratings were to fall into a lower category, from AA to A, the impact at today’s rates would be approximately $373k/year for every $100 million borrowed. During a period of financial turmoil, as experienced in early 2020, higher credit ratings allowed SMUD to access credit markets sooner, more easily, and at a lower interest rate than lower rated utilities.

Credit ratings also impact an organization’s ability to conduct general business transactions. Trading partners utilize credit ratings as a factor in assessing their willingness to transact with SMUD, and to determine commercial terms. Stronger credit ratings enable SMUD to negotiate better terms and conditions for contracts, including power purchase agreements, and commercial insurance policies. For example, SMUD’s healthy credit ratings minimize the amount of collateral posting required under many of its commodity contracts to hedge natural gas and power. Likewise, if SMUD’s ratings were to drop from current levels, collateral posting requirements would increase accordingly. In some cases, a reduction in SMUD’s credit ratings below a certain threshold gives our counterparty the right to terminate the contract.

In addition to cash on hand, SMUD maintains a liquidity program consisting of a commercial paper program and a line of credit. The commercial paper program enables SMUD the ability to issue up to $300 million of commercial paper notes to obtain funding quickly, when it’s necessary to maintain our liquidity levels. Similarly the line of credit allows SMUD access to up to $100 million on short notice but has the advantage that it isn’t dependent on investor demand. The commercial paper program and line of credit are instrumental in providing comprehensive liquidity support for its operations and capital initiatives. The liquidity program helps to maintain our credit ratings and mitigate many enterprise risks that are otherwise difficult or financially prohibitive to mitigate through standard means. The commercial paper program and line of credit are structured with agreements from three separate banks, further reducing concentration risk and enhancing overall execution.

In support of maintaining SMUD’s financial strength, credit ratings, and to help mitigate risk SMUD procures insurance. SMUD maintains comprehensive property and casualty insurance programs designed to protect against catastrophic losses that would adversely effect its financial position or operational capabilities. Insurance programs are continuously reviewed and modified when construction, operational exposures, or developments in the insurance industry so warrant. SMUD’s strong financial position, long term relationships with a variety of insurers, and its liquidity program minimize SMUD’s susceptibility to the volatility of insurance market cycles. SMUD maintains cash on hand and access to credit to meet potential insurance deductibles and self-insured liability claims and has had no claims that have exceeded coverage limits.

SMUD has remained in compliance with SD-3 as evidenced by the following:

a. Maintained key financial metrics, including a fixed charge ratio above the minimum policy target of 1.50 times.
   1. 1.65 times in 2022
   2. 2.32 times in 2023 (forecasted figure as of December 31, 2023)
   3. 2.08 times in 2024 (projected in 2024 Budget)

b. In 2023, credit ratings were affirmed at 'AA' by both S&P and Fitch, while Moody’s had previously affirmed 'Aa3' with a positive outlook in 2022, equivalent to 'AA-'.

c. Refunded the 2013 Series A bonds by issuing variable rate bonds, and entering into a standby bond purchase agreement to provide liquidity for the bonds. The variable rate bonds are converted into a fixed interest rate due to an interest rate swap entered into in 2020. This synthetically fixed bond issuance locked in the refunding’s interest rates, generating annual cash flow savings of $3.3 million to 5.3 million through 2041, which is equivalent to $55.5 million in net present value savings or $79.9 million cash flow savings.

d. In conjunction with the issuance of variable bonds, SMUD successfully established a new Standby Bond Purchase Agreement (SBPA) with TD Bank. Leveraging SMUD’s robust AA credit rating, we received a range of SBPA offers, culminating in the execution of an agreement with TD Bank featuring highly competitive pricing.

e. Refunded the 2013 Series B bonds with fixed rate bonds and terminated the associated interest rate swap entered into in 2020. This transaction reduced risk and locked in the savings from the refunding, generating annual cash flow savings of $1.7 million through 2033, which is equivalent to $14.3 million in net present value savings, or $18.1 million cash flow savings.

f. Successfully mitigated interest rate risk in a volatile market environment by strategically refunding $200 million worth of Commercial Paper through the issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt. This transaction, which also was SMUD’s first ever Climate Bond certified Green Bond issuance, also ensured that the entire $400 million capacity remains available to meet our future borrowing requirements to support our capital improvement program and Zero Carbon Plan.

g. Accessed credit markets with multiple issuances and rollovers of commercial paper totaling $150 million outstanding by the end of 2023. The commercial paper issuances were to support SMUD’s liquidity needs and capital improvement program.

h. Additional supplemental contributions of $44 million were made to CalPERS. This was part of a 10-year pension funding strategy to eliminate our unfunded pension liability, which is an obligation rating agencies are increasingly focusing on in their reviews. Addressing the unfunded liability sooner will help control rate increases. These costs would continue to grow into the future since paying only the required minimum payments may not fully mitigate the compounding nature of the outstanding liability adequately. SMUD’s most current valuations show the Pension funded status at 88% as of June 30, 2022, and the funded status of Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) at 92% as of June 30, 2023.

i. Continued to successfully manage the property and casualty insurance programs amidst a historically challenging market, renewing most programs within expiring terms and conditions. Obtaining wildfire coverage remains a challenge, but even in this tumultuous market SMUD successfully increased the program limit by $25 million, and reduced the self-insured portion of the first $100 million layer by $12.5 million.

j. Negotiated a $50 million advance payment on the anticipated claim recovery for the Cosumnes Power Plant (CPP) steam turbine failure insurance claim. SMUD also settled the property damage claim for the CPP steam turbine failure which resulted in SMUD receiving a $13.6 million payment.

**RESOLUTION NO. 24-02-09**

WHEREAS, the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) platform, originally implemented in 2009 and partially funded by SMUD’s SmartSacramento Grid Investment Grant, is comprised of communication infrastructure equipment (smart meters), a communication network, and back-office systems; and

WHEREAS, in 2021 and 2022, as part of SMUD’s Next Generation AMI Roadmap, use cases supporting the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan were analyzed and next generation smart meters were identified as a key enabling technology required to support many of the use cases due to their advanced functionality and additional data granularity; and

WHEREAS, in October 2023, SMUD was awarded a $50 million grant from the Department of Energy Grid Deployment Office’s (DOE) Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program, wherein Itron Networked Solutions, Inc. (Itron) was a named partner, for new technologies to increase reliability, efficiency, and flexibility of the electric grid; and

WHEREAS, as part of the GRIP grant, beginning in September 2024 and continuing through 2025, SMUD will deploy 200,000 Itron Riva edge computing sensors with measurement capabilities (smart meters) and eight Distributed Intelligence (DI) applications; and

WHEREAS, by Resolution No. 23-12-05, adopted on December 14, 2023, this Board authorized sole source Contract No. 4600001818 with Itron for a one-year term in the amount of $15 million, plus applicable taxes and fees, for the initial purchase of meters due to global supply chain lead time constraints of 12-plus months; and

WHEREAS, Itron is the only metering manufacturer with a commercially available DI-enabled meter and associated DI applications deployed at scale, has the only DI-enabled meter compatible with SMUD’s existing AMI mesh network and existing back-office system, is a named partner in the GRIP grant, and does not have any resellers; and
<!-- Page 232 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/1265x768.png?text=Document+Image)  

**WHEREAS**, the Itron Riva edge computing sensors (smart meters) with measurement capabilities are priced very competitively (within 11% on average compared to SMUD’s existing legacy smart meters that lack the DI-enabled capabilities) and the cost per meter for the most common form factors is within 9% of their legacy smart meter equivalents; and  

**WHEREAS**, costs for software and professional services are found to be competitive when compared to other software products and associated professional services purchased by SMUD and thus are considered fair and reasonable; and  

**WHEREAS**, it would not be productive or in the best interest of SMUD to advertise for competitive bids for the products and services referred to above because they can only be obtained from Itron; NOW, THEREFORE,  

**BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT**:  

**Section 1.** That the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his designee, is authorized on behalf of SMUD to negotiate and execute a sole source Master Services Agreement with Itron Networked Solutions, Inc. to purchase hardware, software, and professional services to enhance the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) platform in an amount not to exceed $42,500,000.  

**Section 2.** The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his designee, is authorized to make future changes to the terms and conditions of the contract that, in his prudent judgment: (a) further the primary purpose of the contract; (b) are intended to provide a net benefit to SMUD; and (c) do not exceed the authorized contract amount and applicable contingencies.

**SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED FEE LETTER**  
**DATED FEBRUARY [__], 2024**

Reference is hereby made to (i) that certain Reimbursement Agreement dated as of February 1, 2019 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof, the “Agreement”), between the SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT, a municipal utility district of the State of California (“SMUD”), and BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. (the “Bank”), relating to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Commercial Paper Notes, Series M (the “Notes”), (ii) that certain Irrevocable Letter of Credit dated February 28, 2019, issued by the Bank pursuant to the Agreement, supporting the Notes (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof, the “Letter of Credit”), and (iii) that certain Amended and Restated Fee Letter dated February 23, 2022 (the “Existing Fee Letter”) between SMUD and the Bank. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Agreement or the Letter of Credit, as applicable.

SMUD has requested that the Bank make certain modifications to the Existing Fee Letter and, for the sake of clarity and convenience, the Bank and SMUD wish to amend and restate the Existing Fee Letter in its entirety. This Second Amended and Restated Fee Letter dated the date first written above (this “Fee Letter”) amends and restates the Existing Fee Letter in its entirety. SMUD acknowledges and agrees that all fees previously paid to the Bank under the Existing Fee Letter are fully earned and non-refundable. The purpose of this Fee Letter is to confirm the agreement between the Bank and SMUD with respect to, among other things, the Letter of Credit Fees (as defined below) and certain other fees payable to the Bank. This Fee Letter is the “Fee Letter” referenced in the Agreement and the terms hereof are incorporated by reference into the Agreement. This Fee Letter and the Agreement are to be construed as one agreement between SMUD and the Bank, and all obligations hereunder are to be construed as obligations thereunder. All references to amounts due and payable under the Agreement will be deemed to include amounts, fees, and expenses payable under this Fee Letter. All amounts, fees, and expenses due and payable prior to February [__]1, 2024, shall be paid pursuant to the terms of the Existing Fee Letter; meaning, for purposes of clarity that the Letter of Credit Fees for the period from and including January 2, 2024, to but excluding February [__], 2024, shall be determined under the Existing Fee Letter and payable on April 1, 2024.

**ARTICLE I. FEES AND OTHER AGREEMENTS.**

**Section 1.1. Letter of Credit Fees.** SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank on April 1, 2024, for the period commencing on February [__], 2024 to and including March 31, 2024, and quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day of each July, October, January and April (each, a “Quarterly Payment Date”) occurring prior to the Termination Date, and on the Termination Date, non-refundable facility fees (the “Letter of Credit Fees”) for each day in the related fee period in the amounts determined as set forth below.

<!-- Page 256 -->
(i) Defined Terms. As used in this Section 1.1:

(A) “Letter of Credit Fee Rate” shall mean the rate per annum corresponding to the Rating (as defined below), as specified in the applicable Level in the below applicable pricing matrix for each day in the related fee period.

(B) “Stated Amount” shall mean the Original Stated Amount (i) less the amount of all prior reductions pursuant to drawings with respect to the payment at maturity of the principal of and interest at maturity of the Notes, (ii) less the amount of any reduction thereof pursuant to a reduction certificate in the form of Annex B to the Letter of Credit, (iii) plus the amount of all reinstatements as provided in the Letter of Credit.

(ii) For the period commencing on February [__], 2024 to but excluding April 1, 2025, the Letter of Credit Fees shall be an amount equal to the product of (i) the Letter of Credit Fee Rate determined in accordance with the pricing matrix set forth below, times (ii) the Stated Amount (without regard to any reduction of the Stated Amount subject to reinstatement) for each day in the related fee period.

| LEVEL | MOODY’S RATING | S&P RATING | FITCH RATING | LETTER OF CREDIT FEE RATE |
|-------|----------------|------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Level 1 | Aa3 or above | AA- or above | AA- or above | 0.29% |
| Level 2 | A1 | A+ | A+ | 0.39% |
| Level 3 | A2 | A | A | 0.49% |
| Level 4 | A3 | A- | A- | 0.59% |
| Level 5 | Baa1 | BBB+ | BBB+ | 0.69% |
| Level 6 | Baa2 | BBB | BBB | 0.79% |
| Level 7 | Baa3 | BBB- | BBB- | 0.89% |

(iii) For the period commencing on April 1, 2025 and at all times thereafter, the Letter of Credit Fees shall be an amount equal to the product of (i) the Letter of Credit Fee Rate determined in accordance with the pricing matrix set forth below, times (ii) the Stated Amount (without regard to any reduction of the Stated Amount subject to reinstatement) for each day in the related fee period.

|-------|----------------|------------|--------------|---------------------------|

| Level 2 | A1 | A+ | A+ | 0.42% |

**MOODY’S** | **FITCH** | **LETTER OF CREDIT**  
**LEVEL** | **RATING** | **S&P RATING** | **RATING** | **FEE RATE**  
Level 3 | A2 | A | A | 0.52%  
Level 4 | A3 | A- | A- | 0.62%  
Level 5 | Baa1 | BBB+ | BBB+ | 0.72%  
Level 6 | Baa2 | BBB | BBB | 0.82%  
Level 7 | Baa3 | BBB- | BBB- | 0.92%  

The following paragraphs shall apply to all pricing matrices set forth above. The term “Rating” as used herein shall mean the long-term unenhanced debt rating assigned by Moody’s, Fitch and S&P to any Debt of SMUD secured by or payable from Net Revenues on a parity with Bonds and Parity Bonds. In the event of a split rating (i.e., the Rating of one of the Rating Agencies’ is different than the Rating of any of the other Rating Agencies), the Letter of Credit Fee Rate shall be based upon the Level in which the lowest of the two highest Ratings appears (for the avoidance of doubt, Level 7 is the Level with the lowest Ratings and Level 1 is the Level with the highest Ratings for purposes of the above pricing grids). In the event that less than three Rating Agencies then assign a long-term unenhanced debt rating to Bonds and Parity Bonds, the Letter of Credit Fee Rate shall be based upon the Level in which the lower Rating appears. Any change in the Letter of Credit Fee Rate resulting from a change in a Rating shall be deemed effective as of and on the date of the announcement of the change in such Rating. References to ratings levels above are references to rating categories as presently determined by the Rating Agencies and in the event of adoption of any new or changed rating system, including, without limitation, any recalibration or realignment of Rating in connection with the adoption of a “global” rating scale, the rating from the Rating Agency in question referred to above shall be deemed to refer to the rating category under the new rating system that most closely approximates the applicable rating category as currently in effect. In the event that a Rating is suspended or withdrawn (for the avoidance of doubt, a decision by SMUD to cause a Rating Agency to no longer maintain its Rating, for non-credit related reasons and not for the purpose of avoiding the occurrence of an event of default, shall not constitute a suspension or withdrawal of such Rating) from any Rating Agency or upon the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Letter of Credit Fee Rate shall increase to the sum of the Letter of Credit Fee Rate specified above for Level 7 in the applicable pricing matrix above plus 1.50% per annum. The Letter of Credit Fees shall be payable as set forth above, together with interest on the Letter of Credit Fees from the date payment is due until payment in full at the Default Rate.

For the avoidance of doubt, at all times prior to February [ __ ], 2024, the Letter of Credit Fees shall be payable and determined in accordance with the Existing Fee Letter.

**Section 1.2. Annual Draw Fee.** SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank a non-refundable draw fee of $2,000, which shall be paid annually in advance within thirty (30) days of receipt of an invoice from the Bank.

**Section 1.3. Amendment Fee.** SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank on the date of any amendment, modification or supplement to the Agreement, the Letter of Credit or this Fee Letter or in connection with any amendment to any Program Document which requires a waiver from, or the consent of, the Bank, a non-refundable amendment fee in an amount equal to $2,500, plus the reasonable fees of any legal counsel retained by the Bank in connection therewith.

**Section 1.4. Transfer Fee.** SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank on the date of each transfer of the Letter of Credit to a successor Depositary, a non-refundable transfer fee in an amount equal to $2,500, plus the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Bank in connection therewith.

**Section 1.5. Termination Fee; Reduction Fee.** (a) SMUD hereby agrees to pay to the Bank a termination fee in connection with any termination or replacement of the Letter of Credit by SMUD prior to February 21, 2025, in an amount equal to the difference between (A) the product of (i) the Letter of Credit Fee Rate in effect on the date of such termination or replacement under the applicable pricing matrix above, (ii) the Stated Amount in effect as of the Second Amendment Effective Date and (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of days from and including the date of such termination or replacement to and including February 21, 2025, and the denominator of which is 360, and (B) any amount paid to the Bank pursuant to Section 1.5(b) hereof (the “Termination Fee”), payable on the date of such termination or replacement; provided, however, that no such Termination Fee shall be payable if (i) the short-term unenhanced ratings of the Bank are reduced below “P-1” (or its equivalent), “A-1” (or its equivalent) or “F1” (or its equivalent), by any two of Moody’s, S&P or Fitch, respectively; (ii) the Notes are refinanced in full from the proceeds of fixed rate long-term debt issuance or a source of funds which, in either case, does not involve the issuance by a bank or other financial institution; or (iii) the Bank imposes on SMUD increased costs pursuant to Section 2.14 of the Agreement; provided that this clause (ii) shall not be construed to relieve SMUD of any of its obligations under Section 2.14 of the Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing and anything set forth herein or in the Agreement to the contrary, SMUD agrees not to permanently reduce the Stated Amount below the Stated Amount in effect as of the Second Amendment Effective Date prior to February 21, 2025, without the payment by SMUD to the Bank of a reduction fee in connection with each and every permanent reduction of the Stated Amount in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Letter of Credit Fee Rate in effect under the applicable pricing matrix above on the date of such reduction, (ii) the difference between the Stated Amount (without regard to any reduction of the Stated Amount subject to reinstatement) prior to such reduction and the Stated Amount (without regard to any reduction of the Stated Amount subject to reinstatement) after such reduction, and (iii) a fraction, the numerator of which is equal to the number of days from and including the date of such reduction to and including February 21, 2025, and the denominator of which is 360 (the “Reduction Fee”); provided, however, that no such Reduction Fee shall be payable if (i) the short-term unenhanced ratings of the Bank are reduced below “P-1” (or its equivalent), “A-1” (or its equivalent) or “F1” (or its equivalent), by any two of Moody’s, S&P or Fitch, respectively; (ii) the Notes are refinanced in full from the proceeds of fixed rate long-term debt issuance or a source of funds which, in either case, does not involve the issuance by a bank or other financial institution.

**SUMMARY**

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) was formed by vote of the electors in 1923 under provisions of the California Municipal Utility District Act (Division 6 of the California Public Utilities Code) (the “Act”). The Act provides SMUD with broad powers to acquire, construct, own and operate works for the supplying of light, water, heat, power, communications, transportation and other services for its inhabitants. The Act also confers upon SMUD the necessary rights and powers for the conduct of business, including the right to sue and be sued, to exercise the power of eminent domain, to enter into contracts of all kinds, to take property and construct works, to fix rates and charges for commodities or services furnished, to incur indebtedness and issue bonds or other obligations and to invest its funds.

SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities. SMUD’s headquarters are located in the city of Sacramento (the “City”) and its service area of approximately 900 square miles includes the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. The service area includes the state capital, the City, the populous areas principally to the northeast and south of the City and the agricultural areas to the north and south. The City is located 85 miles northeast of San Francisco.

The Commercial Paper Notes, Series M consisting of Subseries M-1 and Subseries M-2 (the “Subseries M-1 Notes” and the “Subseries M-2 Notes” and, collectively, the “Notes”) are secured by a package of Available Revenues, as described herein and supported by an irrevocable, transferable, direct-pay letter of credit, as amended (the “Letter of Credit”) in substantially the form attached hereto as Appendix A and issued by Bank of America, N.A. (the “Bank”) pursuant to a Reimbursement Agreement between SMUD and the Bank, dated as of February 1, 2019, as amended (the “Reimbursement Agreement”). The Bank has issued the Letter of Credit in the aggregate maximum stated amount of $256,164,384 (consisting of $250,000,000 principal plus ninety (90) days interest calculated at a rate of 10% per annum assuming a 365-day year). The Notes will be issued in book-entry form through the Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). See “The Commercial Paper Notes” herein.

This material relating to SMUD is for general informational purposes. While SMUD considers the material relating to SMUD reliable, SMUD does not represent that it is a complete and accurate disclosure of the facts pertaining to SMUD. Investors are expected to base their investment decisions solely on the liquidity and credit support provided by the Bank, rather than the financial and operating history of SMUD, which this Commercial Paper Memorandum does not purport to fully disclose. Additional information about SMUD is available from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board’s (the “MSRB”) Electronic Municipal Access System (“EMMA”). See also “Additional Information” herein.

If for any reason the Bank fails to honor a properly presented and conforming drawing under the Letter of Credit, SMUD cannot provide any assurance that it will have sufficient funds on hand and available to make such payment of principal of and/or interest on the Notes supported by the Letter of Credit or to make such payments in a timely manner.

**Prospective investors should therefore base their investment decision primarily on the credit of the Bank, rather than on that of SMUD.**

BofA Securities, Inc., as dealer of the Notes (the "Dealer") has provided the following sentence for inclusion in this Commercial Paper Memorandum. The Dealer has reviewed the information in this Commercial Paper Memorandum in accordance with, and as part of, its responsibilities to investors under the federal securities law as applied to the facts and circumstances of this transaction, but the Dealer does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information.

**THE COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES**

SMUD is issuing the Notes pursuant to (a) Articles 6a and 6b of Chapter 6 of the Act (California Public Utilities Code Section 12850 et seq.), (b) Chapter 7.5 of the Act (California Public Utilities Code Section 13371 et seq.) and (c) Article 11 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code (California Government Code Section 53580 et seq.). Resolution No. 19-02-02 of SMUD, adopted on February 21, 2019, as supplemented and amended by Resolution No. 22-02-06 of SMUD, adopted on February 17, 2022, and by Resolution No. 24-02-__ of SMUD, adopted on February 15, 2024 (collectively, the "Resolution"), provides that Notes may be outstanding in an aggregate principal amount that does not exceed $250,000,000. The proceeds of the Notes may be used by SMUD to finance or refinance capital improvements, certain costs associated with the purchase of fuel, facilities design, site preparation, the acquisition of equipment, and to pay maturing Notes.

The Notes are secured by a pledge of Available Revenues and supported by the Letter of Credit. The Letter of Credit has been issued pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement. Available Revenues of SMUD are composed of net revenues of SMUD after payment of operating, maintenance, and purchased power expenses, Rate Stabilization Fund deposits, and debt service and reserves on SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds and Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds, all as provided in the Resolution.

The Notes will be issued as book-entry obligations evidenced by a master note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. The Notes may be issued in denominations of $100,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess of $100,000, with interest payable at maturity, and shall mature on such dates as SMUD may establish, provided that no Note shall mature more than 270 days from the date of issuance thereof. Subseries M-1 Notes shall bear interest on the basis of a 365- or 366-day year, as applicable, and the actual number of days elapsed and Subseries M-2 Notes shall bear interest on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. The Notes are payable at the principal office of U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association (the "Depositary").

Pursuant to the Depositary Agreement relating to the Notes, dated February 28, 2019 (the "Depositary Agreement"), between SMUD and the Depositary, the Depositary is not permitted to authenticate and deliver any Note if, immediately after the authentication and delivery thereof, the aggregate face amount of the Outstanding Notes plus the maximum amount of interest which may accrue thereon would exceed the aggregate Letter of Credit Stated Amount.

**(defined herein). SMUD has also covenanted in the Resolution not to issue any Note if, after its issuance, the outstanding principal amount of all Notes as well as interest to accrue on such Notes would exceed the then current Letter of Credit Stated Amount. See "Bank Credit Arrangement" herein.**

# BANK CREDIT ARRANGEMENT

**Stated Amount and Term of the Letter of Credit.** Pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement, the Bank has issued to the Depositary the Letter of Credit in the aggregate maximum stated amount of $256,164,384 (consisting of $250,000,000 principal plus 90 days interest calculated at a rate of 10% per annum assuming a 365-day year) as reduced and reinstated from time to time in accordance with terms of the Letter of Credit (the “Letter of Credit Stated Amount”). The Letter of Credit’s stated expiration date is February [__], 20[__], unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, and unless such expiration date is extended by the Bank in accordance with the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement.

**Drawings under the Letter of Credit.** The Depositary is authorized to make drawings under the Letter of Credit in accordance with its terms. If demand for payment under the Letter of Credit is properly presented as provided therein and in conformity with the requirements thereof, payment shall be made by the Bank to the Depositary, in immediately available funds, at such times as provided in and in accordance with the provisions of the Letter of Credit. All payments made by the Bank under the Letter of Credit shall be made with the Bank’s own funds.

If for any reason the Bank fails to honor a properly presented and conforming drawing under the Letter of Credit, SMUD cannot provide any assurance that it will have sufficient funds on hand and available to make such payment of principal and/or interest on the Notes supported by the Letter of Credit or to make such payments in a timely manner. Prospective investors should therefore base their investment decision primarily on the credit of the Bank, rather than on that of SMUD.

**Reimbursement of Drawings under the Letter of Credit.** Drawings made under the Letter of Credit to pay interest due on the Notes are required to be reimbursed by SMUD on the date of such drawing. Drawings made under the Letter of Credit to pay the principal of the Notes if not reimbursed by SMUD in full on the date of such drawing will, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions of the Reimbursement Agreement, automatically convert to and constitute and advance made by the Bank to SMUD (an “Advance”) to be paid in installments on (a) the first business day to occur on or after the six (6) month anniversary of the date the related Advance is made and the first business day of each sixth (6th) calendar month occurring thereafter prior to the related Amortization End Date and (b) the related Amortization End Date. The “Amortization End Date” means, with respect to any Advance, the earliest to occur of: (i) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date on which the related Advance was made, (ii) the date on which an Alternate Letter of Credit (defined herein) becomes effective in substitution of the Letter of Credit with respect to the Notes, and (iii) the date on which the Letter of Credit Stated Amount is permanently reduced to zero or the Letter of Credit is otherwise terminated in accordance with its terms prior to its stated expiration date.

![Events of Default under the Reimbursement Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Events+of+Default+under+the+Reimbursement+Agreement)

**Events of Default under the Reimbursement Agreement.** The Reimbursement Agreement contains certain events of default by SMUD, including, but not limited to, an event of default under the Program Documents, the Master Bond Resolution or the Subordinate Bond Resolution (each as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement), a failure by SMUD to reimburse the Bank for a drawing under the Letter of Credit when due under the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement or a payment default or certain other defaults with respect to certain other obligations of SMUD, subject to such grace periods as are provided for in the Reimbursement Agreement, material misrepresentation or breach of covenant by SMUD, subject to such grace periods as are provided for in the Reimbursement Agreement, voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency of SMUD, or the downgrade by any Rating Agency (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) of its long-term unenhanced rating with respect to any Bonds (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) to a level below “Baa3” (or its equivalent) in the case of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., “BBB-” (or its equivalent) in the case of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services or “BBB-” (or its equivalent) in the case of Fitch, Inc.

**Remedies under the Reimbursement Agreement.** Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default under the Reimbursement Agreement, the Bank may, but is not obligated to (i) declare all Obligations (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) to be immediately due and payable, (ii) deliver to the Depositary a “No-Issuance Notice” under the terms of the Letter of Credit stating Amount to the amount of the then outstanding Notes supported by the Letter of Credit and/or terminate the Letter of Credit Stated Amount as the then outstanding Notes are paid, (iii) issue the “Final Drawing Notice” to the Depositary, the effect of which shall be to cause the termination of the Letter of Credit to occur on the 15th day after the date of receipt thereof by the Depositary or (iv) pursue such other remedies as are available to it at law or in equity.

Upon the issuance of a Final Drawing Notice by the Bank, the Depositary is required to draw upon the Letter of Credit in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes then outstanding as the same become due.

**ALTERNATE LETTER OF CREDIT**

Pursuant to the terms of the Resolution, SMUD may elect to replace the Letter of Credit with one or more letters of credit issued by a commercial bank or financial institution (or a syndicate of such institutions acting jointly or severally), delivered to the Depositary pursuant to the Depositary Agreement and conforming to the requirements of the Resolution (the “Alternate Letter of Credit”). SMUD shall give written notice of its intention to exercise such election to the Depositary, not fewer than ten (10) days prior to the proposed date upon which an Alternate Letter of Credit is to become effective (the “Substitution Date”). No substitution of an Alternate Letter of Credit for the Letter of Credit shall occur unless all Notes outstanding on the Substitution Date are either (1) paid from the proceeds of the Notes issued on the Substitution Date or (2) paid from the proceeds of a drawing under the Letter of Credit and cancelled.

**THE DEALER**

SMUD has appointed BofA Securities, Inc. (the “Dealer”) as a dealer for SMUD in connection with the offering, issuance and sale of the Notes pursuant to a Dealer Agreement, dated February 28, 2019, as amended (the “Dealer Agreement”), between SMUD and the Dealer. SMUD agrees to pay to the Dealer a fee in an amount as set forth in the Dealer Agreement.

The Dealer Agreement may be terminated by the Dealer or SMUD at any time on written notice given no less than ten (10) business days prior to such termination date; provided, however, that upon the mutual agreement, such written notice may be given fewer than ten (10) business days prior to such termination date.

The Dealer, in its individual capacity, may in good faith buy, sell, own, hold and deal in any of the Notes, including, without limitation, any Notes offered and sold by the Dealer pursuant to the Dealer Agreement, and may join in any action which any owner of the Notes may be entitled to take with like effect as if it did not act in any capacity under such Agreement. The Dealer may sell any of the Notes in the secondary market at prices above or below par, at any time. The Dealer, however, is not obligated to purchase any Notes for its own account at any time. The Dealer, in its individual capacity, either as principal or agent, and its affiliates may also engage in or be interested in any financial or other transaction with SMUD and may act as depositary, account party, or agent for any committee or body of owners of the Notes or other obligations of SMUD as freely as if it did not act in any capacity under the Dealer Agreement.

The Dealer and its affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Under certain circumstances, the Dealer and its affiliates may have certain creditor and/or other rights against SMUD in connection with such activities. In the various course of their various business.

activities, the Dealer and its affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of SMUD (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with SMUD. The Dealer and its affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments.

The Dealer, which is serving as the dealer for the Notes, and the Bank, which is providing the Letter of Credit for the Notes, are affiliates. The activities of the Dealer and the Bank are unrelated to and independent of each other. By purchasing a Note, the purchaser thereof consents to any conflict of interest that could exist by reason of the different capacities in which the Dealer, the Bank and any other potential affiliate provides services in connection with the Notes.

The Dealer and its affiliates, including the Bank, may provide services to SMUD from time to time unrelated to the offering of the Notes.

TAX MATTERS

Subseries M-1 Notes

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, bond counsel to SMUD (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings, and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and will be exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes will not be a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations will not be excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. The amount treated as interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes and excluded from gross income will depend upon the taxpayer’s election under Internal Revenue Notice 94-84. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Subseries M-1 Notes. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in Appendix B.

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Subseries M-1 Notes. SMUD has made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these
<!-- Page 272 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)  
**Page 9**  

Representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the Subseries M-1 Notes. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken) or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the Subseries M-1 Notes may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the Subseries M-1 Notes. Accordingly, the opinion of Bond Counsel is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters.

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and will be exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of amounts treated as interest on, the Subseries M-1 Notes may otherwise affect a beneficial owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. The nature and extent of these other tax consequences will depend upon the particular tax status of the beneficial owner or the beneficial owner’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may cause interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes to be subject, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent beneficial owners from realizing the full value or benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals or clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the Subseries M-1 Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Subseries M-1 Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, and regarding the impact of future legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the Subseries M-1 Notes for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of SMUD, or about the effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. SMUD has covenanted, however, to comply with the requirements of the Code.

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the Subseries M-1 Notes ends with the delivery of its opinion, and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend SMUD or the beneficial owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the Subseries M-1 Notes in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, beneficial owners would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in connection with an audit examination of tax-exempt obligations is
<!-- Page 273 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+not+displayed)

difficult, obtaining an independent review of IRS positions with which SMUD legitimately disagrees, may not be practicable. Any action of the IRS, including but not limited to selection of the Subseries M-1 Notes for audit, or the course or result of such audit, or an audit of obligations presenting similar tax issues may affect the market price for, or the marketability of, the Subseries M-1 Notes, and may cause SMUD or the beneficial owners to incur significant expense.

Payments on the Subseries M-1 Notes generally will be subject to U.S. information reporting and possibly to “backup withholding.” Under Section 3406 of the Code and applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, a non-corporate beneficial owner of Subseries M-1 Notes may be subject to backup withholding with respect to “reportable payments,” which include interest paid on the Subseries M-1 Notes and the gross proceeds of a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of the Subseries M-1 Notes. The payor will be required to deduct and withhold the prescribed amounts if (i) the payee fails to furnish a U.S. taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the payor in the manner required, (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect, (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the Code or (iv) the payee fails to certify under penalty of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding under Section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Code. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a beneficial owner’s federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Certain beneficial owners (including among others, corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations) are not subject to backup withholding. The failure to comply with the backup withholding rules may result in the imposition of penalties by the IRS.

### Subseries M-2 Notes

**State of California Income Tax Considerations.** In the opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Subseries M-2 Notes is exempt from State of California personal income taxes.

**Certain United States Federal Tax Considerations.** Interest on the Subseries M-2 Notes is not excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes.

Prospective investors that are not individuals or regular C corporations who are U.S. persons purchasing the Subseries M-2 Notes for investment should consult their own tax advisors as to any tax consequences to them from the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Subseries M-2 Notes.

### RATINGS

Each rating below reflects only the view of the ratings service issuing such rating and is not a recommendation by such rating services to purchase, sell or hold the obligations to which such rating applies or as to the market price or suitability of such obligations for a particular investor. An explanation of the significance of a rating may be obtained from the ratings service issuing such rating. There is no assurance that any rating will continue for any period of time or

10
<!-- Page 274 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

that it will not be revised or withdrawn. A revision or withdrawal of a rating may have an effect on the market price of the obligation to which such rating applies.

### DTC’S BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

Each subseries of the Notes will be evidenced by a single master note (each a “Master Note” and, collectively, the “Master Notes”) registered in the name of a nominee of DTC. The Master Notes will be deposited with the Depositary as custodian for DTC. DTC will record, by appropriate entries on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the amounts payable in respect of the Notes. Payments by DTC participants to purchasers for whom a DTC participant is acting as agent in respect of Notes will be governed by the standing instructions and customary practices under which securities are held at DTC through DTC participants.

### LITIGATION

There is no litigation now pending or, to the knowledge of SMUD, threatened against SMUD which restrains or enjoins the issuance or delivery of the Notes or the use of the proceeds of the Notes or which questions or contests the validity of the Notes or the proceedings and authority under which they are to be issued, executed and delivered. To the knowledge of SMUD, neither the creation, organization, nor existence of SMUD, nor the title of the present members or other officials of SMUD to their respective offices, is being currently contested or questioned.

### CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS

The validity of the Notes and certain other legal matters are subject to the approving opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD. A complete copy of the proposed form of Bond Counsel opinion is contained in Appendix B. Bond Counsel undertakes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of this Commercial Paper Memorandum. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the Bank by Chapman and Cutler LLP.

In addition, SMUD has several other outstanding debt issues for which it has entered into agreements (the “Continuing Disclosure Agreements”) to file certain annual financial information and operating data and its audited financial statements with EMMA. The Continuing Disclosure Agreements may be terminated or amended pursuant to their respective terms without the necessity of obtaining the consent of any holders of the Notes. The Continuing Disclosure Agreements are solely for the benefit of the holders of the related debt issues and the holders of the Notes have no right to enforce the provisions of the Continuing Disclosure Agreements. However, holders and potential purchasers of the Notes may access such information through EMMA, so long as SMUD is required to make such filings.

We have acted as bond counsel to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) in connection with the authorization of the issuance of up to $250,000,000 aggregate principal amount (at any time Outstanding) of commercial paper notes by SMUD, pursuant to Resolution No. 19-02-02, adopted by SMUD on February 21, 2019, as supplemented by Resolution No. 22-02-06, adopted by SMUD on February 17, 2022, and by Resolution No. 24-02-[__], adopted by SMUD on February 15, 2024 (collectively, the “Resolution”), and designated Sacramento Municipal Utility District Commercial Paper Notes, Subseries M-1 (the “Subseries M-1 Notes”) and Subseries M-2 (the “Subseries M-2 Notes” and, together with the Subseries M-1 Notes, the “Notes”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Resolution; the Tax Certificate of SMUD, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”); the Depositary Agreement, dated February 28, 2019 (the “Depositary Agreement”), between SMUD and the Depositary; an opinion of counsel to SMUD; certificates of SMUD, the Depositary and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof before or after Notes are issued. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters. We disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures provided to us and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than SMUD. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy (as of the date hereof and as of each date of issuance from time to time of the Notes) of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinion, referred to in the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly retroactive to the date on

which the first Subseries M-1 Notes were issued. We call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Notes, the Resolution and the Tax Certificate and their enforceability may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against governmental entities such as SMUD in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the property described in or subject to the lien of the Resolution or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein of, or the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such property. Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Commercial Paper Memorandum or other offering material relating to the Notes and express no view with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1. The Resolution has been duly adopted by SMUD and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of SMUD.

2. The Notes, when duly issued from time to time in the form authorized by and otherwise in compliance with the Resolution, executed by an Authorized Officer and authenticated by the Depositary against payment therefor, will constitute the valid and binding limited obligations of SMUD.

3. Interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes, when issued in accordance with the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amount treated as interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes and excluded from gross income will depend on the taxpayer’s election under Internal Revenue Service Notice 94-84. Interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. We observe that interest on the Subseries M-1 Notes included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Interest on the Notes, when issued in accordance with the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. We observe that interest on the Subseries M-2 Notes is not excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Notes.

Faithfully yours,

President Herber then called for statements from the public regarding items not on the agenda.

Michael Garabedian, with Placer County Tomorrow, spoke about the project he called the Regional University Project, which was going to the Placer County Board of Supervisors. He stated that Placer County’s presentation on the item did not describe the environmental impacts that were problematic, and he stated that SMUD also did not present on those impacts during that meeting. He stated his concern with respect to Placer County lowering development standards through the region, despite the Placer County Conservation Plan.

Mr. Lau directed staff to meet with Mr. Garabedian to gain an understanding of the issue.

President Herber then turned to Directors’ Reports.

Director Sanborn reported on her attendance at a Grid Alternatives project in Antelope where a customer received some assistance with regard to a solar and storage system on her home. She then reported on her attendance, along with President Herber, at the California Municipal Utilities Association (CMUA) Conference and her attendance at the grand opening of the Roseville Oaks Adolescent Outpatient Behavioral Health Center in Roseville. She concluded by reporting on a meeting with a friend who owns a paint recycling company who connected with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) and SMUD staff to look into getting more electric long-haul trucks brought to Sacramento.

Director Tamayo reported on his attendance at the Nurturing Talent, Building Futures apprenticeship event hosted at the SMUD Customer Service Center. He stated he had made comments at the Lunar New Year Festival event in Elk Grove organized by the Vietnamese American Community of Sacramento and the Northern California Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. He concluded by thanking SMUD staff for a tutorial he had received with regard to the use of social media.
<!-- Page 281 -->
Director Kerth reported on his attendance at the annual installation dinner for the Sacramento Area Realtors Association as well as the installation dinner for the North State Building Industry Association. He concluded by reporting on his 2x2 meeting, along with President Herber, with the Sacramento Tree Foundation.

Vice President Fishman reported that he had emceed the annual Project R.I.D.E. crab feed fundraiser and had participated in the MLK Dinner at Sac State. He concluded by speaking about SMUD’s quick response to the recent storm events and thanked staff for their work on repair of damages.

Director Rose reported on his attendance at the Napa-Solano Building Trades Annual Crab Feed, the CleanStart Long Duration Storage meeting, the Young Professionals in Energy Educational Panel at the Capitol, the Planning and Conservation League’s (PCL’s) Environmental Assembly, the Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCo) Advisory Committee meeting, and the Single Mom Strong Career Exploration event. He then reported on his speaking engagement with the Slavic Chamber Business Workshop. He concluded by apologizing to those who had lost power during the recent storm and thanked staff for their work in getting power restored as quickly as possible.

President Herber reported on her speaking engagement at the Youth Rise event at the Design Tech High School in Rancho Cordova as well as her visit to the third grade class at Martin Luther King Elementary School. She reported on her attendance at the PCL Environmental Assembly and the CMUA Workshop. She then reported on her speaking engagements at the Asian Pacific Islander Desi American (APIDA) Lunar New Year awards luncheon and concluded by reporting on her attendance at the State of Public Safety address given by Sacramento County District Attorney Thien Ho.

Paul Lau, Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, reported on the following items:

1) Storm Response. As you know, the weather topped headlines across California last week. Our region was hit by more than eight hours of sustained wind with 65+ mph wind gusts, and I
<!-- Page 282 -->
think the last time we had something similar that was like last year was what we called the Great Storm of 2008. That kind of tells you, the last time we had something like that was 16 years ago. Now, we are having it last year, and we are having it this year. This storm knocked out 200,000 of our customers, out of the 650,000. So, I could not be more thankful. Our crews jumped into action as soon as the wind died down. Our Emergency Operations Center (EOC) was activated the day before, and with some great planning, I want to give special thanks to Chief Operating Officer Frankie McDermott and his team, we dispatched crews out of Oregon and California the day before to get them here so that as soon as the storm hits and as soon as we got ready to go out, we had fully staffed crews of 80 that were going out to restore power. Another thing I wanted to give thanks about is our Customer Services team did a wonderful job in terms of as soon as we found out that a customer was not going to be restored by nightfall, they called every single one of those customers and offered assistance where we could, and we did that every night for the four nights we had customers out. Within 24 hours, we were able to restore about 90 percent of the power. I want to give special thanks – I see Katarina Miletijev, our Director of Distribution Operations and Planning, and also you have Steve Hoyt who runs our Distribution Systems Operations with all dispatchers looking at dispatching all the crews, doing all of the switching, and I think they were up for 20 hours straight on the first night they were there, so a special thanks to those two sitting back there. I could not be more proud of our folks. Again, I appreciate what Director Rose said. I want to thank the public in terms of it is always very difficult when you lose power for a couple of days, and as Vice President Fishman said, this used

1. **Climate Change Impact**: It is becoming a very rare occurrence that we have customers out for a day or two. From the January storm last year and the February storm this year, it is hoped that this is not a regular occurrence, but climate change is impacting local weather.

2. **Upgraded Credit Rating**: Moody’s Investor Service has upgraded our credit rating from Aa2 to Aa3. This is the highest rating we have ever had with Moody’s. Congratulations to everyone for keeping SMUD financially healthy through collaborative work.

3. **Black History Month & Lunar New Year**: This month, we celebrate Black History Month and Lunar New Year at SMUD. The Black Employees Resource Group hosted an event honoring African American trailblazers. The GRAIN Employee Resource Group celebrated the Year of the Wood Dragon with a dim sum feast.

4. **SMUD Cares Appreciation Lunch**: Next week, we will honor our top volunteers and donors at the annual SMUD Cares Appreciation luncheon. In 2023, 775 volunteers participated.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/1265x768.png?text=Document+Image) 

participated in 74 volunteer opportunities with SMUD Cares.  
These efforts resulted in over 2,000 volunteer hours. Also in 2023, employees pledged more than $420,000 of their personal funds to support the nonprofit organizations they are passionate about. SMUD employees are the best at giving back to our community, but what impresses me the most is how our employees keep taking charitable giving – in dollars and volunteer hours – to new heights.

5) **Board Video.** Tonight’s video showcases our One SMUD response to restore power for our customers and community after the latest storm.

President Herber requested the Summary of Board Direction, but there were no items.

No further business appearing, President Herber adjourned the meeting in memory of community leader and former Sacramento City Councilwoman Lauren Hammond at 7:02 p.m.

# DRAFT

## Board Monitoring Report 3rd and 4th Quarters, 2023 Strategic Direction SD-6, Safety Leadership

### 1. Background

Strategic Direction SD-6, Safety Leadership states that:

Creating a safe environment for employees and the public is a core value of SMUD.

Through best practice methods and continuous improvement, SMUD will be recognized as a leader in employee safety while also assuring the safety of the public related to SMUD operations and facilities. SMUD commits to a proactive approach, including the active involvement of SMUD leadership, employees, contractors, and the community, as well as comprehensive monitoring of organizational and public safety performance.

Therefore, SMUD will continuously improve safety results related to:

a) **Workplace Safety**  
   i) Reduce SMUD’s injury severity incidents to 13 or less than by 2025, as measured by OSHA’s Days Away Restricted Time (DART), a rate that demonstrates top quartile safety performance for similar size utilities using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) work-related safety data.  
   ii) Provide timely, quality health care for injured employees that aids their recovery while maintaining positive financial performance of the workers’ compensation program.

b) **Contractor Safety**  
   i) Support contractors to reduce and eliminate potential hazards for Serious Injuries and/or Fatality (SIF) when conducting high risk work.

c) **Public Safety**  
   i) Track and report injuries to the public related to SMUD operations or facilities.  
   ii) Implement measures to protect the public from injuries related to SMUD operations or facilities.

### 2. Executive Summary

a) SMUD is in compliance with the SD-6 direction and is in alignment with SMUD’s new 5-year strategy of working toward a zero-incident culture.

**Workplace Safety**  
SMUD recorded 42 OSHA Recordables injuries in 2023. Seventeen of the 42 OSHA injuries (10 Lost Time & 7 Modified Duty cases) resulted in a 0.79 DART rate. Ergonomic injuries in the field contributed to 45% of all injuries. Knee, shoulder, and back have been identified as the most common injured body parts for the field.

**Actuarial report covers all losses as of June 30, 2023.**

| Year | No. of Claims (Medical & Indemnity) | Incident rate per 100 employees | Rates per $100 payroll |
|------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|
| 2019 | 85                                   | 3.6                             | .94                    |

This past year continued to present challenges with COVID-19. COVID-19 has not only impacted the way SMUD is getting work done but has also resulted in new and emerging legislation surrounding paid leave and workers’ compensation liabilities for COVID related injuries. Despite these challenges SMUD’s program remains strong and continues to lead when compared with similarly situated organizations. No COVID-19 claims were made in 2023.

**Contractor Safety**

SMUD continues to utilize ISN to evaluate safety records and performance for high-risk contractors. This evaluation focuses on Contractor Fatality History, OSHA Citation History, DART, and Total Recordable Incident Rates (TRIR), Insurance Experience Ratio, Safety Culture Questions, and Safety Program Review. Currently SMUD has 110 contractors in the ISN system.

This past year we substantially increased the number of site safety evaluations for high-risk contractors to validate safety performance on the jobsites. Safety completed 454 site safety visits through the 4th Quarter of 2023 and exceeded the 2023 goal of 200 evaluations. These site visits focused on SMUD contractors who work with Power Generation, Environmental Services, Line, Substation, Facilities and Vegetation Management on projects where high-risk work is performed. This work includes high voltage work, working at heights, vegetation management, confined spaces, excavations, etc. Additionally, we have fully integrated the use of the Safety Management System (SMS) for inspections, incident tracking, reporting and investigations of SMUD contractors. This allows SMUD to verify safe working practices by our contractors to reduce the potential for serious injuries or property damage. Contractor reported incidents which required an investigation to be completed, and typically will warrant additional site safety visits to verify corrective measures have been put into place to reduce further occurrences.

In addition, SMUD Procurement and Safety have partnered to enhance contract language as it relates to contractor safety requirements, Request for Proposal (RFP).

**templates for high-risk work and incorporating contractor safety as part of the onboarding process.**

**Public and Community Safety**  
SMUD tracks public and community incidents in the Safety Incident Tracking System (SITS) involving car-pole, electrical contact, dig-in incidents, and injuries to the public that are related to SMUD’s operations or facilities. For the entire year of 2023, there were 253 incidents where the public struck a SMUD asset with a vehicle, with four fatalities from such events. Seventy-two dig-ins have been reported with no injuries. Two electrical contacts with one minor injury. Public safety has partnered with local agencies to expand knowledge of the dig in and electrical safety response programs.

**3. Additional Supporting Information**  
The new SD-6 Safety Direction became effective February 2021. Our goal is to achieve the desired performance objectives by year-end 2025. This report summarizes the first half of the 2023 safety performance.

**Safety Leadership.**  
The Safety Team continues with its integration efforts to support Executive Leadership’s 5-year plan that emphasizes zero incidents and injuries and a focus on a zero-incident safety culture. SMUD’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Paul Lau, re-emphasized the need to improve safety at SMUD with a greater focus on improving our “Safety for Life” culture, reducing the risk of serious injuries and fatalities, implementing a safety management system (SMS), and improving the analysis of injury and incident trends. These goals and strategies are outlined in SMUD’s Safety Road Map and Enterprise Strategy, which was revised in 2023.

**Safety Management System (SMS).**  
During 2023, Safety continued to focus on optimization of Benchmark Gensuite the new Safety Management System (SMS). The Safety team continue to enhance applications within the system to better fit SMUD needs. New processes are being automated and introduced to employees within various applications in SMS. This includes the recording of field tailboards, safety inspections, supervisor employee interactions, EMF meter loans, contractor safety audits and injuries, office, and field ergonomics, and more. Customized dashboards have been created for field tailboards and Supervisor employee interactions.

**Safety Standards Development.**  
SMUD’s safety team continues to update Health & Safety Standards, as an on-going continuous improvement process, to provide a foundation for the organization’s World Class Safety initiatives.

The SMUD’s safety team also updated the COVID-19 IIPP Appendix, due to regulatory updates from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and Cal/OSHA regulations, which were minimized the COVID-19 requirements. This ensures compliance for our Injury Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) and COVID-19 protocols. Information on the updates is continuing to be provided to all SMUD personnel in various formats, including Safety Meetings, ENN’s, on-site electronic monitors, and drop-in meetings.

**process to the Safety Management System (SMS).** Emphasis is placed on field visits for work with the highest hazard potential. SMUD’s safety team continues our efforts in visiting crews throughout SMUD, to assist with employee safety concerns, processes, procedures, and equipment. For office personnel, an emphasis is placed on observing personnel pertaining to ergonomic risk, and slip/trip/fall hazards in walking areas. During 2023, a total of 11,008 Supervisor-Employee interactions were complete that resulted in a 133% percentage observed.

**Near Miss Reporting.** Leadership continues to support and encourage near misses and positive observation/good catch reporting. The goal of this process is to identify opportunities for learning, to prevent incidents from occurring. During 2023, 180 near miss and positive observation/good catch reports were recorded in the Safety Management System (SMS).

**Safely Conducted Observations Reduce Common Hazards (SCORCH).**  
**Engagement & Trending Data**  
Throughout the second half of 2023, a total of 2217 employees were observed under the Office & Professional process. Head/Neck posture was the top safe and at-risk behavior during this time frame. Our Behavior Highlights acknowledge the good job employees showed for keeping head in neutral postures in alignment with ears over shoulders at a high percentage. Risk Reduction Reminders stressed the importance of proper monitor height settings to avoid sustained awkward postures (chin to chest and/or chin to sky) of the head/neck area. The value of micro breaks, frequent stretching, and elevated awareness towards the later part of the day or work week was also part of the conversation.

Under the Electrical Trades and CFAS-Field process, a total of 2202 field employees were observed. Behavior Highlights were related to the high consistency employees showed for protecting their head and neck while performing job tasks. Hard Hat and Footwear tied as the top safe behaviors. Risk Reduction Reminders focused on the at-risk behavior of Situational Awareness. Guidance was provided related to the behavioral benefits of constantly updating information pertaining to surroundings for potential moving and changing hazards to the work area (e.g., stray dogs, agitated people, unlawful activity). Positively promoted how preparing for the unexpected aids in making informed decisions to successfully address events, should they occur.

**SCORCH Safety for Life promotions included the following:**
- After attending Dekra’s 2023 Safety in Action Conference in April, Committee members held a two-day (In-person/virtual) SCORCH Mini Conference to share best practice. Presentations were provided to all employees highlighting personal ownership and awareness for working safely. Topic shares ranged from Accountability for Yourself & Others, Stuff Happens and Fending off Fatigue. Positive feedback related to the relevancy of topics was received from employees and leadership in attendance.
- Digital Campaigns - Highlighting the ease and efficiency in which observations can be completed via the Safety Management System “7 Minutes for Safety” continued.
- SCORCH successfully expanded its behavior influencing ability through the promotion of two photo contest events. It was a fun way for employees to include family members as well as themselves while showcasing awareness for demonstrating safe behaviors at home and at play. SMUD employees are engaged in a wide variety of activities and hobbies, with the

4. Challenges

COVID-19. The safety of our employees is of utmost importance, so we continue to monitor SMUD COVID-19 cases and manage prevention efforts. In 2023 SMUD Safety, People, Services, & Strategies, and the Communications updated the COVID-19 guidance to meet regulatory changes within the Cal-OSHA Emergency Temporary Standard for facial coverings, testing programs, quarantine, and isolation guidelines to protect employees, contractors, and the public. SMUD continues to provide employees with COVID-19 antigen testing at our EC-OC Med Services clinic. Our third-party vendor Axiom Medical continues to handle employee contact tracing and this process has been working well. In order to improve our employee experience, the Safety dept. led the roll out of a new mobile app that allows employees to log positives cases and receive guidance at any time. During Q3/Q4 2023, SMUD has received notifications of 151 COVID positive cases from staff. As required both contact tracing and notification of potential exposures have occurred with all personnel impacted.

Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs). The SMUD Safety Team continues to partner with business units to reduce all WMSD’s. Ergonomic evaluations are conducted in the office, field, and virtually to meet the needs of the workforce. From July through December the Ergonomics Team conducted 186 ergonomic evaluations that were requested through Concern Reporting for a total of 369 for the year. Data collection enhancements to the Ergonomic Evaluator application went live in the 3rd quarter and will provide insight on ergo trends across SMUD. The Ergonomic Initial and Refresher Training for office employees was updated to reflect the new hybrid workforce. In addition, Safety continues to partner with SCORCH to utilize data to reduce potential soft tissue injuries.

Injury Prevention Outpost (IPO) program also known as Field Ergo program continues to show improve with field forces. After an initial group training during the monthly safety meetings for the various work groups to share the program details, our ergonomic experts continue to visit job sites and provide the field crew(s) with specific or personal, one-on-one assistance, covering stretching techniques; providing ergo support tools; identifying awkward postures, excessive/forceful exertions, and repetitive motions. This program originally started within Line Division and has been also requested by operational areas.

5. Recommendation

SMUD is committed to becoming a recognized leader in safety. Both SMUD’s leadership team and employees recognize that to achieve success we must integrate safety into all that we do. It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-6.

![6. Appendices - Business Segment Safety Program Improvement Initiatives](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=6.+Appendices+-+Business+Segment+Safety+Program+Improvement+Initiatives)

**Energy Delivery and Operations.** The SMUD’s safety team started a “World Class Safety” program in 2023, utilizing the Energy Delivery & Operation Strategic Plan’s Key Objectives, as the messaging, to “drive a culture of safety in pursuit of zero accidents.” Utilizing the 2023 Safety and Reliability tactics, the Safety Team worked with the smaller field-based work groups (i.e., Meter Shop, Veg Management, Telecom, Haz Mat/Network/Substations, and CMI/Survey), and other teams, such as Fleet and Warehouse, to identify foundational Leading Indicators to track progress throughout the year. These included: Monthly Vehicle Inspections (ensuring a vehicle is road-worthy), Supervisor Crew Visits and Safety Team Crew Visits (putting eyes on work and having safety conversations with field crews), SCORCH observations (providing the time and support to field crews for participation and identifying barriers) and ensuring field crew members completed their annual bundled safety training, resulting in the following: 916 Monthly Vehicle Inspections completed; 469 Crew Visits; and 110 Bulk Substation Inspections being completed. In 2024, the safety team will continue to work with business units on the foundational efforts above and continue to build a World Class Safety Program. The original foundational efforts were chosen, as they reflected employee accountability and safe behaviors in which to improve on. In 2024, the safety team added activities focusing on the employee and the Supervisor working together on safety improvements and collaboration. For example, Safety Risk Assessment (SRAs) usage will be added; Supervisor and Safety Crew visits will focus on quality, not just quantity, to identify potential safety hazards, process improvements, and good catches, which will be shared during safety meetings and other communication methods. The safety team will also focus on improvements of the Lock Out/Tag Out (LOTO) Programs for each of the work groups, which requires LOTO. This will include a review of the program, ensure the proper locks are available to the employees, and the programs are being correctly adhered to.

The quarterly World Class Safety meetings with work group leadership, will continue to provide a regular cadence to review our collaborative safety efforts, seek additional opportunities and topics to focus and improve upon, and SMUD to become the leader in World Class Safety.

In continuing our collaboration with the Sacramento Power Academy, the safety team has continued to identify opportunities to improve our internal safety training and ensure continued and consistency quality. Recently, the safety team identified opportunities to include custom videos into training to enhance the end user experience. Technology continues to advance in the training spectrum and utilization of videos will provide the opportunity to include examples from Subject Matter Experts (SME’s) performing work safely, in “classroom” or safety meeting presentations as well as enhance the delivery of safety content, throughout the organization.

Joint Labor Management Safety Committees (JLMSC) continue to evolve with an “All field teams’ approach” which allows for the sharing of safety and equipment ideas and mitigation controls, programs, and procedures re-development within our organization. In addition, the JLMSC affords SMUD employees to review utility best practices by benchmarking and/or lessons learned.

![SMUD's Flame Retardant (FR) Clothing program continues to help our employees stay safe while perform high risk task. SMUD's vendor continues to deliver on a regular basis for the field forces in our EC-OC yard, which reduces our field forces from driving to and from the vendor many store locations. This continues to provide a significant cost savings (time, gas, and driver risk reduction) for SMUD. Our safety efforts helped eliminate hundreds of individual driver trips back and forth. The Field forces feedback and response continues to be positive and appreciative.](https://example.com/image1)

**Safety for Life.** SMUD's Safety and Environmental Day returned this past year after postponing for three years during the COVID-19 pandemic. The event took place at Safety Center in the Safetyville town. The highlighted events we scheduled were pedestrian safety, bicycle safety, a driving simulator as well as a CPR class. There were over 145 attendees which included SMUD employees and their families.

Sparky's Crew continues to get families involved in safety by sending postcards and quarterly newsletters to SMUD families enrolled.

We continue to place emphasis on personal shares in our Safety for Life communications. In 2023, 23 different articles were shared across SMUD. Examples of article topics include: winter driving, heart health, eyes on path, mental health and eye protection. Quarterly Safety for Life meetings have returned to in-person with the option for Teams as well as an online meeting that can be taken at the employees’ convenience.

**Zero Carbon Energy Solutions (ZCES).** Power Generation has continued to prioritize employee safety while ensuring critical work is completed. In addition to Power Generation employees continue with their Daily Dozen morning stretches for soft tissue injury reduction, the safety team is also working with them to revamp their Quarterly Safety Meetings, their Leadership Meetings; and their annual bundled safety training (with the SPA Team).

Currently, our OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Site Safety Coordinator continues to work as a liaison between the contractor and the Hydro Operations crews, to ensure the findings are being addressed and completed, as a requirement to maintain the Cal/OSHA VPP status. As a reminder: VPP is designed to recognize employers and their employees who have implemented safety and health programs which effectively prevent and control occupational hazards. These programs go beyond the minimum required Cal/OSHA regulations and provide the best feasible protection at the site. Achieving this status ensures Hydro Operations will continue with safety process improvements as the annual comprehensive safety audits are performed by the third-party contractor.

VPP establishments are considered leaders in the field of workplace safety and health. The management commitment and employee participation are key elements in achieving VPP recognition. Applications within the Safety Management System are being utilized by Hydro Operations to ensure employees have a convenient avenue to participate in safety related activities and to track improvement.

ergonomic injuries. Fleet switched to Geotab as their new fleet tracking system. To improve safe driving awareness, Fleet developed a dashboard to share metrics of assigned fleet vehicles with various business units. Fleet began electronic monthly vehicle inspections on SMS for fleet-assigned vehicles. Fleet also rolled out electronic housekeeping inspections on Inspection Tool on SMS. Fleet completed 100% of their bundled training in October. Fleet employees continue to participate in EV training courses customized to suit SMUD’s needs in preparation for the transition to an all-electrified fleet by 2030.

All business units continue to partner in a consultative collaborative development of a World Class Safety program as OneSMUD with quarterly meetings addressing leading and lagging indicators and the latest safety observation trends across the enterprise.

Driver Safety. Supervisors are conducting side-by-side ride alongs to provide coaching and safe driving skills guidance. While Safety was able to provide additional in-person classroom and behind the wheel Smith System training. Driving Rodeos continue to be in high demand and the new partnership with Safety Center turned out to be a big success. In 2023 Safety hosted Driving Rodeo events for Substation, Network, Elec. Techs., and Revenue Operations. Safety has increased the sharing of driving-safety related topics at ED&O Safety meetings this year and is working on new safe-driving messaging materials for the ECCO Yard, HQ and Fresh Pond parking areas, as well as for digital displays at each location. Additionally, a refresh of the safe driving decals on Fleet vehicles is under way. Safe driving is being emphasized in vehicle reports that are provided to directors and managers who have frequent drivers. The reports are focused on speeding as well as seatbelt violations with the potential of more driving details to be added. Driving Rodeo planning for Line Division is currently underway for 2024.

### NARRATIVE:  

**Requested Action:**  
Approve proposed revisions to Board-Staff Linkage BL-13, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Grants.  

**Summary:**  
Staff recommends revisions to Board Staff Linkage BL-13 to provide greater flexibility to submit grant applications and executed grant-related contracts. As a result of recent funding legislation, there continues to be a variety of federal and state grant opportunities available for SMUD which require applications and grant contracts. Recommendations include removal of the $3 million grant application and contract limit based on SMUD’s commitment of financial and in-kind resources. This is replaced with authority for SMUD staff to proceed with grant applications and contracts if they are consistent with other BL policies, or the project is otherwise brought to the Board for approval as a budgeted project. Certain grants provide financial assistance for a project that has already been approved as a budgeted item. If SMUD has authorized a project in which a grant would support implementation of that project, by enhancing the original project scope, or contributing funding or partner support towards the project, staff is delegated authority to select and enter into contracts with grant partners and file grant applications. Additionally, the revisions include a requirement that the CEO and GM provide advance notice to the Board of grant commitments that create material financial, reputational, or operational risk.

**SMUD BOARD POLICY**  
**Category:** Board-Staff Linkage  
**Policy No.:** BL-13  
**Title:** Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Grants  

SMUD’s participation in state and federal grants as a prime-recipient or sub-recipient provides a unique opportunity for SMUD to leverage state and federal funds to advance SMUD’s policies, conduct research and development projects, and provide benefits to the Sacramento community. SMUD’s grant participation shall further SMUD’s strategic directives, provide benefits to SMUD’s customers and the community, and shall be consistent with the following principles.

a) **Competitive Advantage:** Because grants are typically competitively awarded, SMUD will select its grant partners or participate on a grant team where the partners provide a competitive advantage in the grant selection process. Time permitting and where practical, SMUD will select qualified grant partners through a formal or informal request for qualifications.

b) **Viable Grant Partners:** SMUD shall only contract with reputable and financially viable grant partners.

c) **Local Grant Partners:** All other things being equal, in selecting grant partners SMUD will generally prefer governmental entities, not-for-profit organizations, and businesses located in the Sacramento region.

d) **Delegation of Authority to the CEO:** The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager (CEO) is delegated authority to select and enter into contracts with grant partners and file grant applications where SMUD’s commitment of financial and in-kind resources to the grant does not exceed $3 million consistent with delegations under other Board-Staff Linkage policies, or is otherwise brought to the Board for approval as a budgeted project.

e) **Reporting:** The CEO shall provide advance notice to the Board of grant commitments that create material financial, reputational, or operational risk.

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Approve the issuance of SMUD 2024 Series M Revenue Bonds and/or SMUD 2024 Series N Revenue Refunding Bonds, authorize the distribution of the Preliminary Official Statement, and authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his designee to execute documents necessary to complete the refunding transaction or transactions, including the Bond Purchase Agreement or Agreements.  

**Summary:**  
SMUD has an opportunity to refund approximately $200 million of the 2009 Series V bonds and $250 million of the 2010 Series W bonds. This is anticipated to yield net present value savings of approximately $20+ million and effectively de-risk our portfolio from government rebate uncertainties. In 2009 and 2010, SMUD issued taxable bonds, receiving semi-annual federal credits to offset higher taxable interest rates. Since 2013, the federal subsidy rebate has been impacted by sequestration, resulting in a cumulative cost to SMUD of over $6 million to date. Moreover, the federal rebate is subject to periodic renewals, elevating political risk concerning potential future sequestrations. SMUD has the opportunity to refund both taxable bond issuances, lock in saving and remove political/federal subsidy sequestration risk.  

SMUD can also refund approximately $150 million of outstanding commercial paper notes in addition to issuing some new money to fund SMUD’s capital program. This transaction will refund variable rate debt with fixed rate debt, locking in debt service at current rates to reduce interest rate risk, and make the commercial paper capacity available for future capital spending and liquidity purposes.  

**Board Policy:**  
(Number & Title)  
SD-2 Competitive Rates; SD-3 Access to Credit Markets  

**Benefits:**  
Locks in low interest rates, reduces interest rate risk and eliminates federal subsidy sequestration risk, and additionally, preserves borrowing capacity for future capital spending and liquidity needs. Estimated net present value savings of $20+ million.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
Transaction expenses are expected to be roughly $2 million, portion of which were included in the 2024 Budget. Debt service on the refunded bonds was included in the 2024 budget, and savings going forward will be included in any future budgets and provide for headroom for other spending.  

**Alternatives:**  
Forgo opportunity to capture savings.

Good Faith Estimate of Cost for the Bond Transaction  

---

**General Background Information**  

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) intends to execute a bond transaction in the Spring of 2024, subject to market conditions. There are two series of bonds associated with this transaction:

1. **Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M.** The purpose of this transaction is to fix-out $150 million of currently outstanding commercial paper to free up credit capacity. Additionally, SMUD plans to issue $100 million in further new money needs. The senior manager for this transaction is J.P. Morgan.

2. **Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2024 Series N.** The purpose of this transaction is to refund two existing series of SMUD’s bonds, the 2009 Series V and the 2010 Series W. Both of these series of bonds have been designated as Build America Bonds. Due to recent litigation, SMUD intends to utilize the Extraordinary Optional Redemption provision and call the bonds for both debt service savings as well as to eliminate further risk that the Build America Bond subsidy will be reduced through future Congressional action. The senior manager for this transaction is Bank of America.

Based on market conditions in the end of February, PFM believes the following information (see Attachment A) is a Good Faith Estimate of Cost of the Bond Transaction as required by Government Code Section 5852.1.

(Supplemental To Resolution No. 6649,  
Adopted January 7, 1971)  
**Authorizing the Issuance of One or More Series or Subseries of Electric Revenue Bonds**

WHEREAS, on January 7, 1971, the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (the “Board”) adopted its Resolution No. 6649 providing for the issuance of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District’s Electric Revenue Bonds (as supplemented and amended, herein called the “Master Resolution”);

WHEREAS, the Master Resolution provides that the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (the “District”) may issue bonds from time to time as the issuance thereof is authorized by the Board by a supplemental resolution;

WHEREAS, revenue bonds may be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Master Resolution and Article 6a of Chapter 6 of the Municipal Utility District Act (California Public Utilities Code Sections 12850 et seq.) and the Revenue Bond Law of 1941 (California Government Code Section 54300 et seq.) for the purpose of financing improvements and additions to the District’s Electric System;

WHEREAS, revenue bonds may be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Master Resolution and California Government Code Section 53580 et seq. for the purpose of refunding revenue bonds, including the District’s commercial paper notes (the “Notes”);

WHEREAS, the District has determined to issue its 2024 Bonds (as defined herein), at one or more times and in one or more series or subseries (as specified in the hereinafter defined Sales Certificates) and in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the principal amount described herein, to (i) to the extent specified in one or more of the Sales Certificates, refund certain series and maturities of the District’s Electric Revenue Bonds (to be identified in one or more of the Sales Certificates) (the “Refunded Bonds”), (ii) to the extent specified in one or more of the Sales Certificates, finance and refinance improvements and additions to the District’s outstanding Notes, (iii) pay costs of issuance (to the extent specified in the Sales Certificates), and (iv) make deposits to the Reserve Fund or a separate debt service reserve fund (as and if specified in one or more of the Sales Certificates);

<!-- Page 326 -->
WHEREAS, Section 8.03 of the Master Resolution provides that the District may amend the Master Resolution by a supplemental resolution to be effective when there shall have been filed with the District or the Trustee the written consents of the holders and registered owners of 60% of the District’s Electric Revenue Bonds then outstanding; and

WHEREAS, the District has drafted proposed amendments to the Master Resolution which are described in Section 148.01 of this Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, and the District intends to issue the 2024 Bonds with the provision that each holder of the 2024 Bonds by purchasing the 2024 Bonds is deemed to have consented to the proposed amendments, all as more fully described herein;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of Sacramento Municipal Utility District, as follows:

ARTICLE CXLVI  
2024 BONDS  
Section 146.01 Authorization and Terms of 2024 Bonds.

(a) The Board hereby authorizes the issuance of revenue bonds of the District for the purpose of (i) refunding outstanding revenue bonds of the District, and/or (ii) financing and refinancing improvements and additions to the District’s Electric System, including through the payment of all or a portion of the District’s outstanding Notes, in each case in accordance with the Master Resolution and the Sales Certificates. The authorization provided in this paragraph to issue revenue bonds shall include, in addition to the purposes mentioned above, the authorization to issue such bonds for the allocable portion of any original issue discount, underwriting discount, bond insurance premiums, costs of issuance, deposits to the Reserve Fund or a separate debt service reserve fund, and other miscellaneous costs necessary or desirable, in the judgment of the Treasurer, to be financed by such bonds.

(b) One or more series of bonds to be issued under the Master Resolution are hereby created. Said bonds shall be known as the “Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series [__],” with such letter or other identifying series or subseries designations as are specified in the Sales Certificates (herein collectively called the “2024 Bonds”). The 2024 Bonds may be sold and issued at one or more times and in one or more series or subseries (as specified in the hereinafter defined Sales Certificates) only in fully registered form. The 2024 Bonds shall be initially registered in the name of “Cede & Co.,” as nominee of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) and shall be numbered in consecutive order in such manner as is determined by the Trustee. Registered ownership of the 2024 Bonds, or any portion thereof, may not thereafter be transferred except as set forth in Section 146.08.

(c) The 2024 Bonds shall be issued in such aggregate principal amount (not to exceed $800,000,000), shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates (payable on such dates), not exceeding the maximum rate permitted by law, shall mature and become payable as to principal on such maturity dates in the amounts and subject to such mandatory sinking fund payments on such mandatory sinking fund payment dates, if any, all as set forth in one or more
<!-- Page 327 -->
![Sales Certificates](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Sales+Certificates)

Sales Certificates to be executed and delivered concurrently with the sale of the applicable series or subseries of 2024 Bonds (collectively, the “Sales Certificates”). If all or any portion of the 2024 Bonds are to bear interest at variable rates of interest, not exceeding the maximum rate permitted by law, the manner of determining such variable rates of interest shall be as set forth in the applicable Sales Certificate. In addition to the provisions required pursuant to the terms of this Resolution to be specified in the Sales Certificates, the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager of the District, any Member of the Executive Committee of the District, the Treasurer of the District, the Secretary of the District, or the Chief Financial Officer of the District or the designee of any of them (each an “Authorized Officer”), on behalf of the District, may set forth in the Sales Certificates such provisions, in a form approved by its bond counsel and the District’s counsel, as such Authorized Officer may deem necessary or desirable and consistent with the purpose of this Resolution, including provisions (i) adding additional covenants and agreements to be observed by the District, (ii) curing, correcting, amending or supplementing any ambiguous, defective or ineffective provision contained in the Resolution, or (iii) amending or supplementing any provision contained herein to the extent necessary to obtain one or more bond insurance policies, to obtain a rating on any of the 2024 Bonds, or to provide for the issuance of any of the 2024 Bonds if, in the judgment of any Authorized Officer, after consulting with its municipal advisor, bond counsel and District counsel, such insurance, rating or provision is reasonable. Any Authorized Officer, acting alone, is hereby authorized and instructed to execute and deliver the Sales Certificates and, upon execution and delivery thereof, the Sales Certificates shall be incorporated herein and in the Master Resolution by reference. The execution and delivery of the Sales Certificates shall be conclusive evidence that, where any judgment or determination of reasonableness is required to be made by the person signing said Sales Certificates, such judgment or determination has been made.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Sales Certificate shall specify (i) a true interest cost on the applicable 2024 Bonds bearing interest at fixed rates of interest in excess of 5.50%; or (ii) a maturity date for any 2024 Bond later than forty (40) years after the date dated of such 2024 Bond.

(e) Interest on the 2024 Bonds shall be calculated on the basis and be payable on the dates set forth in the Sales Certificates, to the registered owners thereof as of the record dates specified in the Sales Certificates.

(f) Pursuant to Section 5.04 of the Master Resolution, the Sales Certificates shall specify whether the 2024 Bonds or any series or subseries thereof are to be secured by (A) the Reserve Fund, (B) a separate debt service reserve fund, or (C) neither (A) nor (B). If the Sales Certificates provide that the 2024 Bonds or any series or subseries thereof are to be secured by a separate debt service reserve fund, such Sales Certificates may provide for the creation of such funds or accounts in furtherance thereof as may be deemed appropriate in the Treasurer’s discretion, and such funds or accounts shall be held in trust by the District or the Trustee, as specified in the Sales Certificates, solely for the benefit of the Holders of the 2024 Bonds or applicable series or subseries thereof, and is hereby pledged solely to the payment of the 2024 Bonds or applicable series or subseries thereof, subject to the application thereof for the purposes set forth in the Sales Certificates. If a separate debt service reserve fund is so created, the Sales Certificates may further specify such other terms and provision relating thereto, as in the Treasurer’s discretion are appropriate, including, without implied limitation, the minimum.

balance required to be maintained on deposit therein, the purposes for which moneys on deposit therein may or shall be applied, the terms on which any deficiencies therein are to be replenished, additional limitations concerning investment of moneys therein and the valuation thereof, and provisions concerning the deposit of credit instruments in lieu of each therein.

(g) The Sales Certificates shall designate the series, amounts and maturity or sinking fund payment dates of the Refunded Bonds.

**Section 146.02 Redemption of 2024 Bonds.** The 2024 Bonds or any series or subseries thereof shall be subject to redemption on the terms set forth below and in the Sales Certificates (which may specify that some or all of the 2024 Bonds will not be subject to redemption).

(a) **Notice of Redemption.** If any of the 2024 Bonds are subject to redemption, then in addition to the notice of redemption required to be given pursuant to Article IV of the Master Resolution, the Trustee shall mail, by first class mail, postage prepaid, notice of redemption of any 2024 Bond to the Securities Depositories. Failure of the Trustee to give notice of redemption to any Securities Depository, or any defect therein, however, shall not affect the sufficiency of the proceedings of redemption with respect to any 2024 Bond. For purposes of this paragraph, the following term shall have the following meaning:

“**Securities Depositories**” means DTC, 55 Water Street, 50th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10041-0099 Attn. Call Notification Department, Fax (212) 855-7232; or, in accordance with the current guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to such other address and/or such other securities depositories as the District may designate to the Trustee in writing.

Notwithstanding any contrary provision of Article IV of the Master Resolution or this Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, (1) publication of any notice of redemption shall not be required with respect to the 2024 Bonds, so long as such 2024 Bonds are in full book-entry form, (2) any notice of redemption of the 2024 Bonds shall be mailed not less than twenty (20) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the redemption date, and (3) any notice of optional redemption of 2024 Bonds may be made conditional on the receipt of money or any other condition.

(b) **Redemption Otherwise Subject to Article IV.** Except as in this Section and in the Sales Certificates otherwise provided, the redemption of 2024 Bonds shall be subject to the provisions of Article IV of the Master Resolution.

**Section 146.03 Deposits to Interest Fund and Principal Account.** Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Resolution, the Treasurer, out of Net Revenues received by the District, shall set aside in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, such amounts as may be required so that an amount equal to the amount of principal and/or interest becoming due and payable on the 2024 Bonds on each interest payment date and principal payment date is on deposit in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account.

Section 146.04 2024 Sinking Fund.

(a) An account is hereby established within the Sinking Fund created by Section 5.02 of the Master Resolution to be designated the “2024 Sinking Fund.” On or before each minimum sinking fund payment date for any 2024 Bonds set forth in the Sales Certificates, the Treasurer shall deposit in the 2024 Sinking Fund, out of Net Revenues received by the District, such amounts as may be required to cause the balance therein to be equal to the amount of the minimum sinking fund payment due and payable on the 2024 Bonds on such minimum sinking fund payment date as set forth in the Sales Certificates.

(b) The District shall apply all such minimum sinking fund payments, as rapidly as practicable, to the purchase of 2024 Bonds at public or private sale, as and when and at such prices (including brokerage and other expenses, but excluding accrued interest, which is payable from the Interest Fund) as the District may in its discretion determine.

(c) If on the first day of the month preceding the month in which a minimum sinking fund payment date occurs, as set forth in the Sales Certificates, the moneys in the 2024 Sinking Fund equal or exceed $25,000, such moneys shall be applied by the District to the redemption on such minimum sinking fund payment date of as many 2024 Bonds as such moneys in the 2024 Sinking Fund shall suffice to redeem at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof (except that accrued interest on such 2024 Bonds so called for redemption shall be paid from the Interest Fund). All 2024 Bonds purchased or redeemed under the provisions of this Section shall be delivered to, and canceled by, the Trustee and shall not be reissued.

(d) No application of any moneys to the retirement of 2024 Bonds shall operate to impair or affect the obligation of the District to make minimum sinking fund payments for 2024 Bonds in the amounts and at the times provided in this Section; however, the District shall not be deemed to be in default with respect to any 2024 Bonds minimum sinking fund payment for any minimum sinking fund payment date if at all times prior to such minimum sinking fund payment date the District shall have fixed rates and charges as required by Section 6.08 of the Master Resolution, and if at such minimum sinking fund payment date the aggregate principal amount of all 2024 Bonds theretofore purchased or redeemed through the operation of the 2024 Sinking Fund or otherwise (together with any moneys then in the 2024 Sinking Fund) equals or exceeds the aggregate amount of minimum sinking fund payments for 2024 Bonds then and theretofore required to be made pursuant to this Section.

rates, redemption provisions and other terms of the 2024 Bonds shall be inserted therein in conformity with the Sales Certificates.

Section 146.06 Issuance of 2024 Bonds.

(a) At any time after the adoption of this Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution and the execution and delivery of the applicable Sales Certificate, the District may execute and deliver 2024 Bonds in the aggregate principal amount set forth in the applicable Sales Certificate, but not to exceed the aggregate principal amount described in Section 146.01(c).

depository”); provided that any successor of DTC or substitute depository shall be qualified under any applicable laws to provide the service proposed to be provided by it;

(ii) To any substitute depository not objected to by the Trustee, upon (1) the resignation of DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository or (2) a determination by the District that DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) is no longer able to carry out its functions as depository; provided that any such substitute depository shall be qualified under any applicable laws to provide the services proposed to be provided by it; or

(iii) To any person as provided below, upon (1) the resignation of DTC or its successor (or substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository; provided that no substitute depository which is not objected to by the Trustee can be obtained or (2) a determination by the District that it is in the best interests of the District to remove DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository.

(b) In the case of any transfer pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) of Section 140.08(a) hereof, upon receipt of all outstanding 2024 Bonds by the Trustee, together with a Certificate of the District to the Trustee, a single new 2024 Bond shall be executed and delivered for each maturity of each series of 2024 Bonds then outstanding registered in the name of such successor or such substitute depository, or their nominees, as the case may be, all as specified in such Certificate of the District. In the case of any transfer pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 146.08(a) hereof, upon receipt of all outstanding 2024 Bonds by the Trustee together with a Certificate of the District to the Trustee, new 2024 Bonds shall be executed, authenticated and delivered in such denominations and registered in the names of such persons as are requested in such a Certificate of the District, subject to the limitations of Section 146.08(a) hereof, provided the Trustee shall not be required to deliver such new 2024 Bonds within a period less than 60 days from the date of receipt of such a Certificate of the District. Subsequent to any transfer pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 146.08(a) hereof, the 2024 Bonds shall be transferred as provided in Article II of the Master Resolution.

(c) In the case of partial redemption or refunding of the 2024 Bonds of a series evidencing all or a portion of the principal maturing in a particular year, DTC shall make an appropriate notation on such 2024 Bonds indicating the date and amounts of such reduction in principal. The Trustee shall incur no liability for the failure or any error by DTC in making such notation and the records of the Trustee shall be determinative of the outstanding principal amount of 2024 Bonds.

(d) The District and the Trustee shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any 2024 Bond is registered as the Bondholder thereof for all purposes of the Master Resolution and any applicable laws, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary received by the Trustee or the District; and the District and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for transmitting payments to, communicating with, notifying, or otherwise dealing with, any beneficial owners of the 2024 Bonds. Neither the District nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or obligations, legal or otherwise, to the beneficial owners or to any other party

including DTC or its successor (or substitute depository or its successor), except for the holder of any 2024 Bond.

(e) So long as the outstanding 2024 Bonds are registered in the name of Cede & Co. or its registered assigns, the District and the Trustee (to the extent funds are provided to it by the District) shall cooperate with Cede & Co., as sole registered Bondholder, and its registered assigns, in effecting payment of the principal of and redemption premium, if any, and interest on the 2024 Bonds by arranging for payment in such manner that funds for such payments are properly identified and are made immediately available on the date they are due.

Section 146.09 Tax Covenants.

(a) The District shall at all times do and perform all acts and things permitted by law which are necessary or desirable in order to assure that interest paid on the 2024 Bonds (or any of them) will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and shall take no action that would result in such interest not being excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the District agrees to comply with the provisions of each Tax Certificate of the District, dated the date of issuance of the applicable 2024 Bonds, as amended from time to time in accordance with its terms (collectively, the “Tax Certificate”). This covenant shall survive payment in full or defeasance of the 2024 Bonds.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the District agrees that there shall be paid from time to time all amounts required to be rebated to the United States of America pursuant to Section 148(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and any temporary, proposed or final United States Treasury Regulations as may be applicable to the 2024 Bonds from time to time (the “Rebate Requirement”). The District specifically covenants to pay or cause to be paid the Rebate Requirement as provided in the Tax Certificate to the United States of America from any Net Revenues lawfully available to the District. This covenant shall survive payment in full or defeasance of the 2024 Bonds. Capitalized terms in this Section not otherwise defined in the Master Resolution or this Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Tax Certificate.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section, if the District shall obtain an opinion of counsel of recognized national standing in the field of obligations the interest on which is excluded from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation to the effect that any specified action required under this Section is no longer required, or to the effect that some different action is required, to maintain the exclusion from gross income of the interest on the 2024 Bonds under Section 103 of the Code, the District may rely conclusively on such opinion in complying with the provisions hereof, and the agreements and covenants hereunder shall be deemed to be modified to that extent without the necessity of an amendment of the Master Resolution or this Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution or the consent at any time of the Bondholders.

(d) This Section 146.09 shall be inapplicable to the 2024 Bonds, if any, issued bearing interest included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, as set forth in the applicable Sales Certificate.

Reference is hereby made to the Resolution and the Act for a description of the terms on which the Bonds are issued and to be issued, the provisions with regard to the nature and extent of the Revenues, as that term is defined in the Resolution, and the rights of the registered owners of the Bonds; and all the terms of the Resolution and the Act are hereby incorporated herein and constitute a contract between the District and the registered owner from time to time of this Bond, and to all the provisions thereof the registered owner of this Bond, by its acceptance hereof, consents and agrees.

then to be performed and all conditions then to be satisfied by the District in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Resolution and the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement.

If any of the conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Contract of Purchase with respect to the Bonds shall not have been satisfied when and as required herein, all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder with respect to the Bonds may be terminated by the Underwriters at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by written notice to the District.

4. Offering. The obligations of the District to sell and to deliver the Bonds on the Closing Date to the Underwriters shall be subject to the following conditions:

(a) The entire [$PAR] aggregate principal amount of the Bonds shall be purchased, accepted and paid for by the Underwriters on the Closing Date; and

(b) The District shall receive an Issue Price Certificate of the Senior Underwriter substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F with respect to the Bonds.

5. Issue Price of the Bonds. The Senior Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, agrees to assist the District in establishing the issue price of the Bonds and shall execute and deliver to the District at Closing an “issue price” or similar certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F, together with the supporting pricing wires or equivalent communications, with modifications to such certificate as may be deemed appropriate or necessary, in the reasonable judgment of the Senior Underwriter, the District and Bond Counsel, to accurately reflect, as applicable, the sales price or prices or the initial offering price or prices to the public of the Bonds.

(b) [Except for the maturities set forth in Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto,] the District will treat the first price at which 10% of each maturity of the Bonds (the “10% test”) is sold to the public as the issue price of that maturity; if different interest rates apply within a maturity, each separate CUSIP number within that maturity will be subject to the 10% test.

(c) [The Senior Underwriter confirms that the Underwriters have offered the Bonds to the public on or before the date of this Contract of Purchase at the offering price or prices (the “initial offering price”), or at the corresponding yield or yields, set forth in Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto. Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto sets forth, as of the date of this Contract of Purchase, the maturities, if any, of the Bonds for which the 10% test has not been satisfied and for which the District and the Senior Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, agree that the restrictions set forth in the next sentence shall apply, which will allow the District to treat the initial offering price to the public of each such maturity as of the sale date as the issue price of that maturity (the “hold-the-offering-price rule”). So long as the hold-the-offering-price rule remains applicable to any maturity of the Bonds, the Senior Underwriter will neither offer nor sell unsold Bonds of that maturity to any person at a price that is higher than the initial offering price to the public during the period starting on the sale date and ending on the earlier of the following:

(1) the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date; or

11  
4859-9712-9641.3
<!-- Page 360 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image) 

(2) the date on which the Underwriters have sold at least 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public.

The Senior Underwriter shall promptly advise the District or the District’s municipal advisor when the Underwriters have sold 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public, if that occurs prior to the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date.

The District acknowledges that, in making the representation set forth in this subsection, the Senior Underwriter will rely on (i) the agreement of each Underwriter to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in an agreement among underwriters and the related pricing wires, (ii) in the event a selling group has been created in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each dealer who is a member of the selling group to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in a selling group agreement and the related pricing wires, and (iii) in the event that an Underwriter is a party to a retail distribution agreement that was employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each broker-dealer that is a party to such agreement to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in the retail distribution agreement and the related pricing wires. The District further acknowledges that each Underwriter shall be solely liable for its failure to comply with its agreement regarding the hold-the-offering price rule and that no Underwriter shall be liable for the failure of any other Underwriter, or of any dealer who is a member of a selling group, or of any broker-dealer that is a party to a retail distribution agreement to comply with its agreement regarding the hold-the-offering-price rule as applicable to the Bonds.

(d) [The Senior Underwriter confirms that:

(1) any agreement among underwriters, any selling group agreement and each retail distribution agreement (to which the Senior Underwriter is a party) relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each Underwriter, each dealer who is a member of the selling group, and each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement, as applicable, to (A)(i) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the Senior Underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public and (ii) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, in each case if and for so long as directed by the Senior Underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires, (B) promptly notify the Senior Underwriter of any sales of the Bonds that, to its knowledge, are made to a purchaser who is a related party to an underwriter participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (each such term being used as defined below) and (C) acknowledge that, unless otherwise advised by the Senior Underwriter, dealer or broker-dealer, the Senior Underwriter shall assume that each order submitted by the Underwriter, dealer or broker-dealer is a sale to the public; and

12
4859-9712-9641.3
<!-- Page 361 -->
(2) any agreement among underwriters relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each Underwriter that is a party to a retail distribution agreement to be employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public to require each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement to (A) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the Senior Underwriter or the Underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public and (B) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, in each case if and for so long as directed by the Senior Underwriter or the Underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires.]

(e) The Underwriters acknowledge that sales of any Bonds to any person that is a related party to an Underwriter shall not constitute sales to the public for purposes of this section. Further, for purposes of this section:

(1) “public” means any person other than an underwriter or a related party,

(2) “underwriter” means (A) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the District (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public and (B) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a related party described in clause (A) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public),

(3) a purchaser of any of the Bonds is a “related party” to an underwriter if the underwriter and the purchaser are subject, directly or indirectly, to (i) more than 50% common ownership of the voting power or the total value of their stock, if both entities are corporations (including direct ownership by one corporation of another), (ii) more than 50% common ownership of their capital interests or profits interests, if both entities are partnerships (including direct ownership by one partnership of another), or (iii) more than 50% common ownership of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation or the capital interests or profit interests of the partnership, as applicable, if one entity is a corporation and the other entity is a partnership (including direct ownership of the applicable stock or interests by one entity of the other), and

(4) “sale date” means the date of execution of this Contract of Purchase by all parties.

6. Termination. The Underwriters shall have the right to terminate their obligations under this Contract of Purchase to purchase, accept delivery of and to pay for the Bonds, if,
<!-- Page 362 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
(a) between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the market price or marketability, or the ability of the Underwriters to enforce contracts for the sale, at the initial offering prices set forth in the Official Statement, of the Bonds have been materially adversely affected, in the judgment of the Underwriters, (evidenced by a written notice to the District terminating the obligation of the Underwriters to accept delivery of and pay for the Bonds), by reason of any of the following:

(1) (x) any legislation which is (A) enacted by Congress, (B) favorably reported for passage to either House of the Congress of the United States by any Committee of such House to which such legislation has been referred for consideration, or (C) recommended to the Congress for passage by the President of the United States or the Treasury Department, but only, however, if the occurrence of any of the foregoing events is generally accepted by the municipal bond market as potentially affecting the federal tax status of the District, its property or income or the interest on its bonds or notes (including the Bonds), (y) any decision rendered by a court established under Article III of the Constitution of the United States, or (z) a final order, ruling, regulation or official statement issued or made by or on behalf of the Treasury Department of the United States or the Internal Revenue Service with the purpose or effect, directly or indirectly, of imposing federal income taxation upon such interest as would be received by the holders of the Bonds, or upon such revenues or other income of the general character expected to be received by the District; provided, however, that the enactment of legislation which only diminishes the value of, as opposed to eliminating the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes will not give the Underwriters the right to terminate their obligations hereunder;

(2) Legislation enacted (or resolution passed) by the Congress or a final order, ruling, regulation or official statement is issued or made by or on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other governmental agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter, to the effect that obligations of the general character of the Bonds are not exempt from registration under other requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or are not exempt from qualification under, or other requirements of, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or that the issuance, offering or sale of the Bonds or obligations of the general character of the Bonds, including any or all underlying arrangements, as contemplated hereby or by the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement, otherwise is or would be in violation of the federal securities laws as amended and then in effect;

(3) Any new material outbreak or escalation of hostilities having a material effect on the financial markets of the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence of any other local, national or international calamity, crisis or event relating to the effective operation of the government or of the financial community in the United States or an escalation thereof, including, without limitation, a downgrade of the sovereign debt rating of the United States by any major credit rating agency or payment default on United States Treasury obligations;  
14  
4859-9712-9641.3  
<!-- Page 363 -->
(4) the declaration of a general banking moratorium by federal, New York or California authorities, or the general suspension of trading on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange, or any material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or payment services or clearing services;

(5) the imposition by the New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange, or any governmental authority, of any material restrictions now in force with respect to the Bonds or obligations of the general character of the Bonds or securities generally, or the material increase of any such restrictions now in force, including those relating to the net capital requirements of the Underwriters;

(6) the adoption of any amendment to the federal or California Constitution, decision by any federal or California court, or enactment by any federal or California legislative body materially adversely affecting (i) the District or the right of the District to receive or to pledge any of the Net Revenues, or (ii) the validity or enforceability of this Contract of Purchase, the Bonds or the Resolution;

(7) the adoption of any amendment to the California Constitution, decision by any California court, or enactment by any California legislative body adversely affecting the exemption of state or local income tax upon such interest as would be received by the holders of the Bonds, or

(8) (i) a downgrading or suspension of any rating (without regard to credit enhancement) by Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch of any debt securities issued by the District, or (ii) there shall have been any official statement as to a possible downgrading (such as being placed on “credit watch” or “negative outlook” or any similar qualification) of any rating by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch of any debt securities issued by the District, including the Bonds.

(b) an event occurs, or information becomes known, which, in the judgment of the Underwriters, makes untrue in any material respect any statement or information contained in the Official Statement, or has the effect that the Official Statement contains any untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

7. Expenses.

**Selection of Bonds for Redemption.** If less than all of a maturity of the Bonds is to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed, from the Outstanding Bonds of such maturity not previously called for redemption, by lot in any manner the Trustee deems fair.

Notice also will be mailed to the registered owners of any Bonds designated for redemption, but failure to mail such notice or any defect therein with respect to any particular Bond will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Bonds. For so long as the book-entry-only system is in effect with respect to the Bonds, the Trustee will mail notice of redemption solely to DTC or its nominee or its successor. Any failure of DTC or its successor, or of a direct or indirect DTC participant, to notify a beneficial owner of a Bond of any redemption will not affect the sufficiency or validity of the redemption of any Bond. The District may instruct the Trustee to give conditional notice of optional redemption, which may be conditioned upon the receipt of moneys or any other event.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC  
[________]  
[________]  

Re: Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
$[PAR] Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Paragraph 3(d)(6) of the Contract of Purchase (the “Contract of Purchase”), dated [SALE DATE], between J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as Senior Managing Underwriter named therein (the “Senior Underwriter”), and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (the “District”) relating to the above-captioned bonds (the “Bonds”).

As counsel to the District, I have reviewed (i) Resolution No. 6649 of the District, adopted on January 7, 1971, as amended and supplemented to date, including as amended and supplemented by Resolution No. [RESO NO.], adopted on March 21, 2024 (as so amended and supplemented, the “Resolution”); (ii) the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Undertaking”), between the District and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”); (iii) the Preliminary Official Statement of the District, dated [POS DATE] (the “Preliminary Official Statement”); (iv) the Official Statement of the District, dated [SALE DATE] (the “Official Statement”); and (v) such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent I deemed necessary to provide the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. I have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to me (whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery by, and validity against, any parties other than the District. I have not undertaken to verify independently, and have assumed, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents referred to in the second paragraph hereof. I have further assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in such documents.

I call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Resolution, the Undertaking, and the Contract of Purchase may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or  

C-1

**C-2**  

affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against municipal utility districts in the State of California. I express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, choice of law, choice of forum or waiver provisions contained therein.  

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, I am of the opinion that:  

1. The District is a political subdivision of the State of California duly organized and validly existing under the Act, as amended, and has full legal right, power and authority to execute and deliver (or adopt, as the case may be), and to perform its obligations under, the Resolution, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase.  

2. The Contract of Purchase and the Undertaking have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the District, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the parties thereto other than the District, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the District, enforceable against the District in accordance with their respective terms.  

3. The District is not in breach of or default under any existing constitutional provision, applicable law or administrative regulation of the State of California or the United States or any applicable judgment or decree or any loan agreement, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument known to me after reasonable inquiry to which the District is a party or to which the District or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District, and no event has occurred and is continuing which with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default or event of default under any such instrument which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District; and the execution and delivery of the Bonds, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase and the adoption of the Resolution, and compliance with any existing constitutional provision, law, administrative regulation, judgment, decree, loan agreement, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument known to me after reasonable inquiry to which the District is a party or to which the District or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject will not, as of the date hereof, conflict with or constitute a breach of or default under any such instrument which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District, nor will any such execution, delivery, adoption or compliance result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or other security interest or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of the property or assets of the District or under the terms of any such law, regulation or instrument, except as expressly provided by the Bonds and the Resolution.  

4. The statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement which purport to describe certain provisions of the Bonds, the Undertaking, and the Resolution present a fair and accurate summary of such provisions for the purpose of use in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement.  

5. Except as described or referred to in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement, as of the date hereof, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or  
<!-- Page 372 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
investigation, at law or in equity, before or by any court, government agency, public board or body, pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened against the District affecting the corporate existence of the District or the titles of its officers to their respective offices, or affecting or seeking to prohibit, restrain or enjoin the sale, issuance or delivery of the Bonds or the collection of the Revenues (as defined in the Resolution) or the Net Revenues (as defined in the Resolution) pledged or to be pledged to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds or contesting or affecting as to the District the validity or enforceability of the Act, the Bonds, the Resolution, the Contract of Purchase or the Undertaking, or contesting the tax exempt status of interest on the Bonds, or which may result in any material adverse change relating to the District, other than routine litigation of the type which normally accompanies its operation of its generation, transmission and distribution facilities, or contesting the completeness or accuracy of the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement or any supplement or amendment thereto, or contesting the powers of the District or any authority for the issuance of the Bonds, the adoption of the Resolution, or the execution and delivery by the District of the Contract of Purchase, or the Undertaking, nor, to the best of my knowledge, is there any basis for any such action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Act or the authorization, execution, delivery or performance by the District of the Bonds, the Resolution, the Undertaking, or the Contract of Purchase.

6. Based upon my review of the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement as General Counsel to the District and without having undertaken to determine independently the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement (except as specified in the first paragraph 4 hereof), I have no reason to believe that the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement (except for information relating Cede & Co., DTC or the operation of the book-entry system, the Appendices (except Appendix A) to the Preliminary Official Statement, and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to all of which I express no view) as of its date and as of the date of the Contract of Purchase contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and the Official Statement (except for information relating Cede & Co., DTC or the operation of the book-entry system, the Appendices (except Appendix A) to the Official Statement, and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to all of which I express no view) (A) as of the date of the Official Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (B) as of the date hereof contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

For purposes of the opinions expressed herein, I have assumed that an agreement or other document is “material” to the District if it involves amounts in excess of $10,000,000 and that a matter would result in a “material adverse change” to the District if the financial consequences involved would exceed $10,000,000.

I understand that you are relying upon the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel, with respect to the validity of the Bonds and the exclusion of interest on the

C-3  
4859-9712-9641.3
<!-- Page 373 -->
Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes and the Bonds for purposes of State of California income taxation and, accordingly, render no opinion with respect thereto.

Very truly yours,

(e) Maturity means Bonds with the same credit and payment terms. Bonds with different maturity dates, or Bonds with the same maturity date but different stated interest rates, are treated as separate maturities. (f) Public means any person (including an individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation) other than an Underwriter or a Related Party (as such terms are defined below) to an Underwriter. (g) A purchaser of any of the Bonds is a Related Party to any Underwriter if the Underwriter and the purchaser are subject, directly or indirectly, to (i) at least 50% common ownership of the voting power or the total value of their stock, if both entities are corporations (including direct ownership by one corporation of another), (ii) more than 50% common ownership of their capital interests or profits interests, if both entities are partnerships (including direct ownership by one partnership of another), or (iii) more than 50% common ownership of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation or the capital interests or profit interests of the partnership, as applicable, if one entity is a corporation and the other entity is a partnership (including direct ownership of the applicable stock or interests by one entity of the other). (h) Sale Date means the first day on which there is a binding contract in writing for the sale of a Maturity of the Bonds. The Sale Date of the Bonds is [SALE DATE].

The representations set forth in this certificate are limited to factual matters only, and as it relates to the actions of the other Underwriters, such representations are made to the best of the Representative’s knowledge based on the Representative’s records. Nothing in this certificate represents the Representative’s interpretation of any laws, including specifically Sections 103 and 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. The undersigned understands that the foregoing information will be relied upon by the Issuer with respect to certain of the representations set forth in the Tax Certificate and with respect to compliance with the federal income tax rules affecting the Bonds, and by Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to the Issuer, in connection with rendering its opinion that the interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, the preparation of the Internal Revenue Service Form 8038-G, and other federal income tax advice that it may give to the Issuer from time to time relating to the Bonds.

(b) [Except for the maturities set forth in Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto,] the District will treat the first price at which 10% of each maturity of the Bonds (the “10% test”) is sold to the public as the issue price of that maturity (if different interest rates apply within a maturity, each separate CUSIP number within that maturity will be subject to the 10% test).

(c) [The Senior Underwriter confirms that the Underwriters have offered the Bonds to the public on or before the date of this Contract of Purchase at the offering price or prices (the “initial offering price”), or at the corresponding yield or yields, set forth in Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto. Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto sets forth, as of the date of this Contract of Purchase, the maturities, if any, of the Bonds for which the 10% test has not been satisfied and

11

<!-- Page 397 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

for which the District and the Senior Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, agree that the restrictions set forth in the next sentence shall apply, which will allow the District to treat the initial offering price to the public of each such maturity as of the sale date as the issue price of that maturity (the “hold-the-offering-price rule”). So long as the hold-the-offering-price rule remains applicable to any maturity of the Bonds, the Senior Underwriter will neither offer nor sell unsold Bonds of that maturity to any person at a price that is higher than the initial offering price to the public during the period starting on the sale date and ending on the earlier of the following:

(1) the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date; or

(2) the date on which the Underwriters have sold at least 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public.

The Senior Underwriter shall promptly advise the District or the District’s municipal advisor when the Underwriters have sold 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public, if that occurs prior to the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date.

The District acknowledges that, in making the representation set forth in this subsection, the Senior Underwriter will rely on (i) the agreement of each Underwriter to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in an agreement among underwriters and the related pricing wires, (ii) in the event a selling group has been created in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each dealer who is a member of the selling group to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in a selling group agreement and the related pricing wires, and (iii) in the event that an Underwriter is a party to a retail distribution agreement that was employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each broker-dealer that is a party to such agreement to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in the retail distribution agreement and the related pricing wires. The District further acknowledges that each Underwriter shall be solely liable for its failure to comply with its agreement regarding the hold the offering price rule and that no Underwriter shall be liable for the failure of any other Underwriter, or of any dealer who is a member of a selling group, or of any broker-dealer that is a party to a retail distribution agreement to comply with its agreement regarding the hold-the-offering-price rule as applicable to the Bonds.]

(d) [The Senior Underwriter confirms that:

(1) any agreement among underwriters, any selling group agreement and each retail distribution agreement (to which the Senior Underwriter is a party) relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each Underwriter, each dealer who is a member of the selling group, and each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement, as applicable, to (A)(i) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the Senior Underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public and (ii) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, in each case if and for**
<!-- Page 398 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
so long as directed by the Senior Underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires, (B) promptly notify the Senior Underwriter of any sales of the Bonds that, to its knowledge, are made to a purchaser who is a related party to an underwriter participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (each such term being used as defined below) and (C) acknowledge that, unless otherwise advised by the Underwriter, dealer or broker-dealer, the Senior Underwriter shall assume that each order submitted by the Underwriter, dealer or broker-dealer is a sale to the public; and

(2) any agreement among underwriters relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each Underwriter that is a party to a retail distribution agreement to be employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public to require each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement to (A) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the Senior Underwriter or the Underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public and (B) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, in each case if and for so long as directed by the Senior Underwriter or the Underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires.

(e) The Underwriters acknowledge that sales of any Bonds to any person that is a related party to an Underwriter shall not constitute sales to the public for purposes of this section: 

(1) “public” means any person other than an underwriter or a related party,

(2) “underwriter” means (A) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the District (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public and (B) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a person described in clause (A) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public),

(3) a purchaser of any of the Bonds is a “related party” to an underwriter if the underwriter and the purchaser are subject, directly or indirectly, to (i) more than 50% common ownership of the voting power or the total value of their stock, if both entities are corporations (including direct ownership by one corporation of another), (ii) more than 50% common ownership of their capital interests or profits interests, if both entities are partnerships (including direct ownership by one partnership of another), or (iii) more than 50% common ownership of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation or the capital interests or profit interests of the partnership, as applicable, if one entity is a corporation and the other entity is a partnership (including direct ownership of the applicable stock or interests by one entity of the other), and

<!-- Page 399 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
(4) “sale date” means the date of execution of this Contract of Purchase by all parties.

6. Termination. The Underwriters shall have the right to terminate their obligations under this Contract of Purchase to purchase, accept delivery of and to pay for the Bonds, if,

(a) between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the market price or marketability, or the ability of the Underwriters to enforce contracts for the sale, at the initial offering prices set forth in the Official Statement, of the Bonds have been materially adversely affected, in the judgment of the Underwriters, (evidenced by a written notice to the District terminating the obligation of the Underwriters to accept delivery of and pay for the Bonds), by reason of any of the following:

(1) (x) any legislation which is (A) enacted by Congress, (B) favorably reported for passage to either House of the Congress of the United States by any Committee of such House to which such legislation has been referred for consideration, or (C) recommended to the Congress for passage by the President of the United States or the Treasury Department, but only, however, if the occurrence of any of the foregoing events is generally accepted by the municipal bond market as potentially affecting the federal tax status of the District, its property or income or the interest on its bonds or notes (including the Bonds), (y) any decision rendered by a court established under Article III of the Constitution of the United States or the Tax Court of the United States, or (z) a final order, ruling, regulation or official statement issued or made by or on behalf of the Treasury Department of the United States or the Internal Revenue Service with the purpose or effect, directly or indirectly, of imposing federal income taxation upon such interest as would be received by the holders of the Bonds, or upon such revenues or other income of the general character expected to be received by the District; provided, however, that the enactment of legislation which only diminishes the value of, as opposed to eliminating the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes will not give the Underwriters the right to terminate their obligations hereunder;

(2) Legislation enacted (or resolution passed) by the Congress or a final order, ruling, regulation or official statement is issued or made by or on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other governmental agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter, to the effect that obligations of the general character of the Bonds are not exempt from registration under or other requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or are not exempt from qualification under, or other requirements of, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or that the issuance, offering or sale of the Bonds or obligations of the general character of the Bonds, including any or all underlying arrangements, as contemplated hereby or by the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement, otherwise is or would be in violation of the federal securities laws as amended and then in effect;

(3) Any new material outbreak or escalation of hostilities having a material effect on the financial markets of the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence of any other local, national or international calamity, crisis or event relating to the effective operation of the government of or the financial community in the United States or an escalation thereof, including, without limitation, a downgrade of the sovereign debt rating of the United States by any major credit rating agency or payment default on United States Treasury obligations;

(4) the declaration of a general banking moratorium by federal, New York or California authorities, or the general suspension of trading on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange, or any material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or payment services or clearing services;

(6) the adoption of any amendment to the federal or California Constitution, decision by any federal or California court, or enactment by any federal or California legislative body materially adversely affecting (i) the District or the right of the District to receive or to pledge any of the Net Revenues, or (ii) the validity or enforceability of this Contract of Purchase, the Bonds or the Resolution;

(7) the adoption of any amendment to the California Constitution, decision by any California court, or enactment by any California legislative body adversely affecting the exemption of state or local income tax upon such interest as would be received by the holders of the Bonds, or

(8) (i) a downgrading or suspension of any rating (without regard to credit enhancement) by Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch of any debt securities issued by the District, or (ii) there shall have been any official statement as to a possible downgrading (such as being placed on “credit watch” or “negative outlook” or any similar qualification) of any rating by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch of any debt securities issued by the District, including the Bonds.

(b) an event occurs, or information becomes known, which, in the judgment of the Underwriters, makes untrue in any material respect any statement or information contained in the Official Statement, or has the effect that the Official Statement contains any untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

San Francisco, CA 94104  

Re: Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
$[PAR] Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2024 Series N  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Paragraph 3(d)(6) of the Contract of Purchase (the “Contract of Purchase”), dated [SALE DATE], between BofA Securities, Inc., as Senior Managing Underwriter named therein (the “Senior Underwriter”), and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (the “District”) relating to the above-captioned bonds (the “Bonds”).

As counsel to the District, I have reviewed (i) Resolution No. 6649 of the District, adopted on January 7, 1971, as amended and supplemented to date, including as amended and supplemented by Resolution No. [RESO NO.], adopted on March 21, 2024 (as amended and supplemented, the “Resolution”); (ii) the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Undertaking”), between the District and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”); (iii) the Preliminary Official Statement of the District, dated [POS DATE] (the “Preliminary Official Statement”); (iv) the Official Statement of the District, dated [SALE DATE] (the “Official Statement”); (v) the escrow agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Escrow Agreement”), between the District and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as escrow agent (in such capacity, the “Escrow Agent”), and (vi) such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent I deemed necessary to provide the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by authorities. I have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to me (whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery by, and validity against, any parties other than the District. I have not undertaken to verify independently, and have assumed, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents referred to in the second paragraph hereof. I have further assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in such documents.

C-1  
4870-5972-9833.3
<!-- Page 408 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

I call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Resolution, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking, and the Contract of Purchase may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights, to the application of equitable principles, and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against municipal utility districts in the State of California. I express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, choice of law, choice of forum or waiver provisions contained therein.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, I am of the opinion that:

1. The District is a political subdivision of the State of California duly organized and validly existing under the Act, as amended, and has full legal right, power and authority to execute and deliver (or adopt, as the case may be), and to perform its obligations under, the Resolution, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase.

2. The Contract of Purchase, the Escrow Agreement, and the Undertaking have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the District, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the parties thereto other than the District, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the District, enforceable against the District in accordance with their respective terms.

3. The District is not in breach of or default under any existing constitutional provision, applicable law or administrative regulation of the State of California or the United States or any applicable judgment or decree or any loan agreement, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument known to me after reasonable inquiry to which the District is a party or to which the District or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District, and no event has occurred and is continuing which with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default or event of default under any such instrument which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District; and the execution and delivery of the Bonds, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase and the adoption of the Resolution, and compliance with any existing constitutional provision, law, administrative regulation, judgment, decree, loan agreement, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument known to me after reasonable inquiry to which the District is a party or to which the District or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject will not, as of the date hereof, conflict with or constitute a breach of or default under any such instrument which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District, nor will any such execution, delivery, adoption or compliance result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or other security interest or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of the property or assets of the District or under the terms of any such law, regulation or instrument, except as expressly provided by the Bonds and the Resolution.

4. The statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement which purport to describe certain provisions of the Bonds, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase are accurate in all material respects.

**C-3**

5. Except as described or referred to in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement, as of the date hereof, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at law or in equity, before or by any court, government agency, public board or body, pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened against the District affecting the corporate existence of the District or the titles of its officers to their respective offices, or affecting or seeking to prohibit, restrain or enjoin the sale, issuance or delivery of the Bonds or the collection of the Revenues (as defined in the Resolution) or the Net Revenues (as defined in the Resolution) pledged or to be pledged to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds or contesting or affecting as to the District the validity or enforceability of the Act, the Bonds, the Resolution, the Escrow Agreement, the Contract of Purchase or the Undertaking, or contesting the tax exempt status of interest on the Bonds, or which may result in any material adverse change relating to the District, other than routine litigation of the type which normally accompanies its operation of its generation, transmission and distribution facilities, or contesting the completeness or accuracy of the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement or any supplement or amendment thereto, or contesting the powers of the District or any authority for the issuance of the Bonds, the adoption of the Resolution, or the execution and delivery by the District of the Contract of Purchase, the Escrow Agreement, or the Undertaking, nor, to the best of my knowledge, is there any basis for any such action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Act or the authorization, execution, delivery or performance by the District of the Bonds, the Resolution, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking, or the Contract of Purchase.

6. Based upon my review of the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement as General Counsel to the District and without having undertaken to determine independently the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement (except as specifically set forth in paragraph 4 hereof), I have no reason to believe that the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement (except for information relating Cede & Co., DTC or the operation of the book-entry system, the Appendices (except Appendix A) to the Preliminary Official Statement, and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to all of which I express no view) as of its date and as of the date of the Contract of Purchase contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and the Official Statement (except for information relating Cede & Co., DTC or the operation of the book-entry system, the Appendices (except Appendix A) to the Official Statement, and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to all of which I express no view) (A) as of the date of the Official Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (B) as of the date hereof contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

For purposes of the opinions expressed herein, I have assumed that an agreement or other document is "material" to the District if it involves amounts in excess of $10,000,000 and
<!-- Page 410 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
that a matter would result in a “material adverse change” to the District if the financial consequences involved would exceed $10,000,000.

I understand that you are relying upon the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel, with respect to the validity of the Bonds and the exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes and the Bonds for purposes of State of California income taxation and, accordingly, render no opinion with respect thereto.

Very truly yours,

**PRELIMINARY OFFICIAL STATEMENT DATED [____], 2024**

**NEW ISSUE - FULL BOOK-ENTRY**

Ratings: See “RATINGS” herein

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD, based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and, assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series M Bonds. See “TAX MATTERS.”

**PRINCIPAL AMOUNT**  
**ELECTRIC REVENUE BONDS, 2024 SERIES M**  
**[(GREEN BONDS – CLIMATE BOND CERTIFIED)]**

Dated: Date of Delivery  
Due: [____], as shown on the inside cover

The Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M (the “2024 Series M Bonds”) will be issued pursuant to the provisions of Resolution No. 6649 of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”), as amended and supplemented, and will be payable from the Net Revenues of the Electric System of SMUD, as described herein. The 2024 Series M Bonds are being issued to (i) finance and refinance certain improvements and additions to SMUD’s Electric System, including by paying the outstanding principal amount of SMUD’s commercial paper notes at maturity, and (ii) pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds. See “PLAN OF FINANCE.”

The 2024 Series M Bonds will mature in the years and amounts as shown on the inside cover. Interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds will accrue at the rates set forth on the inside cover and be payable on [____], 2024, and semiannually thereafter on each [____] and [____].

The 2024 Series M Bonds are subject to redemption prior to maturity as described herein. See “THE 2024 SERIES M BONDS – Redemption Provisions.”

The 2024 Series M Bonds have been designated as “Green Bonds – Climate Bond Certified.” Kestrel has provided an independent external review and opinion that the 2024 Series M Bonds conform with the Climate Bonds Standard (Version 4.0), and therefore qualify for Climate Bonds designation. See “DESIGNATION OF 2024 SERIES M BONDS AS GREEN BONDS – CLIMATE BOND CERTIFIED” herein and APPENDIX G – “CLIMATE BOND VERIFIER’S REPORT” hereto for more information.

The 2024 Series M Bonds will be issued in fully registered form and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). DTC will act as securities depository (the “Securities Depository”) for the 2024 Series M Bonds. Individual purchases of interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds may be made in book-entry form only, in the principal amount of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. Purchasers of such interests will not receive certificates representing their interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds. Principal and interest are payable directly to the Securities Depository by U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, Trustee and Paying Agent. Upon receipt of payments of principal and interest, the Securities Depository will in turn remit such principal and interest to the Securities Depository’s Direct Participants (as such term is herein-defined) for subsequent distribution to the purchasers of interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds, as described herein. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.”

The principal of and interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds, together with the debt service on other Parity Bonds (as defined herein), are payable exclusively from and secured by a pledge of the Net Revenues of the Electric System of SMUD.

![Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $[________] are expected to be outstanding under the Resolution. See "PLAN OF FINANCE."](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Bonds+in+the+aggregate+principal+amount+of+%24%5B________%5D+are+expected+to+be+outstanding+under+the+Resolution.+See+%22PLAN+OF+FINANCE.%22)

Although the Resolution establishes an “Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund” (the “Reserve Fund”), the Reserve Fund does **not** secure and will not be available to pay debt service on the 2024 Series M Bonds. The Reserve Fund secures all Bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 that are currently outstanding (and not otherwise deemed to be paid and discharged under the Resolution) and may secure additional Bonds issued in the future.

U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association serves as trustee and paying agent under the Resolution (in such capacities, the “Trustee” and the “Paying Agent” respectively).

From time to time, SMUD issues Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the “Subordinate Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 were outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of the Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series M Bonds).

SMUD also issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of December 31, 2023, Notes in the principal amount of $150,000,000 were outstanding. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes (and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit) are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal, premium if any, and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series M Bonds) and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. SMUD expects to pay all $150,000,000 of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes with a portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series M Bonds. See “PLAN OF FINANCE.”

SMUD has also previously issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes pursuant to a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”). As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future. SMUD’s payment obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series M Bonds) and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

SMUD is responsible for the acquisition, generation, transmission and distribution of electric power to its service area, which includes most of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD served a population of approximately 1.5 million with a total annual retail load of approximately 10,104 million kilowatt hours (“kWh”). SMUD owns and operates an electric system which, as of December 31, 2023, included generating facilities owned and operated by SMUD with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 775 megawatts (“MW”), local gas-fired plants owned and operated by a joint powers authority and managed by SMUD.
<!-- Page 431 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 1,087 MW, over which SMUD has exclusive control of dispatch, and purchased power with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 1,590 MW and transmission and distribution facilities. SMUD’s power requirements exceed its generating capacity and thus SMUD has agreements with others (including the Local Gas-Fired Plants as defined in APPENDIX A) for the purchase of a portion of its power requirements. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Supply Resources.” Continuing development of SMUD’s business strategy in response to changing environmental and regulatory requirements has had, and is expected to continue to have, a major effect on SMUD’s power supply planning. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – BUSINESS STRATEGY.”

Pursuant to a Continuing Disclosure Agreement, dated the date of issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds (the “Continuing Disclosure Agreement”) between SMUD and the Trustee, SMUD will covenant for the benefit of the holders of the 2024 Series M Bonds and owners of beneficial interest in the 2024 Series M Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data and to provide certain notices. See “CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING” and APPENDIX F – “FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.”

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Official Statement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in APPENDIX D – “SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION – Certain Definitions” or in the Resolution.

**PLAN OF FINANCE**

**Issuance of 2024 Series M Bonds**

The proceeds of the 2024 Series M Bonds will be used to (i) finance and refinance certain improvements and additions to SMUD’s Electric System, including by paying the outstanding principal amount of SMUD’s commercial paper notes at maturity, [and (ii) pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds]. The issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds is a component of the Plan of Finance, as further described below. The issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds is not contingent upon the implementation of the other components of the Plan of Finance, and SMUD is not obligated to implement any of the components of the Plan of Finance.

**Issuance of 2024 Series N Bonds and Refunding of Refunded Bonds**

Concurrently with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds, SMUD expects to issue approximately $[_____] aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Series N Bonds to (i) refund the  
* Preliminary, subject to change.

$200,000,000 outstanding principal amount of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”), (ii) refund the $250,000,000 outstanding principal amount of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series W (the “2010 Series W Bonds” and, together with the 2009 Series V Bonds, the “Refunded Bonds”) [and (iii) pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds].

The Refunded Bonds were issued as bonds designated as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Recovery Act”). At the time the Refunded Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive cash subsidy payments from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the Refunded Bonds as required by sections 54AA and 6431 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (as such sections were added to the Code by the Recovery Act). However, as a result of the enactment of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “Budget Control Act”) and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the “Taxpayer Relief Act”) the subsidy payments for the Refunded Bonds became subject to sequestration and have been reduced to an amount less than 35% of the interest payable on the Refunded Bonds as originally required by sections 54AA and 6431 of the Code. See also APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments.”

The 2009 Series V Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption upon the occurrence of an “Extraordinary Event.” Pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions for the 2009 Series V Bonds, an “Extraordinary Event” will have occurred if SMUD determines that a material adverse change has occurred to Section 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as such Sections were added by Section 1531 of the Recovery Act, pertaining to Build America Bonds) or if the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury makes a determination that the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury with respect to such Sections or any other determination by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury, which determination is not the result of an act or omission by SMUD to satisfy the requirements to receive the 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury, pursuant to which SMUD’s 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury is reduced or eliminated.

The 2010 Series W Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption upon the occurrence of a “Tax Law Change.” Pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions for the 2010 Series W Bonds, “Tax Law Change” means legislation has been enacted by the Congress of the United States or passed by either House of the Congress, or a decision has been rendered by a court of the United States, or an order, ruling, regulation (final, temporary or proposed) or official statement has been made by or on behalf of the Treasury Department of the United States, the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental agency of appropriate jurisdiction, the effect of which, as reasonably determined by SMUD, would be to suspend, reduce or terminate the payment from the United States Treasury to SMUD with respect to the 2010 Series W Bonds, or to state or local government issuers generally with respect to obligations of the general character of the 2010 Series W Bonds, pursuant to Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code of an amount equal to 35% of the interest due thereon on each interest payment date (the “Subsidy Payments”); provided, that such suspension, reduction or termination of the Subsidy Payments is not due to a failure by the District to comply with the requirements under the Code to receive such Subsidy Payments.

The extraordinary optional redemption provisions for each series of the Refunded Bonds are described in the related Official Statement for such series of Refunded Bonds. The Official Statements for the Refunded Bonds can be found at the following links:

2010 Series W Bonds: [https://emma.msrb.org/EA393164-EA308299-EA704612.pdf](https://emma.msrb.org/EA393164-EA308299-EA704612.pdf)  

The foregoing links are provided for reference and convenience only. The Official Statements for the Refunded Bonds are not incorporated herein by reference and do not constitute part of this Official Statement.

For various reasons, including but not limited to, the enactment of the Budget Control Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act and the resulting reduction of the cash subsidy payments required to be paid by the United States Treasury to SMUD with respect to the Refunded Bonds pursuant to section 6431 of the Code, SMUD has determined that an “Extraordinary Event” has occurred with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and that a “Tax Law Change” has occurred with respect to the 2010 Series W Bonds. Therefore, SMUD expects to redeem the Refunded Bonds pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions applicable to each series of the Refunded Bonds.

[If the 2024 Series N Bonds are issued, then a portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds, [together with other available funds], will be deposited in one or more escrow funds (the “Escrow Funds”) established under one or more escrow agreements between SMUD and the Trustee. The moneys so deposited will be invested in direct obligations of the United States of America (the “Federal Securities”), the interest on and principal of which, together with other moneys held in the Escrow Funds, are expected to be in an amount sufficient to pay the interest on the Refunded Bonds due on [____] (the “Redemption Date”) and to redeem the Refunded Bonds on the Redemption Date at their respective redemption prices. [Upon deposit, all liability of SMUD with respect to the Refunded Bonds (except for the obligation of SMUD to pay the interest on and redemption price of the Refunded Bonds from moneys on deposit in the Escrow Fund) will cease. The Refunded Bonds will be entitled to payment from SMUD solely from moneys or Federal Securities on deposit in the Escrow Fund, and the Refunded Bonds will no longer be outstanding under the Resolution.] [Notwithstanding the obligations of the Escrow Funds, the Refunded Bonds will remain outstanding, and SMUD will remain liable for the payment of the principal and redemption price of and interest on the Refunded Bonds, until the Refunded Bonds are actually redeemed in full on the Redemption Date.] The Federal Securities and moneys in the Escrow Funds will not secure the 2024 Series M Bonds and will not be available to pay the principal of or interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds.]

[If the 2024 Series N Bonds are issued, then a portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds, [together with other available funds], will be used to pay the interest on the Refunded Bonds due on [____] (the “Redemption Date”) and to redeem the Refunded Bonds on the Redemption Date at their respective redemption prices.]

**[DESIGNATION OF 2024 SERIES M BONDS AS GREEN BONDS – CLIMATE BOND CERTIFIED**

The information set forth below concerning (1) the Climate Bonds Initiative (“CBI”) and the process for obtaining certification from CBI, and (2) Kestrel in its role as a verifier with respect to the certification of the 2024 Series M Bonds as Climate Bond Certified, all as more fully described below, has been extracted from materials provided by CBI and Kestrel and neither SMUD nor the underwriters undertake any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any such information. Additional information relating to CBI and the certification process can be found at www.climatebonds.net. The CBI website is included for reference only and the information contained therein is not incorporated by reference in this Official Statement. Neither SMUD nor the Underwriters make any representation regarding the applicability or suitability of the certification of the 2024 Series M Bonds as Climate Bond Certified.**
<!-- Page 434 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

In connection with the 2024 Series M Bonds and the improvements and additions to SMUD’s Electric System to be financed and refinanced with the proceeds of the 2024 Series M Bonds (the “Projects”), SMUD applied to CBI for designation of the 2024 Series M Bonds as “Climate Bond Certified.” CBI is an independent not-for-profit organization that works solely on mobilizing the bond market for climate change solutions. CBI has established a certification program that provides criteria for eligible projects to be considered a “Certified Climate Bond.” Rigorous scientific criteria ensure that financed activities are consistent with the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming target declared in the 2015 Paris Agreement which exists within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to address greenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. The CBI certification program is used globally by bond issuers, governments, investors and the financial markets to prioritize investments which genuinely contribute to addressing climate change.

The CBI standards use credible, science-based, widely supported guidelines about what should informed decisions about the environmental credentials of a bond. In order to receive the CBI certification, SMUD engaged Kestrel, a third-party CBI Approved Verifier, to provide verification to the CBI Certification Board that the 2024 Series M Bonds meet the CBI standards and relevant sector criteria. Kestrel reviewed and provided verification to CBI, and CBI certified the 2024 Series M Bonds as Climate Bonds on [____]. Kestrel will also provide a Post-Issuance Report to CBI as to whether the proceeds of the 2024 Series M Bonds have been allocated properly.

Per the International Capital Market Association (the “ICMA”), Green Bonds are any type of bond instrument where the proceeds will be exclusively applied to finance or re-finance, in part or in full, new and/or existing eligible Green Projects and which are aligned with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles. The four core components are: 1. Use of Proceeds; 2. Process for Project Evaluation and Selection; 3. Management of Proceeds; and 4. Reporting.

Kestrel has also determined that the 2024 Series M Bonds are in conformance with the four core components of the ICMA Green Bond Principles.

The terms “Climate Bond Certified” and “Green Bonds” are neither defined in nor related to the Master Indenture or the Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution. The use of such terms in this Official Statement are solely for identification purposes and are not intended to provide or imply that the owners of the 2024 Series M Bonds are entitled to any security other than as provided in the Master Resolution and the Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, as described under the heading “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS.”

The certification of the 2024 Series M Bonds as Climate Bonds by the Climate Bonds Initiative is based solely on the Climate Bond Standard and does not, and is not intended to, make any representation or give any assurance with respect to any other matter relating to the 2024 Series M Bonds or the Projects, including but not limited to this Official Statement, the transaction documents, SMUD or the management of SMUD.

The certification of the 2024 Series M Bonds as Climate Bonds by the Climate Bonds Initiative was addressed solely to SMUD and is not a recommendation to any person to purchase, hold or sell the 2024 Series M Bonds and such certification does not address the market price or suitability of the 2024 Series M Bonds for a particular investor. The certification also does not address the merits of the decision by SMUD or any third party to participate in any nominated project and does not express and should not be deemed to be an expression of an opinion as to SMUD or any aspect of the Projects (including but not limited to the financial viability of the Projects) other than with respect to conformance with CBI’s standards for Certified Climate Bonds.
<!-- Page 435 -->
In issuing or monitoring, as applicable, the certification, CBI and Kestrel have assumed and relied upon and will assume and rely upon the accuracy and completeness in all material respects of the information supplied or otherwise made available to CBI and Kestrel. CBI does not assume or accept any responsibility to any person for independently verifying (and it has not verified) such information or to undertake (and it has not undertaken) any independent evaluation of any nominated project or SMUD.

In addition, CBI does not assume any obligation to conduct (and it has not conducted) any physical inspection of any nominated project. The certification may only be used with the 2024 Series M Bonds and may not be used for any other purpose without CBI’s prior written consent.

The certification does not and is not in any way intended to address the likelihood of timely payment of interest when due on the 2024 Series M Bonds and/or the payment of principal at maturity or any other date.

The certification may be withdrawn at any time in the Climate Bonds Initiative’s sole and absolute discretion and there can be no assurance that such certification will not be withdrawn.

**Approved Verifier for Third Party Verification of Climate Bond**

SMUD has engaged Kestrel to provide a Verification on the 2024 Series M Bonds’ conformance with the Climate Bond Standard V4.0. Kestrel has determined that the projects and activities to be financed with the proceeds of the 2024 Series M Bonds satisfy the Climate Bond Standard V4.0 and the Electrical Grids and Storage Criteria (Version 1.0). Accredited as an “Approved Verifier” by the Climate Bonds Initiative, Kestrel evaluates bonds against the Climate Bonds Initiative Standards and Criteria in all sectors worldwide. Kestrel’s Climate Bond Verifier Report is attached as APPENDIX B hereto.

Kestrel’s Climate Bond Verifier’s Report reflects only the views of Kestrel. Any explanation of the significance of Kestrel’s Climate Bond Verifier’s Report may be obtained from Kestrel. Neither SMUD nor the Underwriters undertake any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of the information contained in Kestrel’s Climate Bond Verifier’s Report. SMUD will not be required to file additional information regarding the Projects with the MSRB through EMMA (as such terms are defined herein) in the future.

# THE 2024 SERIES M BONDS

The 2024 Series M Bonds will mature in the years and amounts and bear interest at the rates set forth on the inside cover page hereof. Interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds will accrue from the date of delivery of the 2024 Series M Bonds, and will be payable on [____], 2024, and semiannually thereafter on each [____] and [____] (each, an “Interest Payment Date”) to the owners thereof as of the first day of the month (whether or not such day is a Business Day) in which an Interest Payment Date occurs (each, a “Record Date”).

The 2024 Series M Bonds will be issued in fully registered form and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). DTC will act as securities depository (the “Securities Depository”) for the 2024 Series M Bonds. Individual purchases of interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds will be made in book-entry form only, in the principal amount of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. Purchasers of such interests will not receive certificates representing their interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds. Principal and interest are payable directly to the Securities Depository by the Trustee. Upon receipt of payments of principal and interest, the Securities Depository will in turn remit such principal and interest to the Securities Depository’s Direct Participants (as such term is hereinafter defined) for subsequent disbursement to the purchasers of interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.”

**Selection of Bonds for Redemption.** If less than all of a maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the 2024 Series M Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed, from the Outstanding 2024 Series M Bonds of such maturity not previously called for redemption, by lot in any manner the Trustee deems fair. For so long as the book-entry only system is in effect with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds, DTC shall select the 2024 Series M Bonds to be redeemed in accordance with the procedures of DTC.

**Notice of Redemption.** Notice of redemption for the 2024 Series M Bonds will be given by publication at least once in financial newspapers or journals, selected by the Trustee, of general circulation in San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, each such publication to be not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption, if at any time the 2024 Series M Bonds are not in book entry form. Notice also will be mailed to the registered owners of any 2024 Series M Bonds designated for redemption, but failure to mail such notice or any defect therein with respect to any particular 2024 Series M Bonds will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other 2024 Series M Bonds. For so long as the book-entry-only system is in effect with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds, the Trustee will mail notice of redemption solely to DTC or its nominee or its successor. Any failure of DTC or its successor, or of a direct or indirect DTC participant, to notify a beneficial owner of a 2024 Series M Bond of any redemption will not affect the sufficiency or validity of the redemption of any 2024 Series M Bond. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.” SMUD may instruct the Trustee to give conditional notice of optional redemption, which may be conditioned upon the receipt of moneys or any other event.

# SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

## General

The principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds, together with other Parity Bonds, are payable exclusively from, and are secured by a pledge (effected in the manner and to the extent provided in the Resolution) of, the Net Revenues of the Electric System of SMUD.

Neither the credit nor the taxing power of SMUD is pledged to the payment of the Bonds and the general fund of SMUD is not liable for the payment thereof. The owners of the Bonds cannot compel the exercise of any taxing power of SMUD or the forfeiture of any of its property. The Bonds are not a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any of SMUD’s property (including the Electric System) or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues except the Net Revenues of the Electric System to the extent of the pledge thereof contained in the Resolution.

## Consent to Amendments to the Resolution

The purchasers of the 2024 Series M Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series M Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution (the “Proposed Amendments”). Such amendments are described in **bold italic** font herein under “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Rates and Charges” and “– Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues” and in APPENDIX D – “SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION – Certain Definitions” and “– Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds.” The written consents to the Proposed Amendments of the holders and registered owners of at least 60% of the Bonds outstanding have been filed with SMUD or the Trustee, as required by the Resolution. However, while certain Bonds remain outstanding, SMUD must also obtain the written consents of certain bond insurers to implement the Proposed Amendments. SMUD expects to implement the Proposed Amendments when the written consents of such bond insurers are obtained or
<!-- Page 439 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

when the Bonds insured by such bond insurers are no longer outstanding. The final maturity date of the insured Bonds is July 1, 2024.

**Allocation of Revenues**

After making an allocation of Revenues to Maintenance and Operation Costs and to Energy Payments not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs, the Treasurer of SMUD is required (subject to the last paragraph of this section) to set aside, on an equal priority with sums set aside for all other Parity Bonds, Net Revenues as follows:

**First:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Interest Fund, in approximately equal monthly installments on or before the first day of each month, an amount equal to at least one-fifth (1/5) of the aggregate amount of interest becoming due on the Bonds on the next succeeding semiannual interest payment date, until an amount sufficient to meet said interest payment is accumulated.

**Second:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Redemption Fund, to be set aside in the Principal Account and Sinking Fund, respectively, in approximately equal monthly installments on or before the first day of each month, an amount equal to at least one-tenth (1/10) of the aggregate amount of principal becoming due on serial Bonds and the aggregate minimum sinking fund payments required to be made with respect to term Bonds during the next ensuing 12 months, until an amount sufficient to meet the principal and sinking fund requirements on all Bonds outstanding is accumulated in said accounts, respectively.

**Third:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund, such amounts as any supplemental resolution authorizing the issuance of a series of Bonds may require to build up and maintain said fund.

If interest on Bonds of a series or maturity is payable more frequently than semiannually, the Treasurer of SMUD shall set aside out of Net Revenues in the Interest Fund such amounts as may be required to pay interest on the Bonds of such series or maturity on each interest payment date at least one month prior to such interest payment date. Allocation to the Electric Revenue Bond Redemption Fund and Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund shall be made as set forth above.

All remaining Revenues, after making the foregoing allocations, will be available to SMUD for all lawful SMUD purposes.

From time to time, SMUD may deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund from such remaining Revenues such amounts as SMUD shall determine, provided that deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund from remaining Revenues in any fiscal year may be made until (but not after) the date 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. SMUD may withdraw amounts from the Rate Stabilization Fund only for inclusion in Revenues for any fiscal year, such withdrawals to be made until (but not after) 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. All interest or other earnings upon deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be withdrawn therefrom and accounted for as Revenues. No deposit of Revenues to the Rate Stabilization Fund may be made to the extent such Revenues were included in any certificate submitted in connection with the issuance of additional bonds and withdrawal of the Revenues from the Revenues employed in rendering said certificate would have caused noncompliance with the additional bond provisions or to the extent withdrawals of the Revenues for any fiscal year would have reduced the debt.
<!-- Page 440 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Page)  

service ratio for such fiscal year to or below 1.40:1.00. See APPENDIX A – “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” for a description of the balance in the Rate Stabilization Fund.

With respect to Bonds of a series issued on or after October 1, 2003 (including the 2024 Series M Bonds), notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Bonds of such series or maturity are outstanding, the supplemental resolution authorizing the issuance of such series shall require the Treasurer, out of Net Revenues received by SMUD, to set aside in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, such amounts as may be required so that an amount equal to the amount of principal and/or interest becoming due and payable on the Bonds of such series or maturity on each interest payment date and principal payment date is on deposit in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, at such time on or prior to such interest payment date or principal payment date as shall be specified in the supplemental resolution authorizing such Bonds.

**Rates and Charges**

SMUD has covenanted in the Resolution to establish and at all times maintain and collect rates and charges for the sale or use of electric energy generated, transmitted, distributed or furnished by SMUD which, together with certain items of other income permitted under the Resolution, will yield Revenues at least sufficient, with respect to the ensuing 12 months, to pay and provide for all sums required for Maintenance and Operation Costs and Energy Payments not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs and, in addition, to provide an aggregate sum equal to at least 1.20 times the total amount required for the payment of principal and interest, together with any sinking fund or reserve fund payments, on the Bonds and all Parity Bonds, in each case during such 12 months.

For purposes of the calculations of payments to be made pursuant to the Resolution, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, if a Financial Products Agreement has been entered into by SMUD with respect to any Parity Bonds, interest on such Parity Bonds shall be included in the calculation of such principal and interest by including for each fiscal year or period an amount equal to the amount of interest payable on such Parity Bonds in such fiscal year or period at the rate or rates stated in such Parity Bonds plus any Financial Product Payments payable in such fiscal year or period minus any Financial Product Receipts receivable in such fiscal year or period; provided that in no event shall any calculation made pursuant to this clause result in a number less than zero being included in the calculation of such principal and interest.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, Excluded Principal Payments shall be disregarded (but interest on the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payments relate shall be included until but not after the stated due date when principal payments on such Parity Bonds are scheduled by their terms to commence) and Assumed Principal Payments and Assumed Interest Payments shall be included; and for purposes of the above calculations of interest on Parity Bonds, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

![Financial Statements and Tax Matters](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Financial+Statements+and+Tax+Matters)

**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

SMUD’s audited, consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are included in APPENDIX B attached to this Official Statement. These financial statements have been audited by Baker Tilly US, LLP, Madison, Wisconsin (the “Auditor”), for the periods indicated and to the extent set forth in their report thereon and should be read in their entirety. SMUD has not requested nor did it obtain permission from the Auditor to include the audited, consolidated financial statements as an appendix to this Official Statement. Accordingly, the Auditor has not performed any procedures to review the financial condition or operations of SMUD subsequent to the date of its report included therein, nor has it reviewed any information contained in this Official Statement.

**TAX MATTERS**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series M Bonds. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in APPENDIX E hereto.

To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of such 2024 Series M Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the term of such 2024 Series M Bonds), the difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of which, to the extent properly allocable to each Beneficial Owner thereof, is treated as interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and exempt from State of California personal income taxes. For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is the first price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is sold to the public (excluding bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds accrues daily over the term to maturity of such 2024 Series M Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original issue discount is added to the adjusted basis of such 2024 Series M Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon trade or business disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment at maturity) of such 2024 Series M Bonds. Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series M Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of 2024 Series M Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of Beneficial Owners who do not purchase such 2024 Series M Bonds in the original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such 2024 Series M Bonds is sold to the public.

2024 Series M Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than their principal amount payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier call date) (“Premium Bonds”) will be treated as having amortizable bond premium. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the case of bonds, like the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is.

**Page 18**

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the 2024 Series M Bonds. SMUD has made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken), or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the 2024 Series M Bonds. Accordingly, the opinion of Bond Counsel is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters.

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of amounts treated as interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds may otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. The nature and extent of these tax consequences depend upon the particular status of the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial Owner’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may cause interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent Beneficial Owners from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals or clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the 2024 Series M Bonds. Prospective purchasers of the 2024 Series M Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the 2024 Series M Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of SMUD, or about the effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. SMUD has covenanted, however, to comply with the requirements of the Code.

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds ends with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend SMUD or the Beneficial Owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the 2024 Series M Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, Beneficial Owners would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in

**CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING**  
Pursuant to the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, SMUD will covenant for the benefit of the holders and the “Beneficial Owners” (as defined in the Continuing Disclosure Agreement) of the 2024 Series M Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data relating to SMUD by not later than 180 days after the end of each SMUD’s fiscal years (presently, each December 31), commencing with the report for the year ending December 31, 2024 (the “Annual Report”), and to provide notices of the occurrence of certain listed events with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds. The Annual Report will be filed by or on behalf of SMUD with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”) through its Electronic Municipal Market Access system (“EMMA”) and any notices of such listed events will be filed by or on behalf of SMUD with the MSRB through EMMA. The specific nature of the information to be contained in the Annual Report and the notices of listed events are set forth in the form of the Continuing Disclosure Agreement which is included in its entirety in APPENDIX F hereto. SMUD’s covenant will be made in order to assist the Underwriters in complying with Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12.  

**[UPDATE/CONFIRM]** [In a limited number of circumstances, certain of the annual reports, audited financial statements or listed event filings required to be made by SMUD during the last five years under its continuing disclosure undertakings were not connected to all the CUSIP numbers of the bonds subject to the continuing disclosure undertakings. In addition, SMUD entered into two subordinated forward starting interest rate swaps in December 2019 and filed a notice of the interest rate swaps with the MSRB through EMMA in April 2020. A notice of rating upgrade on October 6, 2020, by Moody’s Investors Service of the Northern California Gas Authority No. 1 Gas Project Revenue Bonds, Series 2007B, was also not filed until October 28, 2020.]

# RATINGS

Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) have assigned ratings of “[AA (stable outlook)]” and “[Aa2 (stable outlook)]”, respectively, to the 2024 Series M Bonds. Such ratings reflect only the views of such organizations and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the 2024 Series M Bonds. Explanations of the significance of such ratings may be obtained only from the respective rating agencies. SMUD has furnished to Fitch and Moody’s certain information and materials concerning the 2024 Series M Bonds and itself. Generally, a rating agency bases its rating on the information and materials furnished to it and on investigations, studies and assumptions of its own. There is no assurance that such ratings will continue for any given period or that they will not be revised downward, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the respective rating agencies, if in the judgment of such rating agency, circumstances so warrant. SMUD has not, other than as described under “CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING” above, and the Underwriters have not undertaken any responsibility either to bring to the attention of the holders or beneficial owners of the 2024 Series M Bonds any proposed revision, suspension or withdrawal of any rating on the 2024 Series M Bonds or to oppose any such proposed revision, suspension or withdrawal. Any such downward revision, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the 2024 Series M Bonds.

# INTRODUCTION

## General

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) owns and operates an electric system that has provided retail electric service since 1946. SMUD’s current service area is approximately 900 square miles, and includes the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. See “THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM – The Service Area.”

## Independent Governance

SMUD is an independently run community-owned organization. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government.

SMUD is governed by a Board of Directors (the “Board”), which consists of seven directors elected by ward for staggered four-year terms. The Board determines policy and appoints the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, who is responsible for SMUD’s overall management and day-to-day operations. The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager is responsible for the hiring and removal of all employees, other than the Chief Legal and Government Affairs Officer and General Counsel, the Internal Auditor and the Special Assistant to the Board, who are hired and may be removed only by the Board. The employment status of nearly all SMUD employees is governed by a civil service system administered by the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager.

The Board elects its President and Vice President annually to take office in January. The current members of the Board are as follows:

| Name                     | Occupation                                               | Ward  | Term Expires     |

SMUD’s senior management consists of the following executives:

As CEO & GM, he leads the sixth largest community-owned electric utility in the nation, serving a population of approximately 1.5 million residents and managing a $2.1 billion budget. Mr. Lau previously served as SMUD’s Chief Grid Strategy & Operations Officer and has held several other executive leadership positions during his 42-year career at SMUD.

of Northern California (“BANC”). A registered professional electrical engineer in the State of California (the “State”), Mr. Lau received his bachelor’s degree in electrical power engineering from California State University, Sacramento.

**Chief Customer Officer.** Brandy Bolden reports to the CEO & GM and oversees SMUD’s Customer and Community Services business unit. She is responsible for customer experience delivery across SMUD’s residential and commercial customer segments. She provides leadership and oversight of customer operations including customer care and revenue management, business intelligence, strategic account management, customer experience and segmentation strategy, channel management, customer program and service delivery, and special assistance.

The Electric System

SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities.

SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through a 230 kilovolt (“kV”) and 115 kV transmission system. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) and the Western Area Power Administration (“WAPA”). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system with the exception of the City’s downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission system. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV substations with overhead and underground 12 kV distribution circuits.

SMUD’s Board of Directors has established the following purpose and vision statements: “SMUD’s purpose is to enhance the quality of life for our customers and community by providing reliable and affordable electricity, and leading the transition to a clean energy future. SMUD’s vision is to be a trusted and powerful partner in achieving an inclusive, zero carbon economy. SMUD will leverage its relationships to accelerate innovation, ensure energy affordability and reliability, protect the environment, eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, catalyze economic and workforce development, promote environmental justice, and enhance community vitality for all.” The Board has adopted a set of Strategic Directions with related metrics, which it considers essential for the success of SMUD and for serving SMUD’s customers. These include competitive rates, access to credit markets, reliability, customer relations, environmental leadership, resource planning, enterprise risk management and safety. Some of the general elements in SMUD’s business strategy are:

- developing and maintaining a sustainable and reliable power supply to meet demand growth consistent with State mandates and the Board’s directions for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions to zero by 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”;
- working closely with customers to provide the information, tools and incentives to assist them to more efficiently manage energy use, which will contribute to meeting greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission targets and managing needle peak demand requirements (those 40 or so hours of the year with extreme temperatures when customer demand surges by up to 400 additional MW);
- managing price, volumetric and credit risks associated with energy and natural gas procurement;
- attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, skilled and engaged workforce that reflects SMUD’s values and is committed to achieving SMUD’s mission;
- retaining local decision making authority and operational independence; and
- collaborating regionally to attract new businesses and grow existing business to diversify and strengthen the Sacramento economy.

SMUD’s long-range business strategy focuses in part on ensuring financial stability by establishing rates that provide an acceptable fixed charge coverage ratio on a consolidated basis, taking into consideration the impact of capital expenditures and other factors on cash flow.

with current energy market prices. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges.”

**Renewable Options.** SMUD’s customers have been increasingly interested in distributed energy resources, mainly through the installation of solar systems. As of December 2023, approximately 51,374 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, approximately 8% of retail customers, had installed solar systems, representing approximately 360 MW of solar installations.

As the cost of energy storage continues to decline, SMUD anticipates an increase in behind-the-meter energy storage, mainly through the installation of battery storage systems. As of December 2023, approximately 1,532 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, had installed storage systems, representing approximately 10 MW of storage.

As another option for solar, SMUD’s SolarShares® pilot program (the “SolarShares Pilot”) was established as a cost-effective and convenient way for commercial customers to meet their energy needs from solar power. The SolarShares Pilot offered SMUD commercial customers the opportunity to receive solar power without upfront costs or equipment installation through 5-, 10- or 20-year purchase contracts. Customers that entered into purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot receive up to half of their power from a utility-scale solar system. SMUD supplies solar power for the SolarShares Pilot either by building and maintaining utility-scale solar systems or by procuring solar power from third parties through power purchase agreements. The SolarShares Pilot generation was approximately 3.2% of retail sales in 2023. As of April 30, 2021, SMUD had completed the SolarShares Pilot and is not entering into new purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot.

Since January 2020, the California Building Code has required all new construction residential buildings under three stories to be powered by photovoltaic solar systems. A new home satisfies this requirement if it installs on-site solar or participates in an approved community solar or energy storage program. In February 2020, SMUD obtained approval from the California Energy Commission (“CEC”) to administer its own community solar program, called Neighborhood SolarShares® (“Neighborhood SolarShares”). SMUD’s Neighborhood SolarShares program can be used by developers of new low-rise residential buildings to satisfy the mandatory solar requirement. See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Rooftop Solar Mandate.” Starting in 2023, the California Building Code’s mandatory solar requirement extends beyond low-rise residential properties, and other changes to the California Building Code’s community solar regulations took effect. SMUD revised its program to align with the new regulations and, in May 2023, obtained approval from the CEC to continue offering its Neighborhood SolarShares compliance option to newly constructed low rise residential homes in its service territory.

In addition to the SolarShares Pilot and Neighborhood SolarShares, SMUD maintains a voluntary green energy pricing program called Greenergy® (“Greenery”). The Greenery program allows customers the opportunity to pay an additional amount per month to ensure that either all or part of their electricity comes from green or carbon free energy sources. In 2023, the program allocated Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) equivalent to approximately 4.2% of retail sales to its participating customers.

**Energy Efficiency.** To further assist customers in managing energy usage and reducing regional carbon emissions and air pollution, SMUD offers an extensive array of energy efficiency and building electrification programs and services including financial incentives, loans, energy audits and education. In addition, SMUD has partnered with local developers to incorporate energy efficiency and all-electric construction measures into new residential and commercial construction, which helps developers plan and design efficient, cost-effective and low or zero-emission buildings. As part of SMUD’s 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), SMUD set a goal for regional carbon emissions through transport and building

# Electrification and Sustainable Power Supply

**Electrification**  
SMUD’s electrification aims to reduce carbon emissions in buildings and transport by 64% over the next 20 years. SMUD’s focus on electrification is continued in the Zero Carbon Plan (defined and discussed below). SMUD was the first electric utility in the country to set its efficiency goals based on carbon reductions, allowing building electrification and energy efficiency to both count toward meeting SMUD’s efficiency goals. This is a significant opportunity, as converting a typical home today to all-electric saves more than three times the carbon emissions compared to doing a major energy efficiency upgrade alone to the same building. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources.”

## Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission

Maintaining a sustainable power supply entails focusing efforts on researching, promoting and implementing new renewable energy technologies and sources to meet SMUD’s long-term commitment to reducing carbon emissions and providing a reliable energy supply. SMUD defines a sustainable power supply as one that reduces SMUD’s GHG emissions to serve retail customer load to zero by 2030. See “– 2030 Zero Carbon Plan” below. SMUD is planning to achieve zero GHG emissions to serve retail customer load through investments in energy efficiency, clean distributed energy resources, renewables portfolio standard (“RPS”) eligible renewables, energy storage, large hydroelectric generation, clean and emissions free fuels, carbon capture and sequestration, and new technologies and business models. Additionally, SMUD plans to continue pursuing GHG emissions reductions through vehicle, building and equipment electrification. At the same time, SMUD’s plans for maintaining a sustainable power supply include assuring the reliability of SMUD’s electric system, minimizing environmental impacts on land, habitat, water and air quality, and maintaining competitive rates relative to other electric providers in the State.

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills regulate GHG emissions and promote sustainable generation alternatives, principally through more stringent RPS. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings” herein.

### 2030 Zero Carbon Plan

In July 2020, the Board declared a climate emergency and adopted a resolution calling for SMUD to take significant and consequential actions to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030. On April 28, 2021, the Board approved SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (the “Zero Carbon Plan”). The Zero Carbon Plan is intended to be a flexible roadmap for SMUD to eliminate carbon emissions from its electricity production by 2030 while maintaining reliable and affordable service. To achieve these goals the Zero Carbon Plan is focused on four main areas: natural gas generation repurposing, proven technologies, new technologies and business models and financial impacts and options. SMUD plans to revisit the Zero Carbon Plan annually.

The natural gas generation repurposing focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for exploring the replacement of two of SMUD’s five Local Gas-Fired Plants (as defined herein) and the retooling of the other three Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” Based on SMUD’s studies to date, SMUD estimates that McClellan (as defined herein) and the Campbell Soup Project (as defined herein) can be replaced in the next several years depending on SMUD’s success with replacement resources. Final decisions about the replacement of these two Local Gas-Fired Plants will be based on additional reliability studies and engagement with the community. As part of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is also exploring converting the Carson Project (as defined herein) and the Procter & Gamble Project (as defined herein) to reliability use operations only and investigating the use of alternative fuels like Renewable Natural Gas-biomethane (RNG-biomanthene), hydrogen and other biofuels for the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, and the Consumers Power Plant (as defined herein). In addition, SMUD is investigating new technologies such as long duration energy storage, carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and other clean fuel alternatives to help support.

**A-9**

The reduction of GHG emissions in SMUD’s energy supply. All final generator configurations are subject to reliability assessments.

The proven clean technologies focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for SMUD to procure approximately 1,100 to 1,500 MW of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (“PV”) generating capacity, 700 to 1,100 MW of local utility-scale battery storage, 300 to 500 MW of wind generating capacity, and 100 to 220 MW of geothermal generating capacity. The Zero Carbon Plan also estimates that customer installation of approximately 500 to 750 MW of behind-the-meter solar PV generating capacity and approximately 50 to 250 MW of behind-the-meter battery storage will assist SMUD with achieving the Zero Carbon Plan goals.

With respect to new technologies and business models, the Zero Carbon Plan focuses on evaluating, prioritizing and scaling the emerging technologies that SMUD expects will have the largest impact on reducing carbon in SMUD’s 2030 resource mix. SMUD is currently focused on various areas of technology and customer-focused programs, including electrification, demand flexibility, virtual power plants, vehicle-to-grid technology, and new grid-scale technologies. The Zero Carbon Plan forecasts that customer-owned devices and SMUD customer-focused programs will contribute between 360 and 1,300 MW of capacity to SMUD’s grid by 2030.

The financial impacts and options focus of the Zero Carbon Plan aims to keep SMUD rate increases at or below the rate of inflation while achieving SMUD’s goal of eliminating carbon emissions from its power supply by 2030. To pay for the expected costs of the Zero Carbon Plan and keep rate increases at or below the rate of inflation, the Zero Carbon Plan estimates the need for SMUD to realize between $50 million and $150 million of sustained annual savings. SMUD currently plans to achieve these sustained annual savings by exploring the implementation of operational savings and pursuing partnership and grant opportunities.

While the ultimate impacts of the Zero Carbon Plan on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy from clean technologies, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers, such impacts could be material.

**Renewable Energy and Climate Change.** The California Renewable Energy Resources Act, established by Senate Bill X1-2 (“SBX1-2”) and the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, enacted by Senate Bill 350 (“SB 350”) require that SMUD meets 33% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2020 and 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2030. Senate Bill 100 (“SB 100”), passed by the legislature and approved by then-Governor Brown on September 10, 2018, accelerates the RPS targets and establishes a new 60% target by 2030. The bill also created a planning goal to meet all of the State’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Renewables Portfolio Standards” for a discussion of the State RPS requirements.

SMUD’s compliance with State RPS requirements is evaluated over 3- or 4-year compliance periods. SMUD met the State RPS requirements for the first compliance period (2011-2013) and second compliance period (2014-2016). The third compliance period (2017-2020) required SMUD to source one-third of its energy from renewable resources, and SMUD had sufficient RECs to meet the third compliance period requirements. SMUD filed its 2020 and third compliance period RPS compliance report with the CEC in the second quarter of 2021 and the CEC adopted SMUD’s third compliance period verification report in December 2023. SMUD expects the confirmation letter from the CEC indicating that SMUD was

in full compliance with its third compliance period RPS obligations in the first quarter of 2024. As of the end of the third compliance period (2020), SMUD had approximately one million surplus RECs available to help meet future RPS targets. SMUD expects to file its 2023 RPS compliance report by July 1, 2024, showing that SMUD will have provided approximately 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources in 2023, which is greater than the interim 2023 RPS target of 41.25%. RPS compliance is determined by compliance period and not by individual years and SMUD anticipates having sufficient surplus procured and/or under contract resources in the fourth compliance period (2021-2024) to be in compliance with the RPS requirements. In addition to meeting RPS standards, SMUD serves an additional 7.4% of its customer load with renewable energy through its voluntary SolarShares and Greenergy pricing programs described above. SMUD estimates that it has sufficient renewable energy deliveries, new power supply contract commitments, new power supply commitments under active discussion, and RPS-eligible surplus carryover to meet its RPS requirements through 2025. Additional resources have been identified that are expected to provide sufficient RPS-eligible resources to cover most of SMUD’s RPS requirements through 2030. Future solicitations may be needed to fill any remaining gaps. The following chart illustrates SMUD’s current RPS requirements through 2030 and its existing and committed resources utilized to meet those requirements.

In addition to procuring new sources, meeting the RPS requirements will require replacement of certain existing renewable contracts which expire in future years. While SMUD anticipates it will meet much of its renewable resource requirements through purchased contracts with third parties, it continues to explore additional options, including wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal developments, partnering with other utilities on future projects, and local development options. SMUD’s resource forecast (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources”) accounts for future renewable resources as a component of “Uncommitted Purchases.” To meet SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan goals, SMUD anticipates meeting loads in 2030 with approximately 70-80% renewable resources, in addition to hydro and other new zero carbon technologies. See “← 2030 Zero Carbon Plan” above.

Given the intermittent nature of power from renewable resources such as wind and solar, SMUD is exploring and investing in options that provide the flexibility to manage the intermittency of such renewable resources. Potential options include energy storage resources, which SMUD has committed to as part of the Zero Carbon Plan, and expanding load management resources. Additionally, on April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its membership in BANC, a joint exercise of powers agency formed in 2009, and currently comprised of SMUD, the Modesto Irrigation District (“MID”), the City of Roseville (“Roseville”), the City of Redding (“Redding”), the City of Shasta Lake and the Trinity Public Utilities District, commenced participation in the California Independent System Operator Corporation (“CAISO”) western energy imbalance market (“WEIM”). Participation in the WEIM benefits SMUD by providing it with broader access to balancing resources within the region to help manage its expanding renewable portfolio. In addition, other entities within the BANC Balancing Authority Area began participation in the WEIM on March 25, 2021. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Operational Independence and Local Control” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

In 2022, SMUD’s Board formally adopted the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan as SMUD’s updated IRP. SMUD filed the approved IRP update with the CEC on September 14, 2022, pursuant to the CEC’s guidelines, which called for updating SMUD’s IRP filing within five years of SMUD’s previous filing of April 29, 2019. SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan built upon the April 2019 IRP and set a goal for zero carbon emissions by 2030. SMUD’s next formal IRP process is expected to be completed and filed with the CEC in 2027. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

The State’s carbon cap-and-trade market established pursuant to Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”) began in 2013. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Greenhouse Gas Emissions” for a discussion of AB 32 and the State’s cap-and-trade program. SMUD anticipates that allowances allocated to SMUD will nearly equal SMUD’s compliance obligations under normal water year conditions. Under low water year conditions, SMUD may need to purchase additional allowances to cover its compliance obligations, including carbon obligations related to wholesale energy sales from SMUD’s natural gas power plants. As SMUD implements its clean power goals, SMUD expects its need for these allowances to decline.

There is scientific consensus that increasing concentrations of GHG have caused and will continue to cause a rise in temperatures in the State and around the world. The change in the earth’s average atmospheric temperature, generally referred to as “climate change,” is, among other things, expected to result in a wide range of changes in climate patterns, including increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including droughts and heat waves, more frequent incidences of wildfires, changes in wind patterns, sea level rise and flooding, any of which alone or in combination could materially adversely affect SMUD’s financial results or operations. See also “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION” and “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY – Other Factors.” As described above, SMUD is actively working to meet its sustainable power supply goals.

reduce its own GHG emissions, and assist the local governments in the territory it serves with their desired GHG reductions. In 2016, SMUD introduced the Pilot Natural Refrigerant Incentive Program, its first customer program providing incentives for GHG reduction in addition to kWh savings. SMUD is a founding member and active participant in the Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative, a public private partnership formed to better understand and plan for climate impacts expected in the region. SMUD is also an active member of the United States Department of Energy (the “DOE”) Partnership for Energy Sector Climate Resilience. SMUD regularly reviews scientific findings related to climate change and in 2016 published its Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan. In 2024, SMUD is planning to update the Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan along with other climate resiliency actions.

**Energy Storage Systems.** Assembly Bill 2514 (“AB 2514”) requires the Board to re-evaluate energy storage goals every three years. In compliance with AB 2514, the Board established a target of 9 MW of energy storage procurement by December 31, 2020, which SMUD has procured. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Energy Storage Systems” for further discussion of AB 2514. In September 2020, the Board directed that energy storage forecasts be implemented through SMUD’s IRP process going forward. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” above for a discussion of SMUD’s IRP. SMUD is also evaluating how to couple utility-scale solar with energy storage to support future system reliability needs and enable energy goals.

**Meeting Peak Load.** A significant consideration for SMUD will be how it addresses its system peak load. SMUD has implemented programs and tools, such as advanced metering, energy efficiency options, and TOD rates for residential customers, to help customers manage their costs while helping SMUD reduce its peak load. Analysis of 2022 data showed a reduction of approximately 108 MW, weather continue to monitor the progress and results of the implementation of TOD rates and will use this information to inform future rate actions and load forecasts. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Time-of-Day Rates.”

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved an optional residential Critical Peak Pricing rate (the “Peak Pricing Rate”), which went into effect June 1, 2022. The Peak Pricing Rate is designed to reduce load by increasing the price of energy when the grid is most impacted, up to 50 hours per summer. In exchange, customers on the rate will receive a per kWh discount on summer Off-Peak and Mid-Peak rates. SMUD is also exploring the use of more distributed energy resources and demand response programs that could further reduce SMUD’s system peak.

**Operational Independence and Local Control.** A key component of SMUD’s business strategy is focused on maintaining its independence in operating and maintaining its resources. As such, SMUD has taken a number of actions to mitigate the potential impacts of various federal and state regulatory actions. For example, in 2002 SMUD established itself as an independent control area (now termed “Balancing Authority”) within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (“WECC”) region. By removing itself from CAISO’s Balancing Authority area, SMUD became responsible for balancing electric supply and demand within its own service territory. This move substantially reduced fees paid to CAISO, preserved operational flexibility and helped to insulate SMUD from the uncertain regulatory environment and tariff structure of CAISO. In addition to decreased financial risks, this independence also reduced SMUD’s exposure to the impacts of capacity and energy shortages in the CAISO Balancing Authority area. Further, as an independent Balancing Authority, SMUD continued to support the statewide electric grid in events of electrical emergencies requiring rotating outages, such as loss of major transmission lines or equipment, as provided in the statewide emergency plan. By 2006, the SMUD Balancing Authority footprint expanded north to the California-Oregon border and south to Modesto, to include the service areas of the WAPA, MID, Redding and Roseville, and TANC-owned 340-mile 500-kV California-Oregon Transmission Project.

# (“COTP”). 

In October 2009, SMUD, with the coordination and cooperation of WAPA, joined the Western Power Pool Reserve Sharing Group, which supports reliability and reduces operating costs. In May 2011, BANC assumed the role of the Balancing Authority, though SMUD continues to oversee operation of the grid on behalf of BANC. BANC members share cost responsibility for balancing authority-related compliance obligations, liabilities, and operations. BANC also serves as an important venue for SMUD and other BANC members to collaborate with respect to operational and market improvements inside the BANC footprint and to preserve their operational independence. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.” On April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its participation in BANC, began operating in the CAISO WEIM, which helps SMUD better manage the integration of renewable energy resources. The CAISO WEIM is a voluntary market, which allows SMUD to maintain its operational independence from the CAISO, while providing SMUD greater access to balancing resources throughout the western region. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

## Electricity, Natural Gas, and Related Hedging

SMUD continues to utilize a comprehensive and integrated power and fuel supply strategy to acquire a reliable and diversified portfolio of resources to meet existing and future needs. This strategy includes a combination of both physical supply and financial hedging transactions to reduce price risk exposure over a five-year horizon. SMUD’s physical supply arrangements include ownership of power generating resources, as well as a diversified portfolio of power and fuel supply purchase contracts that range in duration, with a mixture of fixed and variable pricing terms.

With regard to the power purchase contracts, SMUD has entered into a series of contracts for the purchase of electricity to meet its resource needs. SMUD also actively manages its exposure on variable rate electricity purchases, and at times may enter into financial contracts to fix prices by using options to reduce price risk, in each case when warranted by economic conditions. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements.”

With regard to fuel supply contracts, SMUD utilizes a similar strategy of employing financial contracts of various durations to hedge its variable fuel supply contracts. As of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply – Supply.”

As provided in SMUD’s natural gas contracts, SMUD may be required to post collateral to various counterparties. As of February 29, 2024, SMUD did not have any collateral posting obligations. A decrease in natural gas prices could result in a collateral posting by SMUD. While the posting of collateral is not an expense for SMUD, it does temporarily encumber unrestricted cash balances.

To hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a pass-through rate component called the Hydro Generation Adjustment (the “HGA”), and established a Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund (the “HRSF”). Similarly, to hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a HGA and established a WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund (“WRSF”). These rate stabilization funds and rate pass through mechanisms help to offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs in years where precipitation levels at SMUD-owned and non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities are low. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

![Managing Risks](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Managing+Risks)

**Managing Risks**  
SMUD maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program, a strategic approach to managing enterprise-wide risks as a portfolio, to help reduce the chance of loss, create greater financial stability and protect SMUD resources. It is designed to maintain an early warning system to monitor changes in, and the emergence of, risks that affect the organization’s business objectives. Under the purview of the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee, composed of executive members and chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, ERM conducts ongoing risk identification, assessments, monitoring, mitigation, risk-based budgeting and reporting. To ensure accountability and oversight, each identified risk is assigned to an executive-level risk owner. Risk status and mitigation efforts are reported monthly to the Board.

**Competitive Challenges**  
In the coming decade, utilities like SMUD may face competition from companies in other industries looking to diversify into the energy sector. Examples of developing competitive areas include retail sale of electricity, distributed electric storage resources, renewable distributed generation (mostly solar in Sacramento), customer installation of fuel cells, third-party electric vehicle charging, home or business automation that enables greater customer participation in energy markets, and third-party provision of energy management software and solutions.

SMUD has a wide range of initiatives to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions and new industry participants. Key areas of focus include:

- **Enhancing customer experience.** Recognizing the importance of meeting customer expectations, SMUD introduced the Customer Experience Strategy in 2016 to provide customers “value for what they pay” and further strengthen customer loyalty. The initiative is focused on ensuring SMUD has the people, systems, technology, programs and services to consistently meet or exceed customers’ changing expectations. The customer experience is measured via surveys with the goal of achieving 80% of customers agreeing that SMUD provides them with value for what they pay by 2030.

- **Restructuring electric rates.** In 2017, the Board approved TOD rates as the standard rate for residential customers. The residential rate transition began in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the full transition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. All of SMUD’s business customers are also on time-based rates. In 2019, the Board approved a restructuring of commercial rates to collect a greater portion of fixed costs through fixed charges and to better align time periods and prices with energy markets. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” and “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

- **Ongoing integrated resource planning.** SMUD monitors and updates its integrated resource planning to ensure future sources of energy balance cost, reliability and environmental requirements with the flexibility to meet challenges of changing market and regulatory conditions, customer energy resources, and emerging technologies.

**Leveraging Core Competencies**  
In addition to these initiatives, SMUD is leveraging core competencies to improve industry safety and help communities serve their customers’ energy needs.

![Sacramento Power Academy](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Sacramento Power Academy.** The Sacramento Power Academy is SMUD’s operational training center providing training support for all of SMUD’s skilled trades professionals. Operating on a 10-acre training facility the academy oversees SMUD’s 14 skilled trades apprenticeships. The academy’s experienced training professionals serve as liaisons and mentors to apprentices progressing through on-the-job training, program testing, night schooling, and extensive training components. The academy also ensures SMUD’s skilled trades professionals are safe and compliant by coordinating and delivering annual regulatory and safety training. The academy is also a workforce development hub utilized by SMUD to increase awareness of and interest in skilled trades careers at SMUD, in SMUD’s community, and in the utility industry.

**Community Energy Services.** In 2002, Assembly Bill 117 was passed to establish Community Choice Aggregation in the State by authorizing Community Choice Aggregators (“CCAs”) to aggregate customer electric load and purchase electricity for customers. SMUD’s Community Energy Services department was established in 2017 to support organizations with values closely aligned with SMUD’s values, while also generating additional revenue for SMUD. CCA programs are proliferating in the State thanks to support for expanding renewable energy use and desire for local control particularly for electricity procurement. There are numerous CCAs operating in the State, and more are anticipated to launch in the future. CCAs are responsible for procuring wholesale power, setting the generation rate, and staffing a call center to handle opt-outs and questions about the power portfolio. The local investor-owned utility (“IOU”) continues to deliver electricity from the electric grid, maintain its electric infrastructure, bill customers and collect payments.

In October 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Valley Clean Energy (“VCE”) to provide technical, energy and support services, including data management and call center services, while also overseeing services and business operations support, to VCE for a term set to expire in 2023. SMUD and VCE recently executed a new contract for data management, contact center, consulting and debt collection services that expires on December 31, 2028. VCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the City of Woodland, the City of Davis and Yolo County to implement a local CCA program. The service territory expanded to include the City of Winters in 2021. The mission of VCE is to deliver cost-competitive clean electricity, product choice, price stability, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions to its customers in Yolo County. VCE began electric services to its customers in the summer of 2018, giving Yolo County residents a choice between two electricity providers, VCE and PG&E.

In November 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of East Bay Community Energy (“EBCE”) to provide call center and data management services for a three-year term beginning in January 2018. SMUD signed a new contract with EBCE in January 2022 for call center and data management services for an additional three-year term. EBCE recently changed its name to Ava Community Energy (“Ava”). Ava is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro and Union City in Alameda County to implement a local CCA program. Ava expanded its territory to the cities of Pleasanton, Newark, and Tracy in April 2021.

In June 2019, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Silicon Valley Clean Energy (“SVCE”) to provide program services to help local SVCE communities reduce carbon pollution while delivering engaging customer experiences. SVCE programs are focused on grid integration, as well as electrifying transportation, buildings and homes. This contract was extended through September of 2024. In June 2023, SMUD was selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s concierge service vendor for three years. In December 2023, SMUD was again selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s programs administrator for five years. SVCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Campbell, Cupertino, Gilroy, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill,

Mountain View, Saratoga, Sunnyvale and Unincorporated Santa Clara County to implement a local CCA program.

In July 2022, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Marin Clean Energy (“MCE”) to provide data management, billing, data analytic and system assessment services to MCE. MCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2010 and represents 37 member communities across four Bay Area counties: Contra Costa, Marin, Napa and Solano.

In September 2022, SMUD was selected through a competitive process by the governing board of Sonoma Clean Power (“SCP”) to provide market research services to SCP. In January of 2023, SMUD was selected to provide strategic consulting services, providing recommendations related to programs and marketing. SCP is a joint powers agency that serves Sonoma and Mendocino counties.

While CCAs have had success in the State, they are susceptible to business, regulatory and other risks that could lead to a financial loss and/or result in a cessation of operations for the CCA. These risks could extend to a CCA’s counterparties, including SMUD. SMUD has made an effort to identify and mitigate potential counterparty risks to the extent possible in service agreements with the CCAs described above. SMUD may pursue opportunities to provide similar services to additional CCAs in the future. SMUD management does not expect its current arrangements to have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

## FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION

### Precipitation Variability

SMUD uses a precipitation measuring station located at Fresh Pond, California to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s Upper American River Project (the “UARP”) hydropower reservoir. As of January 31, 2024, precipitation at Fresh Pond, California totaled 21 inches for the October-September hydropower water supply period. This is 75% of the 50-year rolling median of 28 inches. Total reservoir storage in the UARP hydropower reservoirs was 238 thousand acre-feet as of January 31, 2024, which was about 63% of capacity and approximately 6% above the historical average. SMUD manages its reservoirs to maximize water storage going into the summer season, which preserves generating capacity during SMUD’s high load months and ensures that SMUD meets its UARP FERC license requirements, including requirements for recreational and environmental flows.

There can be wide swings in precipitation from year to year. In years with below average rainfall, SMUD may have to generate or purchase replacement energy at additional cost. To hedge against variations in the volume of energy received from SMUD-owned UARP hydroelectric resources, SMUD uses the HRSF to help offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

SMUD is also exposed to precipitation variability through its contract with the WAPA. In an average water year this contract provides roughly 661 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of power. WAPA’s actual deliveries are based on hydroelectric generation (minus energy used for pumping) at Central Valley Project reservoirs in Northern California, which varies based on annual precipitation patterns, water deliveries for agriculture, and flow requirements in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Unlike the UARP, SMUD does not monitor precipitation stations to approximate power deliveries under the WAPA contract, and instead relies on a forecast of power deliveries from WAPA. As of January 31, 2024, WAPA has forecasted power deliveries of 703 GWh for 2024, approximately 6% more than an average water year. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration.”

![Wildfires](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Wildfires)

**Wildfires**

**General.** Wildfires in the State have become increasingly common and destructive. Frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased, and could further increase, the possibility of wildfires occurring in areas where SMUD maintains generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The number of diseased and dead trees has increased, and could further increase this possibility. As a result, SMUD faces an increased risk that it may be required to pay for wildfire related property damage or
<!-- Page 471 -->
![Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory)](https://example.com/image.png)

**Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory).** In 2018, the CPUC approved a new statewide fire map that identifies areas of elevated and extreme wildfire risk from utility-associated assets located throughout the State. SMUD directly participated in the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map. In connection with the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map, a peer review and a team of independent nationwide experts led by Cal Fire affirmed that SMUD’s electric service area is properly located outside of these elevated (“Tier 2”) and extreme (“Tier 3”) high fire threat areas; however, SMUD’s UARP facilities are located within both Tier 2 and Tier 3 areas. According to the CPUC, Tier 2 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an elevated wildfire risk from utility assets and Tier 3 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an extreme risk from utility assets. As of June 8, 2021, approximately 37 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 19 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. SMUD is also a member of TANC. As of July 2022, approximately 116.3 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 4.5 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. In accordance with its FERC license, SMUD adheres to a FERC-approved Fire Prevention and Response Plan for its UARP facilities. On May 17, 2018, in accordance with State law, SMUD’s Board of Directors determined that the UARP area may have a “significant risk of catastrophic wildfire” resulting from overhead electric facilities and that SMUD’s FERC-approved UARP Fire Prevention and Response Plan meets requirements for presenting wildfire mitigation measures to the Board for its approval.

**Wildfire Mitigation.** In response to potential wildfire risk, SMUD has implemented and is continuing to implement a series of measures intended to prevent wildfires from occurring, minimize the spread of any fire that does occur and improve the resiliency of its system. These measures include an increase in the number of inspections for fuel reduction inside and adjacent to rights-of-ways, utilization of Cal Fire-approved vegetation management material to reduce the risk of spark generation; enhanced inspection and maintenance programs; increased use of ignition-reduction techniques, including undergrounding of conductors; increased monitoring of identified responses to fire conditions, including operational procedures for the de-energization of lines during high fire conditions; and elimination of automatic reclosing on SMUD’s transmission lines and on SMUD’s distribution lines in certain areas during fire season.

SMUD’s proactive approach to vegetation management has been expanded to include the use of advanced technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (“LiDAR”), ortho and oblique imagery that is used to pinpoint tree health and/or condition that may not yet be visible to the naked eye. In addition, SMUD has installed additional weather stations in transmission corridors and substations for increased situational awareness and has continued coordination and collaboration with local agencies and first responders as well as vulnerable populations.

State legislation enacted in 2018 and 2019 (SB 901 and AB 1054, respectively) requires publicly owned utilities (“POUs”) to prepare and present Wildfire Mitigation Plans to their governing boards by January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter. SB 901 requires POUs, including SMUD, before January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, to prepare a wildfire mitigation plan and present it in a public meeting to their governing board. SB 901 requires POU’s to accept comments on the wildfire mitigation plan from the public, other local and State agencies, and interested parties, and to verify that the plan complies with all applicable rules, regulations, and standards, as appropriate. The bill requires a qualified independent evaluator to review and assess the comprehensiveness of its wildfire mitigation plan and present its report to the board in a public meeting. AB 1054 created a new Wildfire Safety Division within the CPUC to prioritize wildfire safety throughout the State, and established an appointed Wildfire Safety Advisory Board (“WSAB”) to advise and make recommendations relating to wildfire safety to this new Division. For POUs, the bill requires submittal of annual wildfire mitigation plans to the WSAB for review and advisory opinions relating to the content and sufficiency of the plans.

A-18
<!-- Page 472 -->
SMUD assembled an enterprise-wide team of subject-matter experts to prepare its plan in compliance with this legislation. SMUD’s initial Wildfire Mitigation Plan (“WMP”) was adopted by the Board in the fourth quarter of 2019, after circulation for public comment and review of the comprehensiveness of the plan by a qualified independent evaluator. The WMP and evaluator’s report were submitted to the WSAB in 2020.

SMUD reviews its WMP each year, presenting the updated plan to the Board for adoption at duly noticed public meetings. The updated plans and evaluator reports are submitted to the WSAB for advisory opinion and recommendations. SMUD responds to the WSAB’s comments regarding SMUD’s WMP as part of its WMP process. SMUD will continue to annually review and update its WMP, conducting a comprehensive review at least every third year.

SMUD recently completed a comprehensive review and update of its WMP after soliciting public input and independent evaluation. The 2023-2025 WMP was adopted by the Board on June 15, 2023, and duly submitted to the WSAB.

**Wildfire Insurance.** Wildfires both in California and nationally have not only increased potential liability for utilities, but have also adversely impacted the insurance markets, leading to higher costs for coverage; coverages becoming prohibitively expensive; limited or restricted coverage to certain types of risks; or coverage at insufficient levels. SMUD most recently renewed its general and wildfire liability insurance coverage on June 15, 2023, increasing the coverage limit by $25 million to $275 million. SMUD increased the commercially insured portion of its wildfire coverage program from $176 million to $212.5 million and maintained the self-insured layers and quota share portions of the coverage at $6.5 million.

In addition, it is expected that SMUD will have a portion of the $500 million aggregate amount of its commercial paper and line of credit program to provide operational flexibility in the event of the occurrence of a wildfire or other operational event. However, SMUD has not covenanted to maintain the availability of the commercial paper program and line of credit program for these purposes and no assurances can be given that the commercial paper and line of credit program will be available at the time of, or during, such an event.

**August 2020 Heat Wave**

The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from August 14, 2020 through August 18, 2020. The CAISO was forced to institute rotating electricity outages in the State during this extreme heat wave. SMUD, as a member of BANC, and being outside of the CAISO did not have to implement any planned power disruptions. Additionally, SMUD was able to support the CAISO during some hours of the heat wave with both requested emergency assistance and wholesale market sales. SMUD’s peak demand between August 14, 2020 and August 18, 2020, varied between 2,874 MW and 3,057 MW, well below SMUD’s record peak of 3,299 MW.

**September 2022 Heat Wave**

The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from September 5, 2022 through September 8, 2022. On September 6, 2022, SMUD experienced its second highest peak demand of 3,263 MW. SMUD did not have to implement any planned power disruptions.

**Storm Damage**

In January 2023, SMUD experienced a series of winter storms that brought heavy rains and high winds causing damage to SMUD’s grid and widespread outages for SMUD’s customers. By the time the  
A-19

**storm response was complete, SMUD had experienced the largest mobilization of personnel and restoration crews in its history. SMUD incurred costs related to removing downed trees, restoring power from downed poles and broken lines, replenishing inventory, communicating with and providing assistance to customers, maintaining IT systems, and coordinating with local emergency agencies. SMUD is pursuing claims with Federal and State agencies to attempt to recover certain of SMUD’s costs related to the storms. The material financial impacts have been reflected in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, [which are included in APPENDIX B].**

**Cosumnes Power Plant Outage**

On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant (as defined herein) was shut down due to a ground fault in the Steam Turbine Generator (“STG”) stator. The ground fault was caused by delamination of the insulation on one of the through bolts. Damage from the ground fault resulted in a full rewind and restack of the stator core, replacement of all stator through bolts, and a full rewind of turbine rotor. The Cosumnes Power Plant repairs were completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. During the extended outage, SMUD shifted generation to the other local gas-fired plants and the Sutter Energy Center and procured additional energy and resource adequacy capacity. SMUD also requested and received approval from the California Air Quality Board and California Energy Commission to operate one or both of the gas turbines without the STG. During the September 2022 heatwave, both of the gas turbines at the Cosumnes Power Plant were operated without the STG, providing 270 MW at peak.

To mitigate the financial impact of unplanned outages from its thermal assets, SMUD carries commercial property insurance with a business interruption endorsement. At the time of the loss, the coverage provided up to $30.8 million of business interruption recovery per month at the Cosumnes Power Plant, with a sub-limit of $310 million over any 18-month period. During the period of loss, claims were subject to a $5 million equipment damage deductible and a 60-day business interruption claims waiting period.

SMUD has settled the equipment damage portion of the loss for $18.6 million, resulting in a $13.6 million recovery. The business interruption portion of the claim remains in process, with SMUD receiving a $50 million advance in December of 2022. As of January 2024, the carriers have confirmed an additional $51 million in undisputed recovery, which is anticipated to be received in the first quarter of 2024. Thus far, SMUD has recovered $114.6 million of the loss and will continue to work toward full settlement of the disputed portion of the claim, which is approximately $68 million.

**Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic**

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD has lessened since the height of the pandemic in 2020, SMUD is still experiencing impacts from the pandemic. However, compared to weather adjusted load levels, SMUD’s overall load is near or above pre-pandemic levels.

Part of the governmental response to the economic consequences of the pandemic required utility providers (including SMUD) to provide additional grace periods and flexible payment plans for the payment of utility bills or to refrain from pursuing collection remedies for unpaid bills for a period of time. SMUD also implemented a no-shutoff policy through January 2022 under which SMUD did not disconnect power to a customer for non-payment of their electric bill. Beginning in February 2022, SMUD resumed its normal payment, late fee, and disconnection process and began disconnections of unpaid accounts in late April 2022. As a result, SMUD has experienced an increase in delinquencies for customer electric accounts versus pre-pandemic levels. In December 2021, SMUD received $41 million from the California Arrearage Payment Program (“CAPP”) initial funding, and an additional $9.9 million in 2022. All funds were applied to delinquent balances. As of December 31, 2023, the total delinquencies for customer electric accounts were approximately $68 million.
<!-- Page 474 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

accounts were $38.2 million, after the CAPP credit, which is an increase from the February 2020 balance of total delinquencies for customer electric accounts of $16.9 million. The financial impacts stemming from delinquent accounts have been accounted for in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the preceding years. Any successful recovery of delinquent accounts will contribute to an increase in net income.

SMUD also paused the recertification process for existing customers in SMUD’s low-income discount program during the pandemic. The number of customers participating in the low-income assistance program increased by 16,407, or approximately 22% from February 2020 to December 2023. SMUD has resumed the recertification process for existing customers in the low-income discount program in 2023.

While the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD have lessened, if the pandemic and its consequences again become more severe or another similar event occurs, the impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations could be material.

## RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE

### Rates and Charges

SMUD’s Board of Directors has autonomous authority to establish the rates charged for all SMUD services. Unlike IOUs and some other municipal utility systems, retail rate and revenue levels are not subject to review or regulation by any other federal, State or local governmental agencies. Changes to SMUD rates only require formal action by the Board of Directors after two public workshops and a public hearing. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government. SMUD typically reviews and sets rates on a two-year cycle.

### 2019 Rate Action.

On June 24, 2019, the Board approved a 3.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2020, a 3.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2020, a 2.50% rate increase effective January 1, 2021, and a 2.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2021, for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved a restructuring of the commercial rates, including new time periods and an overall increase in the fixed bill components, such as the System Infrastructure Fixed Charge and demand charges, and a corresponding decrease in energy charges, making the restructuring revenue neutral by rate category. To minimize bill impacts, rate categories will be restructured over an eight-year period.

### 2021 Rate Action.

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved a 1.5% rate increase effective March 1, 2022 and a 2.0% rate increase effective January 1, 2023 for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved the Solar and Storage Rate, the optional residential Peak Pricing Rate, and updates to certain schedules of SMUD’s Open Access Transmission Tariff (“OATT”). The Board also approved a new timeline for the commercial rate restructure transition, and all impacted commercial customers were transitioned to the new rates by the end of the first quarter of 2022.

SMUD also implemented a solar interconnection fee based on the size of solar interconnection and supporting programs such as battery incentives, incentives to enroll in SMUD’s Peak Pricing Rate, battery incentives for Virtual Power Plants, and a program to bring the benefits of solar to under-resourced multi-family communities. These programs and fees are not subject to Board approval. 

A-21
<!-- Page 475 -->
![2023 Rate Action](https://example.com/image.png)

**2023 Rate Action**

On September 21, 2023, the Board approved a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2025, and a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2025 for all customer classes. The Board also approved establishing the Energy Assistance Program Rate (“EAPR”) Rate Stabilization Fund, which will provide an additional discount to those low-income customers with the greatest need. The discount will be funded with discretionary, non-retail rate revenue, as to not have an impact on any future required rate changes. There is currently pending litigation concerning the adoption of the 2023 rates. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”

**Rate Stabilization Funds**

The Rate Stabilization Fund (“RSF”) is maintained by SMUD to reduce the need for future rate increases when costs exceed existing rates. At the direction of the Board, amounts may be either transferred into the RSF (which reduces revenues) or transferred out of the RSF (which increases revenues). The Board authorizes RSF transfers on an event driven basis. The RSF includes funds to hedge variations in the volume of energy received from WAPA hydroelectric generation, variation in AB 32 revenue and variations in Low Carbon Fuel Credit (“LCFS”) revenue. As of December 31, 2023, the balance in the RSF was $115.8 million, which is approximately 7.2% of annual retail revenue.

Effective July 2008, SMUD implemented the HGA, which is a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from the UARP (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric”). The HGA is designed to increase the deposits to the HRSF in wet years when SMUD has more hydroelectric generation than expected. Each year SMUD determines the impact of precipitation variances on projected hydroelectric generation from the UARP. When the precipitation variance results in a deficiency of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, transfers from the HRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is zero. When the precipitation variance results in a projected surplus of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, deposits will be made into the HRSF in an amount approximating the positive impact to SMUD from the surplus hydroelectric generation (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is not sufficient to cover transfers that would otherwise be made in the event of a projected deficiency in UARP hydroelectric generation, a 12-month HGA surcharge will automatically be included on customers’ electric bills at a level that generates up to 4% of retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue on any precipitation variance calculation date and the precipitation variance results in a projected UARP hydroelectric generation surplus, the positive impact of the surplus may be used for other purposes at staff’s recommendation, with the approval of the Board, including returned to customers through an electric bill discount up to 4% of retail revenue. SMUD calculates HRSF transfers based on an April-March (water year) precipitation period at Fresh Pond, California. This precipitation station is used to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s UARP hydropower reservoirs. As of January 31, 2024, and based on the current HRSF water year precipitation forecast, SMUD anticipates transferring $20.8 million out of the HRSF in April 2024.

In September 2023, SMUD added a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from WAPA. Each year SMUD determines the WAPA Energy Delivery Variance (“EDV”) based on forecasted energy delivery minus the actual energy delivery. When the EDV variance is positive, transfers from the WRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 2% of cash).

**Low Income Discount**

As of December 2023, approximately 91,407 customers received the low-income discount offered by SMUD, which represents approximately 16% of all residential customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, SMUD suspended recertification during the pandemic. In 2023, the total discount was approximately $32.7 million. As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn, SMUD experienced an increase in low-income discount applicants. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

While the low-income discount has provided substantial benefits to low-income customer bills for years, multiple economic variables, such as inflation and rate increases, have had disproportionately negative impacts on low-income customers, particularly those in the 0-50% Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”). In 2023, SMUD established an EAPR Rate Stabilization Fund (“ERSF”) to provide an additional discount to the electricity usage charge up to an established maximum discount (“ERSF Additional Discount”) for customers in the 0-50% FPL. The ERSF is funded by discretionary non-retail rate revenue, reviewed on an annual basis, and the specific monthly ERSF Additional Discount is set before the year the value is in effect. SMUD expanded its programs and services starting in 2016 to help customers with energy assistance, home improvement packages and education.

# Customer Base; Largest Customers

A stabilizing influence on SMUD’s revenues is that a substantial proportion is derived from residential customers (49.2% in 2023). Historically, revenue from commercial and industrial consumption has been more sensitive to economic fluctuation. Furthermore, SMUD has no dominant customers that account for a significant percentage of annual revenues. In 2023, no single customer contributed more than 3% of revenues. The top ten customers generated approximately 9% of revenues and the top 30 generated approximately 15% of revenues. The following table presents information on SMUD’s top ten customers as of December 31, 2023.

# Power Generation Facilities

## Hydroelectric
The UARP consists of three relatively large storage reservoirs (Union Valley, Loon Lake and Ice House) with an aggregate water storage capacity of approximately 400,000 acre-feet and eight small reservoirs. Project facilities also include eight tunnels with a combined length of over 26 miles and eight powerhouses containing 11 turbines. In addition to providing clean hydroelectric power and operating flexibility for SMUD, the UARP area provides habitat for fish and wildlife and a variety of recreational opportunities, including camping, fishing, boating, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and cross-country skiing.

The combined capacity of the UARP is approximately 685 MW at SMUD’s load center in Sacramento. Under current licensing and mean water conditions, these facilities are expected to generate approximately 1,600 GWh of electric energy annually, which represents approximately 15% of SMUD’s current average annual retail energy requirements. In 1957, the Federal Power Commission (predecessor agency to FERC) issued a license to SMUD for the UARP. This 50-year license was subsequently amended to add and upgrade facilities and now includes all segments of SMUD’s hydroelectric facilities located on the South Fork of the American River and its tributaries upstream from the Chili Bar Project (described below). On July 23, 2014, FERC issued to SMUD a new 50-year license for the UARP.

On November 9, 2016 FERC issued an Order authorizing SMUD to construct the South Fork Powerhouse downstream of the UARP’s Slab Creek Dam. Construction was substantially completed in the fall of 2020, and the new powerhouse was placed into operation on October 25, 2022, adding 1.8 MW of generation to the UARP’s overall capacity.

On June 16, 2021, pursuant to Board authorization, SMUD approved the Chili Bar Hydroelectric Project which consists of a 7 MW powerhouse, reservoir, dam and spillway, north of Placerville on the South Fork of the American River for approximately $10.4 million (the “Chili Bar Project”). The Chili Bar Project is immediately downstream from the UARP and operates as the regulating reservoir for the UARP’s largest powerhouse. Owning the UARP and the Chili Bar Project enables SMUD to operate the two projects with a holistic approach to license compliance and generation efficiency.

## Solano 2 Wind Project
SMUD owns and operates an 87 MW wind project, located in Solano County, known as Solano 2. Solano 2 consists of 29 wind turbine generators (“WTGs”) rated at 3.0 MW. Energy from the project is collected at 21 kV and transmitted over a dedicated 3-mile overhead system to the SMUD-owned Russell substation. At the Russell facility, the energy is transformed to 230 kV and interconnected to PG&E’s Birds Landing Switching Station. Energy deliveries are scheduled through the CAISO.

## Solano 3 Project
In 2011 and 2012, SMUD constructed a 128 MW wind project adjacent to Solano Phase 2, known as Solano 3. The Solano 3 project consists of 31 WTGs rated at 1.8 MW and 24 WTGs rated at 3.0 MW. The project interconnects through a 34.5 kV underground collection system to the Russell substation. Like the Solano Phase 2 project, this energy is transformed to 230 kV and delivered through the CAISO.

## Solano 4 Project
SMUD has developed the Solano 4 Wind Project on land with a wind easement owned by SMUD near the Solano 3 project, known as the Collinsville and Roberts properties, to install 10 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW, and to remove the Solano 1 turbines and replace them with 9 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW. SMUD has met all of the CAISO requirements and has executed a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement (“GLIA”) as of June 2021 that will allow for 90.8 MW of capacity at the point of interconnection. In April 2021, SMUD submitted an application for advisory review by the Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (the “Solano ALUC”) of the Solano 4 Wind Project’s consistency.

with the 2015 Travis Air Force Base Land Use Compatibility Plan (the “Travis Plan”). In May 2021, the Solano ALUC purported to resolve that the Solano 4 Wind Project was inconsistent with the Travis Plan. In August 2021, the Board approved the Project Environmental Impact Report, made findings overriding the Solano ALUC’s finding of inconsistency, made findings there was no alternative to the project, and approved the Solano 4 Wind Project. In September 2021, Solano County filed a writ petition challenging SMUD’s approval of the Solano 4 Wind Project based on procedural environment, zoning and land use grounds. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 14, 2022, and the suit was dismissed on January 10, 2023. The settlement agreement allows for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project as planned.

In addition, SMUD applied for and obtained extensions of the Federal Aviation Administration Determinations of No Hazard allowing for construction of the turbines. A contract for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project was awarded to Vestas Corporation and the Solano 4 Wind Project is currently under construction. The expected operation date for the Solano 4 Wind Project is May 2024. PG&E identified upgrades needed to interconnect the Solano 4 Wind Project that will not be complete before the expected Solano 4 commercial operation date. PG&E has an approved project and expects to complete the needed upgrades by May of 2025. Realization of the full capacity of the Solano 4 Wind Project may be delayed into the second quarter of 2025 due to the timeframe established for the PG&E required transmission upgrades. SMUD has developed a mitigation plan for the limited interconnection capacity for the first year of operation, in coordination with CAISO and PG&E, of using all of the existing SMUD Solano Russell substation interconnection capacity combined for the dispatch of all the Solano Wind Project. SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process, which combines all phases of the Solano Wind Project so it may operate as one project. This was fully executed by SMUD, CAISO, and PG&E on February 27, 2023.

As of the end of 2023, all of the turbine site delivery roads and foundations for the Solano 4 Project have been completed, all of the turbine components have been delivered to the Solano 4 Project site and 10 of the Solano 4 Project turbines have been fully erected.

At the completion of the Solano 4 project, SMUD will have an installed wind capacity of 303 MW in connection with the overall Solano Wind Project, leaving 18 MW at the point of interconnection for future development.

**Distributed Solar Photovoltaic.** SMUD owns and operates approximately 2 MW of solar photovoltaic generating facilities. These facilities include installations at the Hedge Substation property, SMUD Headquarters, the East Campus Operations Center, and other smaller photovoltaic systems throughout the service area on parking lots.

**Hedge Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 4 MW, 8 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached commercial operation in January 2023.

**ESS Flow Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 0.45 MW, 3 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached test operation in September 2023, and commercial operation is planned for March 2024.

**Local Gas-Fired Plants.** SMUD constructed five local natural gas-fired plants in its service area: the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, the Campbell Soup Project, McClellan and the Cosumnes Power Plant (each defined below). These five plants are referred to collectively as the “Local Gas-Fired Plants.” These plants are a strategic component of SMUD’s resource mix. In addition to providing SMUD a total capacity of approximately 1,139 MW, the Local Gas-Fired Plants provide SMUD with needed

**Local Gas-Fired Plants Overview**

SMUD has entered into long-term agreements with SFA providing for the purchase by SMUD of all of the power from each of the Local Gas-Fired Plants on a take-or-pay basis. This consolidation created operational and administrative efficiencies without changing any of the functionality of the power plants. Although the Local Gas-Fired Plants are owned by SFA, SMUD has exclusive control of their dispatch and manages their operations as part of its overall power supply strategy.

Payments under the power purchase agreements are payable from the revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of the principal of or interest on SMUD’s Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the caption “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below), as are other maintenance and operation costs and energy payments. For further discussion of SMUD’s obligations to make these payments to SFA, see “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Joint Powers Authorities.”

**Description of the Five Local Gas-Fired Plants:**

1. **The Cosumnes Power Plant (the “Cosumnes Power Plant”)**  
   The Cosumnes Power Plant is a 612 MW natural gas-fired, combined cycle plant located in the southern portion of Sacramento County adjacent to SMUD’s decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant. Commercial operation of the Cosumnes Power Plant commenced on February 24, 2006. SFA increased the net generating capacity of the facility by 81 MWs via an Advanced Gas Path (“AGP”) upgrade. The additional AGP generation was realized after related and software upgrades were completed. The Cosumnes Power Plant is owned by SFA, a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and MID. The existing take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA expires no earlier than when the related bonds have been paid in full (the outstanding related bonds are scheduled to mature on July 1, 2030). On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant was shut down due to a ground fault in the STG stator. The repair was completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Cosumnes Power Plant Outage”.

2. **The Carson Cogeneration Project (the “Carson Project”)**  
   The Carson Project, a 103 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project consisting of separate cycle and peaking plants, provides steam to the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) wastewater treatment plant adjacent to the site. The Carson Project was originally owned by the Central Valley Financing Authority (“CVFA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and the SRCSD. Construction of the Carson Project was completed and the plant began commercial operation on October 11, 1995. The CVFA bonds issued to finance the Carson Project were defeased in September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Carson Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

3. **The Procter & Gamble Cogeneration Project (the “Procter & Gamble Project”)**  
   The Procter & Gamble Project, a 182 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, is located in an established industrial area of Sacramento. The initial combined cycle portion of the plant began commercial operation on March 1, 1997. Construction of the peaking plant portion of the Procter & Gamble Project commenced during 2000 and the unit achieved commercial status on April 24, 2001. The Procter & Gamble Project produces steam for use in Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company’s oleochemical manufacturing processes and electricity for sale to SMUD. The Procter & Gamble Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Cogeneration Authority (“SCA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA, a separate joint powers authority. The SCA bonds issued to finance the Procter & Gamble Project were defeased in
<!-- Page 485 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Procter & Gamble Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Procter & Gamble Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

The Campbell Soup Cogeneration Project (the “Campbell Soup Project”). The Campbell Soup Project, a 170 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project, was completed and began commercial operations on December 4, 1997. Upgrades were implemented during 2000, which increased the plant’s peaking capacity to 180 MW, well above its net demonstrated capacity of 159.8 MW. The plant is located in south Sacramento adjacent to the Capital Commerce Center (formerly the Campbell Soup Company food processing facility). The Campbell Soup Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Power Authority (“SPA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA. The SPA bonds issued to finance the Campbell Soup Project were redeemed in July 2015. In late 2021, ownership of the Campbell Soup Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Campbell Soup Project (the “Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA”) covers both the Campbell Soup Project and McClellan and will be in effect until terminated by SMUD. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing the Campbell Soup Project in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

The McClellan Gas Turbine (“McClellan”). McClellan is a 72 MW natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine generating plant at McClellan Business Park in Sacramento. This turbine is connected to SMUD’s electric system and is operated to meet SMUD’s peak-load requirements. McClellan is aligned for remote starting and operation with both black start and fast start capabilities. SMUD constructed the McClellan unit in 1986 as a 50 MW emergency power source for the McClellan Air Force Base. In 2001, following the Air Force base closure, McClellan was repurposed for SMUD’s use. In May 2007, SMUD transferred ownership of McClellan to SPA for more efficient operation. SPA did not issue debt related to McClellan. In late 2021, ownership of McClellan was transferred to SFA. SFA pays all costs of operations and maintenance through to SMUD in accordance with the terms of the Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA. In exchange for paying all costs related to McClellan, SMUD receives all of the power generated thereby on a take-or-pay basis. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing McClellan in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

Fuel Supply

General. SMUD is obligated to arrange for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Management of the natural gas procurement and delivery process is a key focus of SMUD’s reliability and risk policies. Although the natural gas consumption of the power plants for SMUD’s load can vary significantly depending on the season, precipitation, and the market price of power and natural gas, the plants are forecasted to need, on average in 2024, a total of approximately 91,000 Decatherms per day (“Dth/day”) with a daily peak slightly more than 171,000 Dth/day of natural gas. SMUD has implemented a comprehensive strategy to secure a reliable and diversified fuel supply through a variety of agreements for the supply, transportation, and storage of natural gas.

Supply. SMUD hedges a significant portion of its expected gas needs to meet customer power requirements. This includes gas for the Local Gas-Fired Plants and for the Sutter Energy Center. See “Power Purchase Agreements – Sutter Energy Center”. This is accomplished through a combination of long-term supply arrangements and an exposure reduction program. The program consists of a primarily rolling three-year exposure reduction component, a fuel hedging component on a rolling three-year basis, as well as supplemental fixed calendar year components reaching out up to five calendar years. Long-term

A-32
<!-- Page 486 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

arrangements may consist of a combination of physical commodity supply contracts, financial hedges, or options. Natural gas is purchased from a wide variety of producers and marketers at the northern and southern California borders, and from the San Juan and the Rocky Mountain supply basins. SMUD has a number of both fixed-price supply agreements and financial hedging contracts to fix gas costs ranging from one month to several years in duration. Including fixed price biogas contracts as of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted.

SMUD has contracted with NCGA to purchase an approximate average of 8,700 Dth/day over the remaining life of a contract expiring May 31, 2027 (the “NCGA Contract”). Under the NCGA contract, SMUD pays a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. Until November 1, 2023 the delivery point for the NCGA Contract was the AECO hub in Alberta. Starting November 1, 2023, to increase delivery efficiencies, SMUD has exchanged the gas delivered at the AECO hub under the NCGA Contract with gas delivered at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border. From there SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants.

SMUD has also contracted with NCEA to purchase an approximately 22,000 Dth/day on average, or to be converted to the appropriate cash flow value in Megawatt-hours (“MWh”) of electricity over the remaining life of a contract expiring on May 31, 2049. The gas will be delivered to the SMUD system via the Malin receipt point on the PG&E backbone system. SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants. SMUD will pay a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. In connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement), SMUD expects to amend and restate the contract with NCEA in connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement.) [adjust for 2024 Senior Bonds offering documents]

Renewable Natural Gas Supply. As a component of meeting SMUD’s RPS goals, SMUD procures renewable natural gas and digesters gas as fuels to generate renewable electricity from the Cosumnes Power Plant. Descriptions of the renewable natural gas supply agreements are provided below.

In March 2009, SMUD entered into a 15-year contract (that qualifies as renewable energy) with Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (“Shell Energy”) to purchase up to 6,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from a landfill project in Texas. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in April 2009. In March 2012, SMUD amended the contract with Shell Energy to increase the maximum volumes to 7,300 Dth/day and extended the term by 10 years to March 31, 2034. Currently, the delivery point is PG&E Topock and SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In 2016, SMUD entered into a 3-year contract with Shell Energy to sell back the entire volume of renewable natural gas purchased, less 500 Dth/day, to be sold into the vehicle transportation markets. Upon expiration of the initial 3-year contract for the sale of biogas to Shell Energy, SMUD extended the sell back of the entire volume of biogas twice for an additional three years with Element Markets (now RNG, LLC), starting in 2020 and 2023. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

SMUD contracted with Heartland Renewable Energy, LLC (“HRE”) in December 2009 for a 20-year supply of up to 7,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas from a digester facility in Colorado. Deliveries began in March of 2014. Currently, the delivery point is Opal, Wyoming and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. HRE has not delivered volumes from the project to SMUD since December 2016 due to litigation with Weld County, Colorado regarding odor and
<!-- Page 487 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

permit issues. EDF Renewables, the majority owner of HRE, notified SMUD in August of 2017 that it is in discussions with a short list of bidders to sell its interests in the facility. In June of 2020, the project was purchased and SMUD’s contract was assigned to the new owner, Platte River Biogas, LLC (“PRB”). SMUD and PRB reached a settlement in the third quarter of 2021 that could lead to terminating the contract.

In September 2011, SMUD and CVFA entered into a “Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement” through which the Carson Project cleans nearly all of the digester gas received from Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) and sells it to SMUD for delivery to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In return, SMUD pays all of the Carson Project’s costs in acquiring, cleaning and making the gas available to SMUD. The Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement expires in September 2025. In late 2021, the Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, along with the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The Carson Project is currently receiving, processing and selling up to 1,500 Dth/day with provisions for volume increases over time to 2,500 Dth/day. Digester gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations.

In December 2011, SMUD entered into a 20-year agreement with EIF KC Landfill Gas LLC (“EIF”) to purchase up to 7,050 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from multiple landfill projects. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in January 2014. Currently the delivery point is Kern River – Opal and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. Renewable natural gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations. In April 2022, SMUD entered into a transaction to sell the renewable natural gas purchased into the renewable transportation markets. The transaction expires in March 2025. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

AB 2196 is a law that defines the criteria by which existing and future renewable natural gas contracts will qualify for the State RPS program. The CEC adopted a RPS Eligibility Guidebook on April 30, 2013, which includes detailed rules for implementation of AB 2196. SMUD received an updated certificate of eligibility from the CEC in July 2014 for the Cosumnes Power Plant that included the quantities of renewable natural gas from all contracts. The CEC adopted a revised RPS Eligibility Guidebook (Ninth Edition) on April 27, 2017. This latest guidebook did not change the RPS eligibility of any of the above SMUD renewable natural gas and digester gas contracts, but did simplify reporting requirements for these contracts.

Gas Transmission

SMUD has satisfied its obligation to deliver natural gas to its power plants by constructing a natural gas pipeline, purchasing an equity interest in two PG&E backbone gas transmission lines, and contracting for capacity on a number of existing interstate natural gas transmission lines.

The Local Pipeline. SMUD constructed and owns a 20-inch, 50-mile natural gas pipeline in the greater Sacramento area (the “Local Pipeline”) that transports gas to all of the Local Gas-Fired Plants except McClellan. The Local Pipeline is interconnected with PG&E’s major State gas transmission lines 300 and 401. Additionally, it may be interconnected with one or more private gas gathering pipelines located in the area, a gas storage project and/or other FERC approved pipelines that may be built in the local area. In conjunction with the construction of the Cosumnes Power Plant, SMUD extended the Local Pipeline to the plant site. The 26-mile extension was completed in 2004. The extension is 24 inches in diameter and was designed to serve both the Cosumnes Power Plant and an additional second phase, if constructed.

![PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=PG%26E+Backbone+Gas+Transmission+Lines+300+and+401)

**PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401.** In 1996, SMUD purchased an equity interest in PG&E’s backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 (referred to as the PG&E backbone). The total capacity acquired at that time was approximately 85,000 Dth/day and consisted of approximately 43,600 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, Oregon and 44,700 Dth/day from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California. SMUD was also entitled to a share of non-firm capacity, which was approximately 4,360 Dth/day; making the total capacity potentially available to SMUD almost 90,000 Dth/day. This purchase made SMUD a co-owner of the PG&E backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 and obligated SMUD to pay PG&E to operate the pipelines on its behalf subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and operating protocols. PG&E reduced operating pressures on Line 300 after PG&E suffered a natural gas explosion in San Bruno, CA in September of 2010. Operating pressures and capacity may also fluctuate due to regulatory and other changes. As of December 1, 2021, SMUD holds a total capacity of approximately 87,000 Dth/day, consisting of approximately 47,572 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, and 39,193 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California.

**Kern River Gas Transmission Company Long Term Agreement.** SMUD has an agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company for 200,000 Dth/day of firm capacity through April 30, 2028. This capacity gives SMUD access to the Rocky Mountain supply basin at Opal, Wyoming, and connects to PG&E Line 300 (owned in part by SMUD) at Daggett, California.

SMUD’s diversified portfolio of gas transmission arrangements allows for the purchase of gas from a variety of suppliers and locations, and the opportunity to capitalize on regional price differentials where possible. In addition, it ensures diversity in the SMUD/PG&E backbone and enhances the reliability of SMUD’s gas supply.

**Gas Storage**

SMUD also employs gas storage as part of its overall fuel supply strategy. Gas storage is useful in helping to balance gas supply, mitigate market price volatility, and provide a reliable supply to meet peak day delivery requirements.

SMUD has a contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2023 and expires in March 2026, for capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity.

SMUD also has a second contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2022 and expires in March 2024, for additional capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity. SMUD does not plan to renew this contract upon expiration.

SMUD has a contract with Wild Goose Storage LLC, that will begin in April 2024 (but which allows for early injection (December 2023 – March 2024)) for capacity in the Wild Goose Storage project located near Gridley in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 0.2 million Dth of storage inventory, ratcheted (12,500-14,000 Dth/day) volumes of injection rights and ratcheted (10,000 – 24,000 Dth/day) volumes of withdrawal capacity.

# Power Purchase Agreements

SMUD has a number of power purchase agreements to help meet its power requirements. Some of these agreements are described below.

## Western Area Power Administration
Effective January 1, 2005, SMUD entered into a 20-year contract with WAPA. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement extending the term by 30 years for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2054. Power sold under this contract is generated by the Central Valley Project (“CVP”), a series of federal hydroelectric facilities in northern California operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The contract provides WAPA’s CVP Base Resource customers (including SMUD) delivery of a percentage share of project generation in return for reimbursement of an equivalent share of project costs. SMUD’s CVP Base Resource share is roughly 25% of project generation and costs. This is expected to be approximately 318 MW of capacity and 661 GWh of energy in an average water year but will vary depending on precipitation. Energy available under the contract is determined by water releases required for water supply and flood control and is then shaped into higher value periods within other CVP operating constraints. More capacity and energy are typically available in spring and summer months and less in fall and winter.

SMUD also has a contract with WAPA expiring December 31, 2024, by which WAPA delivers an additional 200-300 MW per hour from projects located in the Pacific Northwest based on certain contractual parameters. In 2022, SMUD received 1,913 GWh of energy under this contract. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement for the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2030.

## Avangrid (formerly Iberdrola Renewables (“Iberdrola”))
SMUD has a contract with Iberdrola for 126 GWh of wind power generated in Solano County, California. The SMUD Board approved an extension of the wind contract through June 30, 2025.

## Patua Project LLC
In April 2010, SMUD entered into a power purchase agreement with Patua Project LLC (“Patua”), a subsidiary of Gradient Resources, for the delivery of up to 132 MW (expected to be 120 MW nominal power output) of renewable energy from geothermal generation being developed in north central Nevada, from a Gradient Resources project known as the Patua Project. The Patua Project was to have been developed in three phases. Since 2010, the agreed upon capacity has been reduced several times. In December 2013, Phase 1 of the project, which had been reduced to 30 MW, finally achieved commercial operation. In 2014, the parties concluded negotiations on the fourth amendment to the power purchase agreement with Patua, which reduced the total capacity down to 40 MW, extended the commercial operation date of Phase 2 to January 1, 2016, and allowed Patua to add up to 13 MW of solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production. In addition, this amendment shifted responsibility to Patua for a portion of the long-term transmission service agreements that have been underutilized due to the project not meeting its targets. In November 2015, the Patua Project was acquired by TL Power, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cyrq Energy, Inc. (“Cyrq”). In December 2015, Cyrq terminated Phase 2. Upon termination of Phase 2, the contractual right for Cyrq to add solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production was reduced to 10 MW. As a result of poor performance during the first year of operation, SMUD reduced its obligation to take power from 30 MW to 25 MW. Performance continued to lag in 2015 and 2016 and SMUD further reduced its obligation to take power from 25 MW to 19 MW.

## Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff
In September 2009, SMUD’s Board authorized a feed-in tariff program for the purchase of renewable energy from local renewable energy projects connected to SMUD’s distribution system. SMUD’s Board authorized connection of up to 100 MW under the feed-in tariff which included standard payment rates and standard purchase terms for power. The feed-in tariff program became effective on January 1, 2010. Under the feed-in tariff, SMUD has executed 20-year term power purchase agreements. 

A-36

agreements for solar projects totaling 98.5 MW. Construction and start-up were completed on all projects between 2010 and 2012.

**CalEnergy LLC.** In August 2014, SMUD entered into a 22-year power purchase agreement with CalEnergy LLC for the purchase of 30 MW per year of renewable energy from its Salton Sea geothermal facilities. As of July 1, 2017, SMUD began receiving up to 10 MW from the CalEnergy portfolio, which escalated to the full 30 MWs on May 1, 2020.

**Rancho Seco Solar.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Rancho Seco Solar LLC for the purchase of energy from a 10.88 MW solar PV project sited on SMUD’s property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Commercial operation was achieved in August of 2016. Rancho Seco Solar LLC leased the property from SMUD under a land lease agreement. The output of this project directly serves two large commercial customers that executed agreements with SMUD for retail supply of solar power.

In May 2019, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement for an additional 160 MW solar PV project with Rancho Seco Solar II, LLC. The project is located on SMUD-owned property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, adjacent to the existing 10.88 MW solar PV project. Construction began in 2019, and the project became commercially operable in February 2021.

**Grady Wind Energy.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Grady Wind Energy LLC (“Grady”) for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW wind project located in New Mexico (the “Grady Project”). The Grady Project began commercial operations on August 5, 2019. Energy from the Grady Project is delivered to CAISO. SMUD purchases 100% of the Grady Project output, which includes energy, renewable energy credits, and capacity attributes.

**Great Valley Solar 2, LLC.** In January 2017, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Great Valley Solar 2, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 60 MW solar PV project located in Fresno County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was December 28, 2017.

**ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC.** On September 14, 2016, Senate Bill 859 (“SB 859”) was signed into law. Under SB 859, a POU must procure its proportionate share of 125 MW of renewable energy from biomass plants burning high hazard forest fuels, subject to terms of at least five years. Seven POUs (SMUD, MID, Turlock Irrigation District (“TID”), Anaheim Public Utilities, Imperial Irrigation District, Los Angeles Department of Water & Power and Riverside Public Utilities, collectively described herein as the “ARP-Loyalton POUs”) jointly solicited proposals for up to 29 MW of contract capacity for renewable energy to meet the requirements of SB 859. In January 2018, SMUD entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC to fulfill 18 MW of the required 29 MW with SMUD’s share being just over 23 percent (the “ARP-Loyalton PPA”). See “—Roseburg Forest Products Co.” below for a discussion of the remaining SB 859 capacity. The contract became effective on April 1, 2018. On February 18, 2020, ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and stopped producing and selling energy from the biomass plant. On May 7, 2022, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the Loyalton facility to Sierra Valley Enterprises, LLC (“SVE”). SVE initially expressed interest in bringing the facility back into service; however, the bankruptcy trustee requested requested extension of the deadline for SVE to accept or reject the ARP-Loyalton PPA. The latest deadline was April 19, 2023, the date of expiration of the ARP-Loyalton PPA terms. SVE did not resume operations before the end of the ARP-Loyalton PPA term, the ARP-Loyalton POUs have negotiated a settlement agreement with the bankruptcy trustee (the “ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement”). The ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement, which SMUD executed and is filed with the court, defines funds from the performance security that the ARP-Loyalton POUs will keep to cover legal and administrative fees, along with a contingency amount to cover potential risk of future damages. Since the ARP-Loyalton POUs entered into a five-year agreement to

procure compliant biomass and provided SVE the opportunity to accept the ARP-Loyalton PPA and restart operations, the ARP-Loyalton POUs consider their statutory obligations to have been fulfilled.

**Roseburg Forest Products Co.** For the remaining SB 859 biomass obligation of 11 MW, SMUD and the other ARP-Loyalton POUs have entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with Roseburg Forest Products Co. SMUD’s share of the contract capacity is 2.5795 MW, and the plant began operating under the contract on February 26, 2021.

**Sutter Energy Center.** SMUD entered into an initial two-year contract (with a third-year exercisable option) with Calpine Energy Services, L.P. (“Calpine”) for the ability to schedule up to 258 MW of energy from Sutter Energy Center. The Sutter Energy Center is a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle facility located in Yuba City, California. The initial contract became effective on April 1, 2018. SMUD exercised its option to extend the contract, which expired November 1, 2020. SMUD entered into a new contract with Calpine for the same 258 MW of energy that became effective January 1, 2021, and had an original expiration date of January 1, 2024. In December 2021, SMUD extended this contract through December 31, 2026.

**Drew Solar, LLC.** In June 2018, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Drew Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 100 MW solar PV project located in Imperial County, California. The project’s scheduled commercial operation date was set to be December 31, 2021. The commercial operation date was delayed due to Force Majeure claims surrounding the COVID pandemic and supply chain constraints caused by changes in Federal regulatory requirements. The project began commercially operating on November 3, 2022.

**Wildflower Solar I, LLC.** In October 2018, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Wildflower Solar I, LLC, for the purchase of energy, capacity, and RECs from a 13 MW solar PV project located in Rio Linda, California. The project began commercially operating on December 18, 2020.

**Coyote Creek (Formerly Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC.)** In August 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW solar PV and 100 MW four-hour Battery Energy Storage System (“BESS”) capacity project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but has been delayed to 2026 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

**SloughHouse Solar, LLC.** In September 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with SloughHouse Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 50 MW solar PV project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but the commercial operation date has been delayed to March 31, 2025 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

# Transmission Service Agreements

## TANC California-Oregon Transmission Project
The 340-mile COTP is one part of a three 500-kV line coordinated system known as the California-Oregon Intertie (“COI”). The COTP is allocated one-third of the 4,800 MW capability of the COI system (see related agreements below). TANC is entitled to 1,390 MW and is obligated to pay approximately 80% of the operating costs of the COTP. SMUD is a member of TANC and a party to Project Agreement No. 3 (“PA3”), under which it is entitled to 378 MW and obligated to pay on an unconditional take-or-pay basis about 27.5% of TANC’s COTP debt service and operations costs, subject to a “step-up” obligation of up to 25% of its entitlement share upon the unremedied default of another TANC member-participant. In 2009, SMUD entered into a long-term layoff agreement with certain members that increased SMUD’s entitlement by 35 MW. In 2014, SMUD entered into another long-term layoff agreement with certain other members that increased SMUD’s COTP entitlements by 128 MW and amended the 2009 layoff agreement that returned 13 MW to a member. In January 2024, SMUD entered into an agreement to extend the 2009 long-term layoff agreement with certain members to January 31, 2034. As of January 31, 2024, SMUD was entitled to approximately 528 MW of TANC’s transfer capability for imports and 405 MW for exports, and is obligated to pay approximately 38.6% of TANC’s COTP debt service and operations costs. SMUD’s payments under this contract, like SMUD’s payments under its other power purchase and transmission service agreements, are treated as “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under resolutions securing the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the section “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below). SMUD relies on its COTP rights to purchase power, access contingency reserves through the Western Power Pool, and obtain renewable resources to supplement its own resources to serve its load. TANC maintains a contingency reserve and a payment/casualty insurance program. TANC’s budget for COTP costs, support services and advocacy expenses is about $45.4 million for 2023. SMUD’s obligation on the TANC budget is about $17.5 million for 2023.

## TANC Tesla-Midway Transmission Service
TANC has a long-term contract with PG&E to provide TANC with 300 MW of transmission service between PG&E’s Midway Substation and the electric systems of the TANC Members (the “Tesla-Midway Service”). SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service had been 46 MW. As part of the 2009 long-term layoff agreement, SMUD acquired an additional 2 MW of South-of-Tesla Principles (“SOTP”) transmission rights for 15 years starting February, 2009 from another TANC member, bringing SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service to 48 MW.

## Bonneville Power Administration
In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration (“BPA”) for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service from BPA’s Hilltop substation in northeastern California to the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua geothermal project over BPA’s 230kV transmission lines. In early 2013, in accordance with BPA’s transmission tariff, the transmission service was split into two 30 MW services and deferred as appropriate to better fit the timing of expected commercial operation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Patua Project LLC.” SMUD submitted another request for the 30 MW of transmission procured for Phase 2 of the Patua Project to split the service into a 10 MW and a 20 MW service, with the 10 MW service deferred and timed with the originally expected commercial operation date of Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 1 of the Patua Project and SMUD’s reduced obligation due to the poor performance of Phase 1 of the Patua Project, much of the transmission reserved for it will no longer be needed. BPA does not have a provision in its transmission tariff for early termination of transmission service. However, the power purchase agreement with Patua requires Patua to cover unused transmission that SMUD has procured for the Patua purchases. On January 1, 2020, SMUD’s transmission rights with BPA were reduced to 19 MW. This now aligns with SMUD’s Pacificorp transmission rights of 19 MW described in the immediately following paragraph.

**PacifiCorp.** In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with PacifiCorp for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service across PacifiCorp’s high voltage step-up transformer at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In early 2013, in accordance with PacifiCorp’s transmission tariff, the commencement of the 60 MW of transmission service was deferred to fit the timing of first deliveries expected from the 30 MW of Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In 2013, SMUD terminated the 60 MW of transmission service and requested two new transmission services of 30 MW each, with service start dates timed to better fit with the expected start dates of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the reduction in expected output of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the second 30 MW transmission agreement, and replaced it with a 10 MW transmission service agreement for Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 2 of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the 10 MW PacifiCorp transmission service agreement and as a result of the reduced obligation to take power from the Patua Project, SMUD has reduced its remaining PacifiCorp transmission service from 30 MW to 19 MW.

**Western Area Power Administration.** SMUD does not have a direct interconnection of its power system to the COTP. To receive power deliveries that use its COTP rights, SMUD has a long-term transmission service agreement with WAPA for transmission of 342 MW of power from the COTP line (received at WAPA’s Tracy or Olinda substations) to SMUD’s system. In May of 2011, WAPA completed the Sacramento Voltage Support Transmission Project. Completion of this project has given SMUD an additional 165 MW of transmission service rights on WAPA’s system from the COTP at the Olinda Substation to SMUD’s system at the Elverta Substation.

**Projected Resources**

The following tables titled “Projected Requirements and Resources to Meet Load Requirements Energy Requirements and Resources” (the “Energy Table”) and “Capacity Requirements and Resources Net Capacity – Megawatts” (the “Capacity Table”) describe SMUD’s contracted commitments and owned resources available to meet its forecasted load requirements through the year 2033. Resources are shown on an annualized basis with market purchases net against surplus sales to arrive at a single net position for each year. Because SMUD’s available resources do not exactly match its actual load requirements on an hourly basis, there are times during a year when resources available will either exceed or be insufficient to meet SMUD’s needs. Expected actual capacity values are included in the tables. These values may differ from measured net demonstrated capacity values of the Local Area Gas-Fired Plants. The table below also includes the impact energy efficiency has on resources requirements as discussed below under “Demand Side Management Programs.” See “BUSINESS STRATEGY” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.”

Resources listed in both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table are listed as either renewable or non-renewable. Generally, SMUD follows the CEC guidelines for eligibility requirements. Some of SMUD’s renewable resources listed include solar, wind, geothermal, small hydroelectric facilities with a capacity of 30 MW or less, and biomass (representing generation from a fuel comprised of agricultural wastes and residues, landscape and tree trimmings, wood and wood waste).

As in any forecast, assumptions are made. In both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table the WAPA and UARP forecasts assume average water conditions throughout the period. On the capacity table, WAPA and Cosumnes Power Plant renewable capacity is estimated based on the ratio of renewable energy to total WAPA or Cosumnes Power Plant energy. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric.”

A-40
<!-- Page 494 -->
The Uncommitted Purchases (Sales) on the tables represent either anticipated future needs or surpluses. Future needs are met well in advance of delivery. They also include both renewable and non-renewable resources.

The Transmission Losses represent reductions in the amount of energy or capacity from the location it was purchased to the point of entering SMUD’s electrical system. This amount reduces the Total Resources available to meet the Total Projected Energy Requirements of the electrical system.

## Demand Side Management Programs

SMUD’s demand-side management initiatives represent an integral element of its total resource portfolio, and are organized into two major components: energy efficiency and load management programs. Energy efficiency offerings include a wide variety of programs and services to customers to retrofit or upgrade existing equipment and fixtures and to install new energy efficiency measures in existing and new construction facilities. Load management allows SMUD to reduce the load on the electric system by cycling residential air conditioning, and calling upon commercial/industrial customers to curtail energy usage when energy is constrained during the summer or system emergencies. Load management programs are projected to allow SMUD to shed approximately 60 MW of peak load in an emergency on a hot day, representing about 2% of SMUD’s maximum system peak demand.

The customer “smart meter” system with 2-way communication capability provides information regarding customer usage patterns, which is expected to help SMUD tailor rate designs that provide customers with both the information and ability to manage their energy usage around high energy cost periods.

# Balancing Authority Area Agreements

## Background
SMUD began operating as an independent control area, later termed a Balancing Authority, on June 18, 2002 within the WECC reliability organization’s region. This reduced SMUD’s exposure to the costs and reliability risks of the CAISO’s markets. SMUD expanded its operational footprint beyond SMUD’s service territory to include WAPA’s electric system, including the MID, Roseville, and Redding service areas (on January 1, 2005) and the COTP (on December 1, 2005). As described further below, SMUD ceased to be the Balancing Authority on April 30, 2011, as BANC took SMUD’s place as the Balancing Authority. SMUD remains the operator of the Balancing Authority through a contract with BANC. SMUD administers the contracts with WAPA and TANC to provide specified Balancing Authority-related and other services, and is compensated by WAPA and TANC. TANC recovers such Balancing Authority services costs as a part of its annual operating budget from the COTP Participants and WAPA recovers its Balancing Authority services costs through its rates for power and transmission service. The agreement with WAPA, among other terms, establishes operating procedures and reserve obligations between the parties and terminates on December 31, 2024. BANC, SMUD and WAPA will develop successor agreements in 2024 to take effect upon expiration of the existing contract. WAPA in turn has agreements with electric systems connected to it to assure that such systems also operate reliably (i.e., MID, Roseville and Redding). As a result of the transition to BANC as the Balancing Authority, SMUD assigned or terminated its interconnection and operations agreements with other connecting Balancing Authority areas (i.e., CAISO, BPA and TID). BANC is now the party to these agreements as they primarily address only Balancing Authority matters required for compliance with the reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”), such as emergency assistance arrangements. See also “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY” – Western Energy Imbalance Market.”

## Reliability Standards
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC authority to enforce reliability standards for the bulk electric system. In June 2007, these standards became mandatory for SMUD and BANC.

In 2022, SMUD and BANC underwent a combined NERC/WECC audit to evaluate compliance with applicable reliability standards. These audits occur every three years. At the conclusion of the audit, regulators determined that neither entity had any compliance violations related to the Operations and Planning or Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards. SMUD and BANC will undergo another NERC/WECC audit sometime in 2025.

## Balancing Authority of Northern California
SMUD, MID, Redding and Roseville executed a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (the “BANC JPA Agreement”) creating BANC on May 8, 2009. BANC became operational on May 1, 2011 as a Balancing Authority and replaced SMUD as the entity responsible for Balancing Authority-related reliability standards. Since that time, the Trinity Public Utilities District and the City of Shasta Lake have also become members of BANC. As provided in the BANC member agreement, liability for penalties associated with such Balancing Authority-related reliability standards are shared on a pro rata basis among the members of BANC. SMUD is the Balancing Authority operator under contract and performs Balancing Authority operational functions on behalf of BANC, much as it did when it was the Balancing Authority. The BANC JPA Agreement assigns cost responsibility based on member load within the BANC Balancing Authority, with SMUD representing approximately 70% of the total load.

## Power Pool and Other Agreements

### Western Power Pool Agreement
The Western Power Pool (“WPP”) is an agreement among over 30 utilities and public agencies in the western United States to coordinate contingency reserve sharing.
<!-- Page 498 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

referred to as the WPP Reserve Sharing Program (“RSP”). The RSP permits participants to rely on one another in the event that any participant experiences a generating resource outage. While SMUD became an RSP participant in 2009, participation is limited to Balancing Authorities, which SMUD relinquished to BANC in 2011. Under the RSP, BANC and TID (also a WPP member) share their reserve amounts and when necessary and when sufficient unused COTP rights and capacity are available, may call upon WPP reserves from the RSP member systems in the Pacific Northwest. The WPP RSP permits members to operate more efficiently by reducing the contingency reserves that they would otherwise need to have available if they could not rely on each other.

**TANC-SMUD OASIS Administration Agreement.** SMUD entered into an agreement with TANC to provide OASIS services (transmission sales and scheduling related services in the BANC BA of TANC members’ COTP rights) on September 29, 2005. SMUD is compensated for performing these services. TANC and SMUD entered into a letter agreement dated October 25, 2010 to clarify each party’s role for regulatory reliability standards compliance responsibilities and take into account SMUD’s increased efforts related to supporting TANC’s compliance requirements. SMUD and TANC entered into an agreement to transition this service to the Western Area Power Administration, effective on May 1, 2023. Going forward SMUD will only have a minor role in receiving payments and distributing revenues to the TANC members.

**Other Interconnection Agreements**

**Background.** SMUD’s electric system was originally purchased from PG&E in 1947. SMUD’s service area is mostly surrounded by PG&E’s and WAPA’s service areas. The SMUD and PG&E electric systems are interconnected at SMUD’s Rancho Seco and Lake 230-kV substations. SMUD and WAPA are interconnected at SMUD’s Hurley, Elverta, Natomas and Folsom 230-kV substations.

**PG&E Interconnection Agreement.** PG&E and SMUD executed a Replacement Interconnection Agreement (“RIA”) which became effective on January 1, 2010. The RIA provides that SMUD and PG&E operate their interconnections reliably, plan their electric systems to meet their load requirements, and avoid or mitigate impacts they cause by certain electric system modifications. The agreement has a termination date of December 31, 2024, subject to FERC approval. SMUD and other Northern California utilities have similar interconnection agreements with PG&E, albeit with different expiration dates. PG&E filed a successor interconnection agreement with one of these utilities, TID, on November 1, 2023, to become effective on January 1, 2024. Many interconnection customers, including SMUD, intervened and submitted comments or protests in the FERC docket. FERC accepted the filing and TID and PG&E are now in a settlement process, pending litigation of the parties cannot resolve the disputed items. SMUD anticipates that PG&E will seek to negotiate a successor interconnection agreement with SMUD which will be informed by the TID settlement or litigation process. While some functional mechanisms in the interconnection agreement may change, SMUD expects that its successor interconnection agreement will substantially preserve the balance of burdens and benefits consistent with FERC’s standard of requiring rates and terms of service that are just and reasonable. SMUD expects this process to be completed by the current expiration date of the RIA.

**PG&E Generator Interconnection Agreements.** SMUD signed a LGIA with CAISO and PG&E for the Solano 3 Wind Project, effective December 16, 2008, with a 50-year term. The Solano 2 Wind Project has interconnection rights granted through a LGIA, also with the CAISO and PG&E. The agreement became effective in January 2010 and has a term of 20 years. On June 3, 2021, SMUD entered into a LGIA with the CAISO and PG&E, for the planned 90.8 MW Solano 4 Wind project with a 10-year term and automatic renewal for successive one-year terms thereafter. On February 27, 2023, SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process which combines the Solano 2, 3 & 4 projects into one Solano Wind Project. The original agreement conditions for the individual projects are carried forward with

# Management’s Discussion of SMUD’s Operating Results

## Year Ended December 31, 2023
For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $218.1 million as compared to an increase of $70.7 million for 2022.

Operating revenues were $228.5 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower sales of surplus gas ($118.3 million), transfers to the RSF ($67.2 million), sales to customers ($28.3 million), transfers from the RSF ($21.9 million), and LCFS revenue ($3.9 million), partially offset by higher sales of surplus power ($136.6 million), AB 32 revenue ($3.7 million), customer fees ($1.1 million), and lower transmission revenue ($2.3 million).

Operating expenses were $292.8 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower purchased power expenses ($175.5 million), production operating expenses ($146.4 million), depreciation expenses ($22.7 million), production maintenance expenses ($12.3 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($7.2 million), partially offset by higher administrative and general expenses ($33.4 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($15.8 million), public good expenses ($8.8 million), and customer service and information expenses ($6.6 million).

Non-Operating income increased by $55.2 million primarily due to fair market value assessment and gain on sale of land ($33.3 million), higher interest income ($21.7 million), higher unrealized holding gains ($11.4 million), higher CCA revenue ($5.7 million), partially offset by lower investment income ($39.1 million).

Interest expense decreased $27.9 million from 2022.

## Year Ended December 31, 2022
For the year ended December 31, 2022, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $70.7 million as compared to an increase of $347.3 million for 2021.

Operating revenues were $363.0 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher sales to customers ($130.7 million), sales of surplus gas ($96.0 million), sales of surplus power ($62.2 million), transfers to the RSF ($28.9 million), transfers from the RSF ($24.3 million), customer fees ($9.5 million), AB 32 revenue ($4.9 million) and LCFS revenue ($2.2 million), partially offset by lower gain on sale of carbon allowance futures ($3.7 million).

Operating expenses were $601.2 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher purchased power expenses ($263.6 million), amortization of pension and OPEB ($126.9 million), production operating expenses ($125.1 million), depreciation expenses ($49.5 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($22.1 million), production maintenance expenses ($18.4 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($8.1 million), public good expenses ($7.4 million), and customer service and information expenses ($4.5 million), partially offset by lower administrative and general expenses ($27.4 million).

Non-Operating income decreased by $19.0 million primarily due to lower grant revenue ($39.6 million), unrealized holding losses ($3.7 million), partially offset by higher investment income ($19.7 million), closeout of escrow account ($2.8 million), and loss on asset retirements ($1.9 million).

Interest expense increased $19.5 million from 2021.

## Regulatory Assets
In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” SMUD defers, as regulatory assets, certain types of expenditures. These assets are amortized and collected through future rates.

As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had a total of $916.1 million recorded for regulatory assets. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 68 which requires SMUD to record a net pension liability was $323.5 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 68 was $174.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 75 which requires SMUD to record a net Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) liability was $268.2 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 75 was $39.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with Rancho Seco decommissioning costs totaled $108.0 million at December 31, 2023. Nuclear fuel storage costs and non-radiological decommissioning costs have been collected in rates since 2009. For a complete description of these regulatory assets, see Note 8 (Regulatory Deferrals) to SMUD’s financial statements.

The Board has authorized the deferral of any charges or credits that result from the change in valuation of ineffective hedges that should be reported as Investment Revenue/Expense on the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and changes in net position. The Board’s resolution establishes that such charges or credits are not included in rates based on market value changes but are included in rates when the underlying transactions occur. Therefore, under GASB No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” any such changes are included in the Statement of Net Position as regulatory assets or liabilities. For a complete description of these derivative financial instruments, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s financial statements.

**RANCHO SECO DECOMMISSIONING**

**Overview.** The 913 MW Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant (“Rancho Seco”) began operation in 1970 and was licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”). In June 1989, the NRC issued a notice of violation against allowing SMUD to continue to operate Rancho Seco as a nuclear generating facility, and the plant was shut down. In 1991, SMUD submitted a report (the “Financial Assurance Plan”) providing financial assurance to the NRC that SMUD will have sufficient funds available to pay for the cost of decommissioning. On March 17, 1992, the NRC granted SMUD a change from operating to a possession-only license for Rancho Seco that relieved SMUD from compliance with a number of NRC regulations applicable to operating nuclear power plants. SMUD also filed a proposed decommissioning plan with the NRC (the “Decommissioning Plan”), which was approved in March 1995.

After the decommissioning efforts began, no suitable disposal option was available to SMUD for the Class B and Class C low level radioactive waste generated during the plant decommissioning. With the used nuclear fuel stored onsite requiring oversight staff, SMUD opted to store the Class B and Class C radioactive waste in an existing interim onsite storage building until a suitable disposal option was available. In November 2007, the possession-only license for Rancho Seco was amended to update the Decommissioning Plan to terminate the possession-only license for the Class B and Class C waste in two phases. Phase I of the decommissioning was completed at the end of 2008. Following verification of the site conditions, SMUD submitted a request to the NRC to reduce the licensed facility from 2,480 acres to the interim onsite storage building and about one acre surrounding it. The request was approved by the NRC in September 2009. Phase II of decommissioning included the approximately two-acre interim storage building containing the Class B and Class C radioactive waste and surrounding area. In September 2013, SMUD entered into a contract with the operator of the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility located in Andrews, Texas. Shipment of the Class B and Class C radioactive waste for disposal was completed in November 2014. SMUD conducted additional clean-up activities and radiological surveys, which were followed by NRC confirmatory surveys. The results of these surveys demonstrated unit dose criteria well below NRC release criteria, and the NRC approved the Phase II area for unrestricted use. On September 21, 2017, SMUD formally requested the termination of the possession-only license. On August A-51

31, 2018, the NRC officially terminated SMUD’s possession-only license for the remaining Class B and Class C waste at Rancho Seco.

As part of the Decommissioning Plan, the nuclear fuel and Greater Than Class C (“GTCC”) radioactive waste is being stored in a dry storage facility (the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation or “ISFSI”) constructed by SMUD, adjacent to the former reactor facility. The NRC has separately licensed this facility. The DOE, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, is responsible for permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel and GTCC radioactive waste. SMUD has a contract with the DOE for the removal and disposal of this waste. The DOE was to have a waste repository operating by 1998, but has experienced significant and ongoing delays. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act designates Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the final and exclusive repository for the nation’s used nuclear fuel. The DOE discontinued the Yucca Mountain license review activities in 2010, but after a court ordered the NRC to resume its review in 2013, the NRC published its final safety evaluation report in 2015. The final safety report, and the final environmental impact statement, concluded that the proposed repository would be safe and environmentally sound for one million years.

Nevertheless, seeking alternatives to Yucca Mountain, the Blue-Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future delivered its final report in January 2012 with several recommendations. The DOE responded to the recommendations by issuing a report in January 2013 (Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste). Key to both documents is a focus on used fuel from decommissioned sites including Rancho Seco. The DOE report accepts most of the Blue-Ribbon Commission recommendations, and contains timelines for fuel management options which proposed removing the fuel from Rancho Seco as early as 2021. However, any progress on the strategies proposed by the DOE is dependent on legislative action by Congress. With no legislative action taken to this time when the DOE will fulfill its contractual obligations to remove the nuclear fuel and GTCC waste from the Rancho Seco facility. In the meantime, SMUD continues to incur costs of approximately $5 to $7 million per year for storage of used nuclear fuel at the ISFSI. SMUD has filed a series of successful lawsuits against the federal government for recovery of past spent fuel costs. SMUD last recovered over $14 million in 2023. SMUD plans to continue pursuing cost recovery claims to ensure it is reimbursed for all such costs in the future. The ISFSI will be decommissioned, and its license terminated after the fuel and GTCC is removed.

Financial Assurance Plan. In accordance with the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD established and funded an external decommissioning trust fund currently held by Computershare Corporate Trust (the “Decommissioning Trust Fund”). Pursuant to the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD made the final deposit into the Decommissioning Trust Fund in 2008. Additional deposits are not expected but will be made if increased cost estimates or reduced fund interest earnings require it. In 2011, the NRC began requiring that SMUD demonstrate financial assurance for decommissioning the ISFSI as well as the former power facility, increasing the overall cost for decommissioning Rancho Seco. The estimated total cost for decommissioning the ISFSI was approximately $7.1 million on December 31, 2023. The decommissioning cost estimate is required to be updated every three years. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the Decommissioning Trust Fund was $9.4 million, excluding unrealized gains and losses. Based on the current decommissioning cost estimate and the value of the fund, SMUD’s existing Decommissioning Trust Fund provides sufficient funds to complete decommissioning and terminate the ISFSI license.

In addition to these costs, SMUD also estimates that it would cost approximately $13.1 million to restore the site to make it available for other SMUD uses with some major structures remaining intact. Site restoration is not a legal requirement. No site restoration is currently underway.

# EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

SMUD has approximately 2,334 employees, most of whom are covered by a civil service system. SMUD is a contracting member of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“PERS”). Approximately 50% of SMUD’s work-force is represented as to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment, by one of three recognized employee organizations, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) Local 1245, the Organization of SMUD Employees (“OSE”), and the SMUD Public Safety Officers’ Association (“PSOA”). The remaining 50% of SMUD’s workforce, which includes managers, professional, administrative, supervisory, confidential and security staff, is unrepresented.

SMUD negotiated a four-year Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with IBEW and the OSE, effective January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2025. Both contracts contain a no-strike/no-lockout clause effective during the life of the agreements. SMUD has an MOU with PSOA effective through December 31, 2026. SMUD has experienced only one labor interruption, which occurred in January 1980 that lasted four days.

# RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POST-EMPLOYMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

## Pension Plans

SMUD participates in PERS, an agent multiple-employer public employee defined benefit plan. PERS provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. PERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State. Benefit provisions are established by State statute and SMUD policies. The pension plan provides retirement benefits, survivor benefits, and death and disability benefits based upon employees’ years of credited service, age, and final compensation.

As of June 30, 2022, the last actuarial valuation date for SMUD’s plan within PERS, the market value of the SMUD plan assets was $2.32 billion. The plan is 87.8% funded on a market value of assets basis, a decrease of 12.3% compared to the June 30, 2021 funded status based on the market value of assets.

As an employer, SMUD is required to contribute a percentage of payroll each year to PERS to fund SMUD’s plan based on actuarial valuations performed by PERS. PERS collects the normal cost based on a percentage of payroll and the unfunded liability portion is based on a dollar amount. SMUD also makes partial contributions required of SMUD employees on their behalf and for their account. At the PERS fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, SMUD’s required employer contribution rate for normal cost was 9.8% of payroll and the unfunded liability contribution was $22.4 million. During 2023, SMUD contributed $37.4 million to PERS (including SMUD’s contributions to cover required employee contributions), and SMUD employees paid $18.3 million for their share of the PERS contribution.

For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025, SMUD is required to contribute 9.6% and 9.5% of payroll for normal costs and $10.7 million for fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 for the unfunded liability contribution. There is no estimated employer contribution to the unfunded liability for fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Assuming no amendments to the plan and no liability gains or losses (which can have a significant impact), PERS has projected that SMUD will be required to contribute 9.4% of payroll to the plan for normal costs and $15.7 million for the unfunded liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions. The amount SMUD is required to contribute to PERS is expected to increase in the future. The actual amount of such increases
<!-- Page 507 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+displayed)

SMUD has the option to prepare an annual lump sum payment to PERS for the unfunded accrued liability portion only (not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions). SMUD made an annual lump sum prepayment of $19.5 million, and also voluntarily made an additional payment of $47.3 million, for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. SMUD was not required to make an annual lump sum prepayment and, to date, has not voluntarily made additional payments for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

While SMUD has some ability to adjust the retirement benefits provided to its employees, PERS determines the actuarial methods and assumptions used with respect to assets administered by PERS (including the SMUD plan assets) and makes the investment decisions with respect to such assets. For a description of such actuarial methods and assumptions (including the smoothing conventions used by PERS when setting employer contribution rates) and investments, see the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS (SMUD’s plan is part of the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund of PERS) available on its website at www.calpers.ca.gov. SMUD cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information and neither the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS nor any other information contained on the PERS website is incorporated by reference in or part of this Official Statement. Actuarial assessments are “forward-looking” information that reflect the judgment of the fiduciaries of the pension plans, and are based upon a variety of assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be inaccurate or be changed in the future. Actuarial assessments will change with the future experience of the pension plans.

GASB issued Statement No. 68 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – An Amendment of GASB Statement No. 27” (“GASB No. 68”). The primary objective of GASB No. 68 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for pensions. Under GASB No. 68, SMUD is required to report the net pension asset or net pension liability (i.e., the difference between the total pension liability and the pension plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of investment gains and losses. GASB No. 68 separates financial reporting from funding requirements for pension plans. The pension liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is $259.0 million and $235.5 million, respectively.

SMUD provides its employees with two cash deferred compensation plans: one pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 401(k) (the “401(k) Plan”) and one pursuant to IRC Section 457 (the “457 Plan” and collectively, the “Plans”). The Plans are contributory plans in which SMUD’s employees contribute the funds. Each of SMUD’s eligible full-time or permanent part-time employees may participate in either or both Plans, and amounts contributed by employees are vested immediately. Such funds are held by a trustee in trust for the employees upon retirement from SMUD service and, accordingly, are not subject to the general claims of SMUD’s creditors. SMUD makes annual contributions to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of certain employees pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with both of its collective bargaining units. SMUD matches the non-represented employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to a set amount. SMUD also makes limited discretionary contributions to non-represented employees hired after January 1, 2013, which contributions fully vest after five years. Prior to 2022, SMUD did not match employee contributions, nor make contributions on behalf of its employees to the 457 Plan. Beginning in 2022, SMUD makes annual contributions to the 457 Plan on behalf of certain employees and matches employee contributions up to a set amount pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with one of its collective bargaining units. SMUD made contributions to both Plans of $6.9 million in 2023 and to the 401(k) Plan of $7.0 million in 2022. Participating employees made contributions into both Plans totaling $34.3 million in 2023 and $32.4 million in 2022.

![Other Post-Employment Benefits](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Other+Post-Employment+Benefits)

**Other Post-Employment Benefits**

SMUD provides post-employment healthcare benefits, in accordance with SMUD policy and negotiated agreements with employee representation groups in a single employer defined benefit plan, to all employees who retire from SMUD, and their dependents. SMUD also provides post-employment healthcare benefits to covered employees who are eligible for disability retirement. SMUD contributes the full cost of coverage for retirees hired before January 1, 1991, and a portion of the cost based on credited years of service for retirees hired after January 1, 1991. SMUD also contributes a portion of the costs of coverage for these retirees’ dependents. Retirees are required to contribute the portion that is not paid by SMUD. The benefits, benefit levels, retiree contributions and employer contributions are governed by SMUD and can be amended by SMUD through its personnel manual and union contracts.

SMUD’s post-employment health care benefits are funded through the PERS California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (“CERBT”), an agent multiple-employer plan. The funding of a plan occurs when the following events take place: the employer makes payments of benefits directly to or on behalf of a retiree or beneficiary; the employer makes premium payments to an insurer; or the employer irrevocably transfers assets to a trust or other third party acting in the role of trustee, where the plan assets are dedicated to the sole purpose of the payments of the plan benefits, and creditors of the government do not have access to those assets.

SMUD has elected to contribute the normal costs to the CERBT but annually receive reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT. In 2024, SMUD’s contribution for the normal costs to CERBT is $10.6 million. In 2023, SMUD made a contribution to the CERBT for normal costs in the amount of $8.6 million. In 2022, SMUD decided to forgo making a contribution for the normal costs to the CERBT because there was a net OPEB asset as of December 31, 2021. SMUD made additional contributions to the trust. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD made healthcare benefit contributions by paying actual medical costs of $24.7 million and $24.5 million, respectively. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD received $24.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively, reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT.

At June 30, 2023 and 2022, SMUD estimated that the actuarially determined accumulated post-employment benefit obligation was approximately $403.6 and $381.7 million, respectively. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the plan was 92.3% and 97.9% funded, respectively.

SMUD’s actuary uses PERS economic and other assumptions as the basis for the calculation of the post-employment benefit obligation. The actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will vary substantially if such PERS assumptions, such as interest rate and life expectancy, among others, prove to be inaccurate or different than SMUD’s actual experience. Although SMUD believes that such assumptions and estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that any such assumptions will prove to be accurate, or that SMUD’s actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will not materially exceed its estimates. Additional information is available in Note 15 (Other Postemployment Benefits) and “Required Supplementary Information” to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

GASB previously issued SGAS No. 75 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions”. The primary objective of GASB No. 75 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for post-employment benefits other than pensions (“OPEB”). Under GASB No. 75, SMUD is required to report the net OPEB asset or net OPEB liability (i.e., the difference between the total OPEB liability and the OPEB plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of

**Outstanding Indebtedness**

**General.** SMUD typically finances its capital requirements through the sale of revenue bonds, the sale of commercial paper, from draws on its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and from internally generated funds. With the enactment of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2024 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, SMUD is monitoring and exploring new methods of financing, including those afforded under these two federal laws, that provide not-for-profit public power utilities with direct federal incentive payments.

SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Senior Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 (the “Senior Resolution”) adopted in 1971, as amended and supplemented (the “Senior Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Senior Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $1,783,965,000 outstanding. The Senior Bonds are payable solely from the Net Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Senior Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of “Maintenance and Operation Costs” and “Energy Payments” as defined in the Senior Resolution, including payments by SMUD to TANC under PA3, payments by SMUD under power purchase agreements related to the Authorities and payments by SMUD to NCGA and NCEA under their respective gas supply contracts. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD’s Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the “Subordinated Resolution”).
<!-- Page 510 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

“Subordinate Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Subordinated Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds.

SMUD issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of March 21, 2024, SMUD’s Notes were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes (and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit) are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD also entered into a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank and issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes thereunder (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in February 2022. As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future. SMUD’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

Joint Powers Authorities. SMUD has entered into long-term take-or-pay purchase agreements with SFA relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Under such agreements, SMUD has exclusive control of the dispatch of all five of the Local Gas-Fired Plants and takes all of the power produced by the Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” The Authorities are each treated as component units of SMUD for accounting purposes. Only SFA has outstanding debt, which relates solely to the Cosumnes Power Plant and is payable solely from capacity payments made by SMUD under the related power purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2023, bonds issued by SFA to finance the Cosumnes Power Plant were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $87,890,000. SMUD’s payments under the power purchase agreements relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal of and interest on the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the
<!-- Page 511 -->
![NCGA bonds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=NCGA+bonds)

NCGA bonds. As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $120,070,000 remain outstanding.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCEA as a joint powers authority. NCEA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCEA issued $539,615,000 in bonds in December 2018 for the purpose of paying J. Aron & Company LLC in advance for natural gas or electricity to be delivered to NCEA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas or electricity supplies delivered by NCEA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the NCEA bonds. [As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $537,295,000 remain outstanding. As described in the forepart of this Official Statement, the bonds issued by NCEA in 2018 are expected to be refunded with proceeds of the Bonds (as defined in the forepart of this Official Statement.)] [to be revised for 2024 Senior Bond offering documents]

**Interest Rate Swap Agreements.** SMUD has two interest rate swap agreements relating to previously or currently outstanding Subordinated Bonds, as shown in the following table. For more information, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

| Effective Date | Termination Date | SMUD Pays | SMUD Receives | Notional Amount (000's) | Counterparty |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 7/2/1997       | 7/1/2024         | Floating  | SIFMA          | 5.154%                  | $19,570      | J Aron & Company LLC |
| 07/12/2023     | 08/15/2041       | Fixed     | 0.718% [70% of 1M SOFR] | 132,020                | Barclays Bank |

The obligations of SMUD under the swap agreements are not secured by a pledge of revenues of SMUD’s electric system or any other property of SMUD. SMUD does not currently have any collateral posting requirements with respect to the interest rate swap agreements, but SMUD may be required to post collateral under certain circumstances.

**Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments.** SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”) and Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series W (the “2010 Series W Bonds”) were issued as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. At the time the 2009 Series V Bonds and 2010 Series W Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive an annual cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. However, as a result of the federal budget process, many payments from the federal government, including Build America Bonds subsidy payments, have been reduced. Absent the federal budget reductions, the aggregate annual cash subsidy payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds would be approximately $9.8 million. With the current federal budget reductions, SMUD has typically been receiving aggregate annual cash subsidy payments with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds of approximately $9.2 million. It is possible that future federal budget actions could further reduce, or eliminate entirely, the annual cash subsidy payments with respect to Build America Bonds, including the annual cash subsidy payments payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. SMUD cannot predict the likelihood of the further reduction or elimination of the Build America Bonds subsidy payments. A significant reduction or elimination of the cash subsidy.

# INSURANCE

SMUD maintains a comprehensive property/casualty insurance program designed to protect against catastrophic losses that would have an adverse effect on its financial position or operational capabilities. Insurance programs are continuously reviewed and modified when construction, operational exposures, or developments in the insurance industry so warrant. Long-term relationships with a variety of insurers minimize SMUD’s susceptibility to the effects of market cycles. SMUD budgets reserves to meet potential insurance deductibles and self-insured liability claims.

SMUD safeguards assets with all-risk property and boiler/machinery insurance with limits of $800 million per occurrence for physical damage and business interruption combined. Various coverage sublimits and deductibles apply to losses arising from certain perils, such as business interruption, earthquake, or flood, respectively. Liability insurance is in effect to defend and indemnify SMUD against third party claims, including general, automobile and sudden and accidental pollution claims with policy limits of $140 million, and wildfire coverage with policy limits of $275 million, all of which include a variety of self-insured retentions.

Nuclear property and liability insurance policies are maintained in accordance with the NRC’s requirements for decommissioned nuclear plants that maintain dry storage of spent fuel on-site. This includes $100 million in first party property damage and decontamination, $100 million for nuclear liability arising from accidents on-site, $200 million for supplier’s and transporter’s nuclear liability, and $300 million for nuclear worker liability. SMUD is exposed to possible retrospective assessments for nuclear property events occurring at other nuclear facilities in the United States capped at ten times SMUD’s annual nuclear property premium (currently the maximum retrospective assessment is approximately $1,000,000).

Other types of insurance include non-owned aircraft liability, workers’ compensation, crime, cyber security, fidelity, fiduciary liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, professional errors and omissions, transportation, and builder’s risk for major facilities under construction.

# LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

SMUD is a party to numerous actions arising out of the conduct of its business and affairs, some of which are discussed below. SMUD believes that any losses or adverse financial results it may suffer in these current actions, to the extent not covered by insurance, would not, in the aggregate, have an adverse material impact on SMUD, its business and affairs, or results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

## Environmental Litigation

SMUD was one of many potentially responsible parties that had been named in a number of actions relating to environmental claims and/or complaints. SMUD has resolved these environmental claims and/or complaints and entered into settlement agreements and/or consent orders. These settlement agreements and consent orders have statutory reopener provisions which allow regulatory agencies to seek additional funds for environmental remediation under certain limited circumstances. While SMUD believes it is unlikely that any of the prior settlements or consent orders will be reopened, the possibility exists. If any of the settlements or consent orders were to be reopened, SMUD believes that the outcome will not have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

## Proposition 26 Lawsuit

In October 2019, two SMUD customers jointly filed a complaint against SMUD (subsequently one of the customers removed themselves from the complaint), which stated that SMUD’s Board violated

A-60
<!-- Page 514 -->
![Proposition 26](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Proposition+26)

**Proposition 26** (see “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Proposition 26” for a description of Proposition 26) when on June 24, 2019, it adopted rate increases for 2020 and 2021. The plaintiff contended the rates did not reflect SMUD’s reasonable cost of service because they included a 9.2% scalar that SMUD applies to its TOD residential rate restructure adopted by SMUD’s Board in the 2017 rate process. SMUD viewed the lawsuit as having little merit and while SMUD anticipated the court would rule in SMUD’s favor on substantive grounds, the plaintiff in early 2024 agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice due to their failure to diligently prosecute the case. On January 16, 2024, the court approved the dismissal.

On January 19, 2024, the same plaintiff, along with a second SMUD residential customer, jointly filed a new complaint challenging the September 21, 2023, SMUD Board adoption of 2024 and 2025 rate increases. The plaintiffs make a similar claim regarding the TOD scalar as the prior lawsuit. Given the little merit behind the lawsuit, SMUD believes the court will rule in its favor. However, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the case or, if to the extent SMUD ultimately is not successful in the litigation, what remedies against SMUD may be available. SMUD believes that if it is not successful in the litigation, and to the extent the outcome would have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, the Board would make appropriate rate modifications based on an evidentiary record consistent with guidance from a judicial decision in the case.

**Other Litigation Matters**

Currently, SMUD is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints relating to its operations, including, but not limited to, property damage, personal injury, contract disputes, and employment matters. SMUD believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

**FERC Administrative Proceedings**

SMUD is involved in a number of FERC administrative proceedings related to the operation of wholesale energy markets, regional transmission planning, gas transportation and NERC reliability standards. These proceedings generally fall into the following categories: (i) filings initiated by the CAISO (or other market participants) to adopt/modify the CAISO Tariff and/or establish market design and behavior rules; (ii) filings initiated by existing transmission owners (i.e., PG&E and the other IOUs) to pass-through costs to their existing wholesale transmission customers; (iii) filings initiated by FERC to market participants to establish market design and behavior rules or investigate market behavior by certain market participants; (iv) filings initiated by transmission owners under their transmission owner tariffs to establish a regional transmission planning process; (v) filings initiated by providers of firm gas transportation services under the Natural Gas Act; and (vi) filings initiated by NERC to develop reliability standards applicable to owners, users, and operators of the bulk electric system. In addition, SMUD is an active participant in other FERC administrative proceedings, including those related to reliability, variable resource integration and the changing resource mix, and transmission planning and cost allocation. SMUD believes that determinations of these FERC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

**CPUC Administrative Proceedings**

Periodically, PG&E seeks to update its gas transmission and storage (“GT&S”) revenue requirements and rate designs. These applications are litigated at the CPUC and affect SMUD through several tariff rates SMUD pays to move natural gas along PG&E’s backbone transmission lines. In the 2019 GT&S rate case (the “2019 GT&S Case”), the CPUC affirmed the application in GT&S rates of cost causation principles to prevent excessive and unreasonable costs being shifted to electric generator. 

A-61

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

backbone customers like SMUD, either through proposed changes in PG&E’s natural gas storage strategy or through cost shifts within the electric generator customer class.

PG&E filed its 2023 General Rate Case (the “GRC”) in June 2021 which includes its gas transmission and storage revenue requirements. In September 2021, PG&E filed an application for approval of its Gas Cost Allocation and Rate Design Proposals (“CARD”). The CPUC issued a decision in the GRC in November 2023 authorizing PG&E’s revenue requirements for the four-year rate period of 2023-2026. SMUD is a party to the comprehensive all-party settlement agreement submitted to the CPUC for approval in June 2023 which, if approved, would resolve all open issues in the CARD proceeding. SMUD does not believe that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. SMUD will continue to actively participate in PG&E’s GRC and CARD proceedings to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to non-core customers, including electric generator backbone customers.

In the GRC, the CPUC directed PG&E to submit an application to revise its natural gas curtailment procedures “similar to the curtailment procedures of other large energy utilities”. SMUD will actively participate in this future proceeding.

Separately, SMUD continues to participate and monitor a proceeding at the CPUC concerning long-term gas system planning. At this point in these proceedings, SMUD does not anticipate that the resolution of such cases will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

SMUD monitors a number of other CPUC proceedings. These proceedings generally fall into three categories: (i) filings initiated by PG&E to adopt/modify its tariffs and/or rules; (ii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish market design and behavior rules or program rules affecting SMUD customers; and (iii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish electric and/or gas system safety design and maintenance rules. SMUD believes that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR

California Electric Market

In 1996, the State partially deregulated its electric energy market and the CAISO was established in 1998. Since the CAISO’s formation, the State has experienced episodes of higher and more volatile prices for natural gas and wholesale electricity. In reaction to such conditions, SMUD made significant changes to its business strategy to mitigate the impacts of the more volatile and unpredictable energy markets. Volatility in energy prices in the State are always a potential risk due to a variety of factors which affect both the supply and demand for electricity in the western United States. These factors include, but are not limited to, the implementation of the CAISO market design changes, insufficient generation resources, the increase in intermittent renewable energy resources, natural gas price volatility, fuel costs and availability, weather and natural disasters, transmission constraints and levels of hydroelectric generation within the region. While SMUD has taken a number of steps to mitigate its exposure to price volatility associated with these factors, this price volatility under extreme conditions may contribute to greater volatility in SMUD’s net revenues from the purchase and sale of electric energy and, therefore, could materially adversely affect the financial condition and liquidity of SMUD. For a discussion of SMUD’s current resource planning activities and risk management strategies, see “BUSINESS STRATEGY” above.

<!-- Page 516 -->
# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity continues to be a top priority for SMUD. Attacks or threats directed at critical electric or energy sector operations could damage or cause the shut-down of generation, transmission or distribution assets that are essential to SMUD’s ability to serve its customers, cause operational malfunctions and outages affecting SMUD’s electric system, and result in costly recovery and remediation efforts. The costs of security measures or of remedying breaches could be material.

SMUD participates in sharing and receiving information about cyber security threats in real-time through the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (“E-ISAC”), the central hub for such data to actively manage risk related to potential cyber intrusion. SMUD also participates in NERC’s development of mandatory, enforceable cyber security standards to address vulnerabilities in electric utility systems. SMUD also adopts voluntary measures suggested as best practices by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) in its national framework.

SMUD’s prudent response to this ever-changing threat requires constant monitoring and frequent updates to implement new regulatory requirements as they are developed. SMUD manages risk related to frequently changing regulatory requirements by participating in the development of standards at NERC and NIST and through active engagement in the cyber security policy dialogue in Congress.

# Physical Security

Physical security is a critical concern for electric utilities as they seek to protect their infrastructure from a range of threats. The electric utility infrastructure is complex and consists of multiple components, such as power plants, substations, transmission and distribution lines, and other facilities. SMUD employs a dedicated physical security team that is deployed 24/7 and allows SMUD to respond to emergent events in a safe, coordinated, efficient, and cohesive manner, protecting the lives of its employees, customers, community, properties and assets. SMUD has policies, processes and procedures in place that outline the access controls and restrictions for its properties. SMUD restricts access based on need as it determines, while adhering to applicable laws, regulations and standards such as NERC Reliability Standards and NRC regulations. SMUD also maintains a Utility Security Plan adopted by the Board representing SMUD’s compliance with the CPUC’s Safety and Enforcement Division six-step security plan process described in CPUC Decision 19-01-018.

During times of elevated, imminent threats, safety and/or security concerns, SMUD’s Security Operations team, under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer or delegate, reserves the right to deploy additional security measures, controls, and further restrict or limit access to its properties to increase its security posture.

SMUD operates a 24/7 security operations center which monitors and coordinates responses to situations reported by internal and external stakeholders, or which are detected by SMUD’s security technology. The technology includes access control, video surveillance, and various types of intrusion detection solutions. The security operations center is a central hub for initial contact for physical security calls from employees of suspicious events and initiates incident responses as needed.

# Federal Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings

## Energy Policy Act of 2005

On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct of 2005”) was signed into law. The law includes a number of energy-related provisions, including among other things limited FERC jurisdiction over interstate transmission assets of municipal utilities, cooperatives and federal utilities to order these entities to provide transmission services on rates and terms. 

A-63
<!-- Page 517 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Federal Regulation of Transmission Access.** The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the “Energy Policy Act”) made fundamental changes in the federal regulation of the electric utility industry, particularly in the area of transmission access. The Energy Policy Act provided FERC with the authority to require a transmitting utility to provide transmission services at rates, charges, terms and conditions set by FERC. The purpose of these changes, in part, was to bring about increased competition in the electric utility industry. Under the Energy Policy Act, electric utilities owned by municipalities and other public agencies which own or operate electric power transmission facilities which are used for the sale of electric energy at wholesale are “transmitting utilities” subject to the requirements of the Energy Policy Act.

Since the Energy Policy Act, FERC has adopted a series of rules to implement competitive open access to transmission facilities and regional transmission planning. Order No. 888, issued in 1996, requires the provision of open access transmission services on a nondiscriminatory basis by all “jurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does not include municipal entities like SMUD) by requiring all such utilities to file OATTs. Order No. 888 also requires “nonjurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does include SMUD) that purchase transmission services from a jurisdictional utility under an open access tariff and that owns or controls transmission facilities to provide open access service to the jurisdictional utility under terms that are comparable to the service that the nonjurisdictional utility provides itself. Section 211 of the EPAct of 2005 authorizes, but does not require, FERC to direct transmission utilities to provide transmission services, including rates and terms and conditions, that are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting utility provides transmission services to itself that are not unduly discriminatory or preferential – often referred to as the reciprocity rule.

In Order 890, issued in 2007, FERC stated that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis and retain the current reciprocity provisions.

In 2011, FERC issued Order 1000, which among other things requires public utility (jurisdictional) transmission providers to participate in a regional transmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan and that incorporates a regional and inter-regional cost allocation methodology. Similar to Order 890, FERC states that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis. However, in Order 1000, FERC appears to expand upon the current reciprocity provisions and states that it has the authority to allocate costs to beneficiaries of services provided by specific transmission facilities even in the absence of a contractual relationship between the owner of the transmission facilities and the identified beneficiary.

SMUD, individually, and through the Large Public Power Council (“LPPC”), appealed Order 1000, but in 2014 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the arguments raised on appeal, upholding the entirety of Order 1000.

The jurisdictional members of WestConnect filed their proposed regional planning process and cost allocation methodology through a series of compliance filings at FERC. FERC accepted binding cost allocation for jurisdictional transmission providers of WestConnect and mandated that non-jurisdictional transmission providers (such as SMUD) identified as beneficiaries of a project have the ability to not accept the cost allocation. WestConnect’s Order 1000 planning process began with the 2016-2017 planning cycle. 

A-64
<!-- Page 518 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

However, in response to FERC’s WestConnect orders on compliance, El Paso Electric Company (“El Paso”), a jurisdictional transmission provider, petitioned to the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. El Paso contends that FERC’s WestConnect orders violate Order 1000’s cost causation principle because WestConnect’s binding cost allocation applies only to the jurisdictional transmission providers and thus forces jurisdictional transmission providers to subsidize projects benefiting non-jurisdictional transmission providers that opt-out of projects. The non-jurisdictional transmission providers agreed on a settlement with the jurisdictional transmission providers to resolve the matters on appeal in the 5th Circuit, but FERC ultimately did not accept the settlement. On August 2, 2023, the court reversed FERC’s orders implementing Order No. 1000 for WestConnect concerning cost allocation of regional transmission projects to non-jurisdictional transmission providers. The court found that the WestConnect orders are incompatible with Order No. 1000’s application of the cost causation principle to address free ridership. There is uncertainty at this time on the future of WestConnect’s regional planning process. FERC has not yet acted on its own in light of the Fifth Circuit’s decision, and it is uncertain whether it will act while it is working on an updated transmission planning and cost allocation proposal that could change the Order 1000 process (as further discussed below regarding the April 21, 2022 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking). It is also uncertain if and/or the extent to which the jurisdictional transmission providers in WestConnect will file revisions to the regional transmission planning provisions in their OATTs. In the meantime, the WestConnect planning has continued under the existing framework and SMUD, along with the other non-jurisdictional transmission providers, continue to participate in the WestConnect process. SMUD’s longstanding objective is to comply with open access requirements necessary to achieve reciprocity, including through participation in a regional planning process while binding itself to mandatory cost allocation. Thus, SMUD has an interest in continuing to explore options for participation in a regional transmission planning process if the WestConnect rules are modified to permit SMUD to reasonably participate consistent with its business and jurisdictional interests.

SMUD is unable to predict at this time the full impact that Order 1000, or the 5th Circuit’s August decision, will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the WestConnect process generally. However, WestConnect has conducted multiple planning cycles under its Order 1000 planning process and has not identified any project eligible for cost allocation. SMUD will continue to take any action necessary, including withdrawing from a cost allocation determination or planning region, and engaging in FERC proceedings, to ensure that it is not required to pay for transmission costs in the absence of an agreement or service relationship.

On April 21, 2022, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation and Generator Interconnection (the “NOPR”). The NOPR seeks input on proposals that would impact the Order 1000 planning and cost allocation process. SMUD has been engaged in the proceeding, providing input and helping draft comments with trade organizations, including LPPC. FERC has not issued any subsequent order. SMUD will continue to monitor and be engaged in any developments at FERC that impact the Order 1000 process and its regional transmission planning participation.

NERC Reliability Standards. The EPAct of 2005 required FERC to certify an electric reliability organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable reliability standards, subject to FERC review and approval. On February 3, 2006, FERC issued Order 672, which certified NERC as the ERO. Many reliability standards have since been approved by FERC, including those aimed at protecting the bulk electric system from physical and cyber threats.

The ERO or the regional entities, such as WECC, may enforce the reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight or FERC may independently enforce reliability standards. Potential monetary sanctions include fines of up to $1,544,521 per violation per day. Order 693 provides ERO and regional entities with

A-65
<!-- Page 519 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the discretion necessary to assess penalties for such violations, while also having discretion to calculate a penalty without collecting the penalty if circumstances warrant.

**Anti-Market Manipulation Rules.** EPAct of 2005 gave FERC the authority to issue rules to prevent market manipulation in jurisdictional wholesale power and gas markets, and in jurisdictional transmission and transportation services. These anti-market manipulation rules apply to non-jurisdictional entities such as SMUD. Further, EPAct of 2005 provided FERC civil penalty authority, which the Commission has stated that it will exercise carefully by assuring that its market manipulation rules are clear.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions.** Since 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions from different sources, including from the electric sector.

In 2014, EPA issued a proposed rule under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) called the Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”) that projected power sector emissions reductions of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed CPP would have established a rate-based emissions goal for each state, providing states the responsibility to develop a State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) describing how each will meet the goal assigned by EPA using the “Best System of Emissions Reduction” (“BSER”) established by EPA. The rule was finalized in October 2015.

In November 2015, 27 states and numerous corporations challenged the CPP in court, alleging that EPA had exceeded its authority under the CAA; however, before the issue could be decided by the court, the 2016 presidential election resulted in a change of administration. The new administration quickly moved for an abeyance (or stay) of the case for as long as the agency needed to review and withdraw the CPP. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the pending disposition in the D.C. Circuit and any subsequent review by the Supreme Court. In August 2018, EPA proceeded to withdraw the CPP and the D.C. Circuit ultimately dismissed the case on September 17, 2019. EPA proposed a different rule under the same provision of the CAA, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which would have established a BSER that only includes measures that can be undertaken at an individual power plant, rather than the broader suite of measures envisioned under the CPP. The ACE rule was challenged in court by environmental groups and states alleging that the revised rule inadequately responds to EPA’s responsibility to protect public health and welfare. SMUD joined in this litigation along with other challengers. The D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule on January 10, 2021, and remanded it to the EPA for review and revision, just days before a new presidential administration took office. Several states led by West Virginia and coal industry members appealed the decision.

In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in West Virginia v. EPA, striking down the CPP and foreclosing any future regulations of “significant political and economic significance” if Congress has not expressly authorized them. While the decision does not restrict EPA to only requiring measures “inside the fence line” at an individual power plant to control GHGs, it appears unlikely that the EPA will be able to require material reductions in GHGs to mitigate climate change through section 111(d) of the CAA.

Under the new presidential administration, in May 2023, the EPA issued a proposed rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA to reduce GHG emissions from existing and new power plants. The four-part proposed rule, **New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; and Repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy Rule**, would set both GHG emission standards for certain subcategories of new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants operating greater than 50% of the time and generating more than 300 MW per turbine. In the proposed rule, EPA determined the BSER is either deploying carbon capture and storage

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

technology to capture 90% of emissions or co-firing 96% hydrogen produced through a low-emission process (“low-GHG hydrogen”). If finalized, compliance is required by 2032. SMUD has filed comments as part of several trade groups and coalitions in response to the proposed rule. SMUD’s internal analysis shows the rule as proposed would not require changes at any of its currently-operating fossil-fueled power plants and therefore will not have a material impact on SMUD’s financial position, operations, or liquidity.

## Federal Communications Commission

The 1978 Pole Attachment Act added section 224 to the Communications Act of 1934, authorizing the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to regulate attachments by cable television systems or providers of telecommunications service to utility poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way. Under Section 224(a)(1), public power entities are exempt from FCC pole attachment regulations, as municipally-owned poles are already subject to local decision-making processes and governance. The municipal exemption from FCC pole attachment regulations was further codified through the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, over the past decade, this exemption has been continuously eroded.

Various actions by the FCC have limited the exemption in support of a “uniform policy for broadband access to privately-owned physical infrastructure.” Through four orders issued between 2017 and 2018, the FCC set strict time limits for the review of pole attachment applications and preempted state and local agreements on pole attachments. In 2020, in *City of Portland v. United States*, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the FCC’s Small Cell Order, which adopted new time limits for municipal utilities’ review of wireless infrastructure siting applications and preempted access for small cell installations. In November 2023, the FCC adopted its Fourth Report and Order, Declaratory Ruling, and Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which established new rules and the timeline for the approval process for pole attachment applications, among other things. SMUD will monitor this proceeding for any potential impact to SMUD.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new FCC rulemakings will impact the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system.

## Federal Clean Energy Legislation

SMUD actively participates in discussion at the federal level regarding legislation that would meaningfully impact SMUD’s existing GHG reduction strategies or impose new requirements for electric generators, including a proposed federal clean energy standard. In the 117th Congress, a clean electricity performance program was considered but ultimately lacked support to pass. Instead, Congress extended and expanded clean energy tax credits and created new grant and rebate programs to incentivize clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While it is possible that a future Congress may revisit the concept of a clean energy standard or other GHG reduction regime, it is possible that the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will diminish the likelihood of a new regulatory framework being enacted in the near future.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new EPA rulemakings will be undertaken, and what the full impact of the reduction of fossil-based generation over time will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the electric utility industry generally.

## State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills provide for reduced GHG emission standards and greater investment in energy efficient and environmentally friendly generation alternatives through more stringent RPS. Additionally, ongoing regulatory proceedings address the implementation of these bills as well as water flow and quality.

![Greenhouse Gas Emissions Summary](https://example.com/image.png)

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions.** On September 27, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (“AB 32”). AB 32 requires the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to adopt enforceable GHG emission limits and emission reduction measures in order to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In addition, AB 32 establishes a mandatory reporting program for all IOUs, local, publicly-owned electric utilities and other load-serving entities (electric utilities providing energy to end-use customers) (“LSEs”). The AB 32 reporting program allows CARB to adopt regulations using market-based compliance mechanisms such as a “cap-and-trade” system.

On December 16, 2010, CARB approved a resolution adopting cap-and-trade regulations for the State. The regulations became effective on January 1, 2012. As adopted, the cap-and-trade program covers sources accounting for 85% of the State’s GHG emissions, the largest program of its type in the United States. In November of 2012, CARB conducted its first allowance auction and auctions now occur on a quarterly schedule.

The cap-and-trade program introduced a hard emissions cap that declines over time on the combined electric utility and large industrial sectors, covering all sources emitting more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases (“CO2e”) per year, and was subsequently expanded to cover distributors of transportation, natural gas, and other fossil fuels. The cap-and-trade program requires covered entities to retire compliance instruments (allowances and carbon offsets) for each metric ton of CO2e they emit. CARB has allocated free allowances to LSEs to mitigate the compliance cost burden on ratepayers. The value of allowances must be used to benefit ratepayers and achieve GHG emission reductions. The cap-and-trade program also allows covered entities to offset their compliance obligations, not exceeding 8% of a regulated entity’s compliance obligation through 2020, 4% from 2021 through 2025, and 6% from 2026 through 2030. Offsets must be obtained from certified projects in sectors that are not regulated under the cap-and-trade program and are subject to other restrictions.

The State's cap-and-trade program was briefly linked to companion program in the Canadian province of Ontario during 2018 but was de-linked following a political change. In 2021, the Washington state legislature passed a cap-and-trade bill, which is expected to interact with the State’s markets. Future potential near-term links to the CARB cap-and-trade program also include the states of Oregon, which has adopted a cap-and-trade program, and New Mexico, which is considering the adoption of a cap-and-trade program.

On October 7, 2015, SB 350 was enacted, containing aggressive goals for reducing carbon emissions by 2030, including raising the proportion of renewable energy to 50%, reducing the use of petroleum fuel in cars and trucks by up to 50%, and doubling the energy efficiency of existing buildings. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” for additional information. In addition, SB 350 established requirements for larger POUs to adopt and file with the CEC Integrated Resource Plans (“IRPs”) by April 2019 that would show planned procurement to achieve the 50% RPS and State GHG goals established by CARB. The CEC developed “guidelines” for these IRPs for POUs in 2017, updated them in 2018, and proposed additional updates in 2022. CARB established specific GHG target ranges for these IRPs in summer 2018, which were revised in 2023 following the adoption of CARB’s 2022 Scoping Plan. SMUD developed and adopted an IRP in 2018 through a comprehensive public process and filed the adopted IRP with the CEC in April 2019. SMUD adopted an updated IRP in June 2022 and filed the updated IRP with the CEC in September 2022, but the CEC has not yet completed its review of SMUD’s 2022 IRP. SMUD’s updated IRP plans for a greater than 92% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 relative to 1990 levels, which equals approximately A-68.

250,000 metric tons of GHG emissions in 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change.”

On April 29, 2015, the Governor of the State signed Executive Order B-30-15, establishing a goal for the State to reduce GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2016, the State Legislature passed Senate Bill 32 (“SB 32”), which codified then-Governor Brown’s goal of reducing the State’s GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2017, the State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 398 (“AB 398”), explicitly authorizing the continuation of the cap-and-trade program, with designated changes, through 2030. Subsequently, CARB adopted an initial set of regulatory changes extending the cap-and-trade program, including establishing utility sector allowance allocations through 2030. In 2018, CARB completed a rulemaking to implement the cap-and-trade program changes designated by AB 398. These changes include development of a hard price ceiling for the cap-and-trade program and two price-containment points below that ceiling, in an attempt to ensure stable prices in the program. CARB adopted final regulations on December 13, 2018.

In addition, any new projects constructed in the State, including power plants, that may cause a significant adverse impact on the environment must be analyzed under CEQA. Some State agencies have begun using CEQA in novel ways to require mitigation of “significant” GHG emissions caused, either directly or indirectly, by a project. Pursuant to Senate Bill 97 passed in 2007, CARB will assist the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research in setting thresholds of significance under CEQA of GHG impacts from new projects. This is an area of State law that is evolving and unsettled in the courts. However, there is a risk that any project proponent of an electric system infrastructure project might have to mitigate such potential impacts to a level of less than significant.

On December 3, 2012, the Superior Court issued a ruling in Environmental Defense Fund v. San Diego Association of Governments (“SANDAG”), Case No. 2100-00101593, that sided with the State Attorney General and the other petitioners stating that SANDAG did not follow CEQA when it adopted a $257 billion regional transportation plan in 2011. The ruling expressly invalidated the certification of the Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) on the grounds that the EIR should have analyzed the plan’s consistency with the governor’s policy goal to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050 as articulated in the 2005 Executive Order S-03-05. On November 24, 2014, the Fourth Appellate District upheld the trial court in a published decision, and SANDAG appealed to the State Supreme Court. On July 13, 2017, the Supreme Court reversed and held that SANDAG’s decision to not adopt the 2050 goal was not an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, the Court articulated three clear principles for agencies to follow in their CEQA review of planning documents: 1) agencies must take seriously the significance of even small increases in GHG emissions; 2) they must consider science-based State policy guidance in their decision-making; and 3) they are required to use the best scientific information available to determine whether their planning decisions are consistent with the State’s goals. These principles will apply to SMUD in CEQA reviews of future projects.

On September 29, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law Senate Bill 1368 (“SB 1368”), the GHG Emissions Performance Standard (“EPS”). SB 1368 limits long-term investments in baseload generation by the State’s utilities to power plants that meet an EPS jointly established by the CEC and the CPUC. The agencies have set the EPS at 1,100 pounds CO2 per MWh, which is roughly half of the CO2 emissions rate of a conventional coal-fired power plant. CEC regulations to implement the law for POUs were approved by the Office of Administrative Law on October 16, 2007.

SMUD’s primary supply and demand-side resources need to meet customers’ electric usage patterns over the next 10 years. Currently there is a ban in the State that prohibits the development of nuclear power plants until there is a permanent storage solution for spent fuel rods. With the effective ban on new coal power imports under SB 1368, natural gas-fired, combined cycle power plants would appear

A-69

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+available)

to be the primary viable option for fossil fuel-based baseload power plant development absent the implementation of new technologies in connection with other resource options. The reliance on a single fuel source will continue to put pressure on the natural gas market in the United States. SMUD has in place a natural gas procurement plan to mitigate natural gas volatility, see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply” above.

On September 16, 2022, the Governor of the State signed into law SB 1020, which creates interim climate targets under which eligible renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources must supply 90% of all retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers by December 31, 2035, and 95% by December 31, 2040. The bill also requires each State agency to ensure that zero carbon resources and eligible renewable energy resources supply 100% of electricity procured on its behalf by December 31, 2035. SMUD provides electricity to a number of State agency buildings and will work with State agencies to comply with this requirement.

On October 7, 2023, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 1305, which requires an entity that purchases or uses voluntary carbon offsets and makes claims regarding the achievement of net zero, or other similar claims, to disclose on their website specified information. Many stakeholder groups are raising questions on if this includes RECs. Clean-up legislation could follow. It is not clear at this time whether RECs are included.

Reliability. On June 30, 2022, the Governor signed the 2022-23 budget, along with a number of trailer bills, which provide implementing details on the budget line items. Included in AB 205, the energy trailer bill, are a number of reliability programs.

1. CEC Distributed Electricity Backup Assets Program to incentivize the construction of cleaner and more efficient distributed energy assets that would serve as on-call emergency supply or load reduction for the state’s electrical grid during extreme events. The CEC adopted program guidelines in October 2023 and issued the first solicitation in December 2023.

2. CEC Demand Side Grid Support Program to pay customers to reduce demand during stressed grid events. SMUD has actively engaged the CEC on the development and subsequent revision of program guidelines. The CEC is expected to revise the guidelines again for summer 2024.

3. DWR Strategic Reliability Reserve to secure resources for summer reliability or to preserve the option to extend the life of facilities that otherwise would retire, new temporary generators of more than five MW, new energy storage systems of at least 20 MW, generation facilities that use clean, zero-emission fuel technologies, or new zero-emission technologies that can be operational by December 31, 2026.

As a follow up to this legislation, the Governor signed into law AB 1373. The bill authorizes the CEC to annually assess a capacity payment on a POU within the CAISO balancing authority area during a month in which the POU fails to meet its minimum planning reserve margin. This does not include SMUD, who is within the BANC balancing authority area. SMUD is, however, required to submit to the CEC an assessment of whether it exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin and system resource adequacy requirements. This bill also allows the DWR, for certain types of long-development projects, to act as a central procurement entity. For POUs, participation in the DWR program would be optional.

Zero-Emission Fleet Mandates. CARB has adopted the Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”) regulation, requiring certain medium- and heavy-duty (“MHD”) vehicle fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles through purchase requirements or fleet composition requirements, which took effect on November

A-70
<!-- Page 524 -->
1, 2023, and applies to all publicly owned MHD fleets, larger commercially owned MHD fleets, and drayage trucks. Under the ACF Rule, public fleets like SMUD have two compliance options. The first is a zero-emission vehicle (“ZEV”) purchase requirement, under which 50% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2024, and 100% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2027. The second is an optional ZEV milestone option, under which the composition of the MHD fleet would need to meet certain ZEV percentages starting in 2025, with the entire fleet transitioned no later than 2042. The individual milestones depend on the number and category of vehicles in the fleet. Public fleets may opt into the ZEV milestone option until January 1, 2030. In 2024, SMUD plans to comply with the purchase requirement option, meaning that 50% of the MHD vehicles would be ZEVs. SMUD plans to monitor ZEV market developments and currently expects to opt into the ZEV milestone option as more ZEVs become available. The ACF Rule also accelerates a manufacturer ZEV sales requirement to 100% of all MHD truck sales by the 2036 model year.

CARB proposed the Zero-Emission Forklift regulation in November 2023. The regulation would require forklift fleets to transition spark-ignited forklifts to zero-emission technology starting in 2026. The regulation would apply to SMUD, as a forklift operator. Since SMUD has a limited number of forklifts, this regulation is not expected to have a material effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operation.

Transportation and Building Electrification. In recent years, the State has identified transportation and building electrification as key strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, and is advancing policy to support or accelerate electrification. For example, in addition to the zero-emission fleet mandates and LCFS regulations discussed herein, CARB adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks regulations to require vehicle manufacturers to increase sales of zero-emission vehicles, respectively. The CEC’s Building Energy Efficiency Standards are also encouraging the use of electric heat pumps in new homes and certain non-residential buildings across the state. The draft 2025 Energy Standards, which are expected to be proposed by April 2024 and adopted by August 2024, would establish prescriptive heat pump requirements for both space and water heating in new homes, and may require existing homes to install a heat pump when replacing an air conditioner. The 2025 Energy Standards, if approved, would take effect on January 1, 2025. In addition, the State has also provided funding for programs to encourage clean transportation and building electrification.

Increases in transportation and building electrification will result in increased customer usage of electricity.

Renewables Portfolio Standard. Senate Bill 100 was passed by the Legislature and approved by Governor Brown on September 10, 2018. Among other requirements, the bill sets a 50% RPS target for 2026 and sets compliance period targets at 44% by December 31, 2024, 52% by December 31, 2027, and 60% by December 31, 2030. The bill also creates a statewide planning goal to meet all of the state’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.

Sacramento-San Joaquin River Bay-Delta Processes. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is an expansive inland estuary, formed at the western edge of the California Central Valley by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers (“Delta”). There are two substantial Delta planning processes with the potential to affect (1) energy available for SMUD’s purchase from the Central Valley Project (“CVP”) and (2) flows within the Upper American River watershed. These processes are called the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan (“Bay-Delta Plan”) and the Delta Conveyance Project.

The Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan is updated periodically by the State Water Resources Control Board (“SWRCB”), the last time being in 2006. The current Bay-Delta Plan update process is being implemented in four phases. The first phase considered southern Delta water quality, with a

A-71
<!-- Page 525 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)  
significant focus on San Joaquin River tributaries. Phase 2, which is initially being addressed by a document under development by SWRCB staff, will address Sacramento River tributaries and various flow related issues, including the critically important one of those tributaries’ contribution to Delta outflow. Phase 3 will concern changes to water rights needed to implement Phase 2. A substantial change in Delta outflow requirements could have a major impact on the timing of hydroelectric energy generation by the CVP. SMUD has a long-term agreement with WAPA to purchase some of this power (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration”). On July 18, 2018, the SWRCB released an updated Framework document signaling its staff’s intent to propose Delta outflow requirements of 45-65% unimpaired flows for the Sacramento River tributaries (which includes the American River, the upper portions of which are where the AUR sits), though the report will analyze requirements of 35-75%. If these criteria were implemented, they could cut CVP generation by 50 to 63%. Governor Newsom has urged the SWRCB, other agencies and affected parties to execute voluntary agreements (aka the “Healthy Rivers Agreements”) to address species’ needs and outflow requirements. Although the negotiations have been slow, it is expected they will eventually result in a reasonable compromise. However, in September 2023 the SWRCB released a Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document to justify the adoption of the unimpaired flow standard as set forth in the 2018 Framework document. Numerous public entities, including SMUD, filed comments stating that, among other things, the potential updates identified in the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document, if adopted, would violate the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act and Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution, would not protect fish and wildlife, and would not reasonably protect all beneficial uses, including water supplies for millions of Californians and hydroelectric power generation that is essential to California’s resilient energy grid. Moreover, the comments filed also stated that the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document does not comply with CEQA because, among other things, the analysis of the proposed minimum flow standards for developed hydropower generation, while addressing generally electrical grid reliability, is not supported by substantial evidence and fails to satisfy informational requirements. In addition, the comments maintain that the Healthy Rivers Agreements are a superior approach to achieving the goal of maximizing both environmental and other beneficial uses. If the unimpaired flow standard is adopted and the Healthy Rivers Agreements do not come to fruition, SMUD plans to fully participate in all regulatory and legal proceedings to argue for consideration and minimization of impacts to hydropower generation. SMUD will assess the potential impacts of proposed modifications to the present outflow objectives on SMUD’s operations once, or if, the SWRCB makes available information with enough specificity for SMUD to conduct the relevant modeling.

In July 2022, the DWR released a Draft Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) to evaluate the potential impacts of carrying out the Delta Conveyance Project; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a separate Environmental Impact Statement to evaluate the effects of the project pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The Delta Conveyance Project is expected to entail construction of two intakes on the Sacramento River that will carry water to a main tunnel to the California Aqueduct for delivery south of the Delta. The Delta Conveyance Project may pose the potential to exacerbate impacts to already imperiled aquatic species, and in turn could have indirectly prompted regulatory agencies to require third parties, such as SMUD, to compensate by making changes to their operations. The Bureau of Reclamation is not a party to the Delta Conveyance Project, which should eliminate the potential for CVP power to be used to supply Delta Conveyance Project pumps. SMUD will monitor the proceedings and participate as necessary to ensure any impacts to SMUD interests are minimized, including potentially filing a challenge to the water rights DWR would need to modify in order to carry out the project.

Proposition 26. Proposition 26 was approved by the electorate on November 2, 2010 and amends Article XIII A and Article XIII C of the State Constitution. Proposition 26 imposes a two-thirds voter approval requirement for the imposition of fees and charges by the State, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. It also imposes a majority voter approval requirement on local governments with  
A-72
<!-- Page 526 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**A-73**

**respect to fees and charges for general purposes, and a two-thirds voter approval requirement with respect to fees and charges for special purposes, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. The initiative, according to its supporters, is intended to prevent the circumvention of tax limitations imposed by the voters pursuant to Proposition 13, approved in 1978, and other measures through the use of non-tax fees and charges. Proposition 26 expressly excludes from its scope a charge imposed for a specific local government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable cost to the local government of providing the service or product. Proposition 26 is not retroactive as applied to local governments. Although SMUD believes that the initiative was not intended to apply to fees for utility services such as those charged by SMUD and its fees and charges meet the criteria of the exclusion described above, it is possible that Proposition 26 could be interpreted to further limit fees and charges for electric utility services and/or require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes. SMUD is unable to predict at this time how Proposition 26 will be interpreted by the courts or what its ultimate impact will be. As of the date of this Official Statement, SMUD is unaware of any fees or charges relating to SMUD’s service that would have to be reduced or eliminated because of Proposition 26. However, certain of SMUD’s adopted rate increases have been challenged. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”**

**Initiative 1935.** A voter initiative entitled “The Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act” (“Initiative 1935”) has been determined to be eligible for the State’s November 2024 statewide general election and, unless withdrawn by its proponent prior to June 27, 2024, will be certified as qualified for the ballot in such election. Were it to be approved by a majority of voters in the election, Initiative 1935 would amend Article XIII C of the State Constitution to, among other things, provide that charges (or increases in charges) imposed or extended by a local government after January 1, 2022 for services or products provided directly to the payor (including, potentially, fees and charges for electric service or product) are “taxes” subject to voter approval unless the local government can provide convincing evidence that the charge is reasonable and does not exceed the “actual cost” of providing the service or product. Initiative 1935 defines “actual cost” as “(i) the minimum amount necessary to reimburse the government for the cost of providing the service or the product to the payor and (ii) where the amount charged is not used by the government for any purpose other than reimbursing that cost.” Initiative 1935 would also require that local governments impose fees and charges by ordinance (which may be subject to judicial interpretation). SMUD is unable to predict whether and how Initiative 1935, if approved, would be interpreted or applied, but it is possible any such interpretation or application could further limit fees and charges or further increase in fees and charges for electric utility services, require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes and/or otherwise adversely impact SMUD and its revenues. In response to an emergency petition filed by Governor Gavin Newsom, with support from the League of California Cities and others, the California Supreme Court has unanimously agreed to decide whether the initiative should appear on the November 2024 ballot or be disqualified. A ruling is expected before June 30, 2024, which is the deadline for placing items on the November 2024 ballot. 

**On November 2, 2023, Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 13 (“ACA 13”) was filed with the Secretary of State and will be on the ballot for the November 2024 statewide general election. If approved by voters, ACA 13 would require any initiative constitutional amendment appearing on the ballot on or after January 1, 2024, that would increase the voter approval requirement to adopt any State or local measure to be approved by the highest voter approval requirement that the initiative measure would impose. In other words, if ACA 13 is approved by voters, its express terms appear to require Initiative 1935 to pass with a 2/3 vote, since Initiative 1935 would extend a 2/3 voter requirement to additional State and local fees and charges. If adopted, ACA 13 and its effect on the adoption of Initiative 1935, if applicable, are likely to be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is not able to predict whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would be interpreted or applied or whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would affect the adoption, interpretation or application of Initiative 1935, if adopted.**

![Wildfire Legislation](https://example.com/image.png)

**Wildfire Legislation.** In response to catastrophic wildfires in California, legislation was adopted and signed into law requiring POUs (including SMUD), IOUs, and electrical cooperatives to construct, maintain and operate their electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by electrical lines and equipment. Senate Bill 247 (“SB 247”), signed by Governor Newsom on October 2, 2019, establishes notification, audit and reporting guidelines for electrical corporations relating to vegetation management requirements in the wildfire mitigation plan. SB 247 also specifies the qualifications for electrical line clearance tree trimmers performing work to comply with the vegetation management requirements in an electrical corporation’s wildfire mitigation plan and requires that qualified line clearance tree trimmers be paid no less than a specified prevailing wage rate. POUs are not required to adhere to SB 247, but the market impacts are projected to significantly increase SMUD’s annual vegetation management costs.

**Nonstock Security.** SMUD sponsored legislation in 2019, Assembly Bill 689, which was signed into law by Governor Newsom on September 5, 2019. This bill expressly allows SMUD the ability to operate a pilot project (effective January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2025), of up to three entities, to hold nonstock security in a corporation or other private entity if acquired as part of a procurement of goods or services from that entity, provided that no separate funding is expended solely for the purposes of that property. 

On September 15, 2022, the Board authorized the CEO & GM to enter into a joint collaboration agreement with ESS Tech, Inc. (“ESS”). Under that agreement SMUD would procure from ESS in flow batteries for utility scale long-duration energy storage applications. The agreement contemplates a multi-year phased deployment of up to 200MW/2GWh of long duration energy storage by 2028. As part of this procurement, SMUD acquired nonstock security in ESS.

SMUD will be sponsoring legislation in 2024 to extend the authority granted by Assembly Bill 689 to future years.

**Future Regulation**

The electric industry is subject to continuing legislative and administrative reform. States and Federal entities routinely consider changes to the way in which they regulate the electric industry. Recently, both further deregulation and forms of additional regulation have been proposed for the industry, which has been highly regulated throughout its history. SMUD is unable to predict at this time the impact any such proposals will have on the operations and finances of SMUD or the electric utility industry generally.

**OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY**

**CAISO Market Initiatives**

The CAISO routinely conducts a number of initiatives and stakeholder processes that propose certain operational and market changes that impact SMUD. SMUD does and will continue to monitor the various initiatives proposed by the CAISO and participate in its stakeholder processes to ensure that its interests are protected.

SMUD participates in the CAISO market for only a small percentage of energy needs, however, it continues to benefit from its participation in the CAISO’s WEIM and is currently exploring further participation in the CAISO’s proposed Extended Day Ahead Market (“EDAM”) (both the WEIM and EDAM are described further below). Along with monitoring other key market initiatives at the CAISO which impact wholesale energy markets, SMUD will continue to actively participate in all processes related

A-74
<!-- Page 528 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to EIM and EDAM, to ensure both participation models are beneficial to SMUD’s customers. Given its success in EIM and active engagement with the CAISO and CAISO leadership, SMUD has earned a key role in the stakeholder processes related to these important and evolving markets.

**Resource Adequacy Filing**

In September 2005, the State Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Assembly Bill 380 (“AB 380”), which requires the CPUC to establish resource adequacy requirements for all LSEs within the CPUC’s jurisdiction. SMUD is not an LSE subject to the CPUC’s jurisdiction. In 2005, the CPUC issued a decision requiring jurisdictional LSEs to demonstrate that they have acquired capacity sufficient to serve their forecast retail customer load plus a minimum 15% planning reserve margin. In June 2022, the CPUC issued a decision increasing the minimum planning reserve margin to 16% for 2023 and 17% for 2024. In June 2023, the CPUC kept the minimum planning reserve margin at 17% for 2024 and extended the 17% requirement for 2025.

AB 380 also required publicly owned utilities, including SMUD, to meet the most recent resource adequacy standard as adopted by the WECC. The WECC has yet to formally adopt a resource adequacy requirement. However, consistent with current WECC practices, SMUD utilizes a minimum 15% planning reserve margin when assessing the need for future resources. For summer 2023, SMUD attained a 17% planning reserve margin and will have at least a 17% planning reserve margin for summer 2024 as well.

In 2022, the State Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 209 (2022) (“AB 209”), which requires the CEC to develop recommendations about approaches to determining an appropriate planning reserve margin for local publicly owned utilities within the CAISO balancing authority area. The CEC has initiated a proceeding and plans to publish a report with a recommended methodology in summer 2024. The report will not directly impact SMUD since SMUD is not in the CAISO; nevertheless, SMUD is monitoring the proceeding. The State Legislature also passed Assembly Bill 1373 (2023) (“AB 1373”) that requires the CEC to submit a report to the Legislature that assesses whether each local publicly owned electric utility in California (both inside and outside the CAISO) exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin for 2023. The report must also assess whether local publicly owned utilities met the planning reserve margin for June through September 2023 established by the CPUC’s June 2022 decision (i.e., 16%). See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Reliability.”

While SMUD believes the CEC’s report will show SMUD met both its 15% planning reserve margin and the CPUC’s 16% planning reserve margin for 2023, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the report, or what the Legislature intends to do with the report. To the extent the CEC or Legislature imposes a higher POU planning reserve margin for future years that includes SMUD, the ultimate impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy/capacity, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers; however, such impacts could be material.

**Western Energy Imbalance Market and Extended Day Ahead Market**

Federal and state policymakers have long-promoted the development of organized markets in the west as a means (among other reasons) to better integrate intermittent renewable resources into the electric system, the first of which markets is the Western EIM, operated by the CAISO. The CAISO successfully launched the WEIM, a real time only imbalance market, on October 1, 2014, with PacifiCorp as the first participant. Since this time, the WEIM has grown significantly with the addition of 21 other Balancing

to sell to nongovernmental entities electricity from generation projects and transmission service from transmission line projects financed with tax exempt obligations; (i) effects of inflation on the operating and maintenance costs of an electric utility and its facilities; (j) changes from projected future load requirements; (k) increases in costs and uncertain availability of capital; (l) issues relating to supply chains and the uncertain availability or increased costs of necessary materials; (m) shifts in the availability and relative costs of different fuels (including the cost of natural gas); (n) sudden and dramatic increases in the price of energy purchased on the open market that may occur at times of high peak demand in an area of the country experiencing such high peak demand, such as has occurred in the State; (o) issues relating to risk management procedures and practices with respect to, among other things, the purchase and sale of natural gas, energy and transmission capacity; (p) other legislative changes, voter initiatives, referenda and statewide propositions; (q) effects of changes in the economy; (r) effects of possible manipulation of the electric markets; (s) natural disasters or other physical calamities, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, droughts, severe weather, wildfires and floods; (t) changes to the climate, including increasing volatility in rainfall in the Western United States and a reduction in the depth and duration of the Sierra snowpack; (u) issues relating to cyber-security; and (v) outbreaks of infectious diseases or the occurrence of pandemics. Any of these factors (as well as other factors) could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of any given electric utility, including SMUD’s electric utility, and likely will affect individual utilities in different ways.

SMUD is unable to predict what impact such factors will have on the business operations and financial condition of SMUD’s electric system, but the impact could be significant. SMUD has taken major steps to mitigate the impacts of many of the changes. This Official Statement includes a brief discussion of certain of these factors. This discussion does not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and matters are subject to change subsequent to the date hereof. Extensive information on the electric utility industry is available from the legislative and regulatory sources and other sources in the public domain, and potential purchasers of any of SMUD’s Senior Bonds or Subordinated Bonds described in the forepart of this Official Statement should obtain and review such information.

## BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

The information in this Appendix regarding DTC has been provided by DTC, and SMUD takes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness thereof. SMUD cannot and does not give any assurances that DTC, DTC Participants or Indirect Participants will distribute the Beneficial Owners either (a) payments of interest or principal with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds or (b) certificates representing ownership interest in or other confirmation of ownership interest in the 2024 Series M Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis or that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this Official Statement.

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the 2024 Series M Bonds. The 2024 Series M Bonds will be issued as fully registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.

DTC, the world’s largest depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 instruments from over 100 countries that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others, such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.

Purchases of the 2024 Series M Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the 2024 Series M Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each 2024 Series M Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their beneficial ownership interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the 2024 Series M Bonds is discontinued. 

1
<!-- Page 533 -->
To facilitate subsequent transfers, all 2024 Series M Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of the 2024 Series M Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series M Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such 2024 Series M Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series M Bonds may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the bond documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series M Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the 2024 Series M Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners.

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of a maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in the 2024 Series M Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed.

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to SMUD as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the 2024 Series M Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).

Principal, premium, redemption proceeds and interest payments on the 2024 Series M Bonds will be made to Cede & Co. or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts, upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from SMUD or the Trustee, on a
<!-- Page 534 -->
![SMUD Notice](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Notice)

SMUD may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, bond certificates for such 2024 Series M Bonds will be printed and delivered to DTC.

Neither SMUD or the Trustee will have any responsibility or obligation to Participants, to Indirect Participants or to any Beneficial Owner with respect to (i) the accuracy of any records maintained by DTC, any Participant, or any Indirect Participant; (ii) the payment by DTC or any Participant or Indirect Participant of any amount with respect to the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds; (iii) any notice which is permitted or required to be given to Holders under the Resolution; (iv) the selection by DTC, any Participant or any Indirect Participant of any person to receive payment in the event of a partial redemption of 2024 Series M Bonds; (v) any consent given or other action taken by DTC as Bondholder; or (vi) any other procedures or obligations of DTC, Participants or Indirect Participants under the book-entry system.

## SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Resolution. Other provisions of the Resolution are described under the captions “THE 2024 SERIES M BONDS” and “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS.” This summary is not to be considered a full statement of the terms of the Resolution and accordingly is qualified by reference thereto and is subject to the full text thereof. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Official Statement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

Between July 1997 and August 2003, SMUD received consents to amend the Resolution from the owners of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Bonds. Pursuant to the authority granted by such consents, SMUD amended the Resolution in October 2003 by adopting the Forty-Eighth Supplemental Resolution. The following summary of the Resolution reflects such amendments.

The purchasers of the 2024 Series M Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series M Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution (the “Proposed Amendments”). Such amendments are described in **bold italic** font in the forepart of this Official Statement under “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Rates and Charges” and “– Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues” and in this summary of the Resolution under the captions “Certain Definitions” and “Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds.” The written consents to the Proposed Amendments of the holders and registered owners of at least 60% of the Bonds outstanding have been filed with SMUD or the Trustee, as required by the Resolution. However, while certain Bonds remain outstanding SMUD must also obtain the written consents for the Proposed Amendments from the Proposed Amendments to implement the Proposed Amendments when the written consents of such bond insurers are obtained if the Bonds insured by such bond insurers are no longer outstanding. The final maturity date of the insured Bonds is July 1, 2024.

### Certain Definitions

“**Assumed Interest Payments**” means for any fiscal year or period interest which would accrue during such fiscal year or period on an amount equal to the then unamortized balance of the remaining sum of Assumed Principal Payments at the Assumed Interest Rate.

“**Assumed Interest Rate**” for any Parity Bond means an interest rate equal to the “Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index” most recently published in The Bond Buyer prior to the date of issuance of the Parity Bond to which the Assumed Interest Rate is applicable.

“**Assumed Principal Payments**” means for any fiscal year or period the sum of all amortized portions of each Excluded Principal Payment which fall within such fiscal year or period after the Excluded Principal Payments have been amortized (for purposes of this definition) equally over the years (pro rata in the case of a partial year) in the period commencing on the date of issuance of the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payment relates and ending on the date which is 30 years from such date of issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parity Bonds determined by SMUD to be an Excluded Principal Payment are refinanced with Parity Bonds determined by SMUD to be another Excluded Principal Payment, (1) Assumed Principal Payments with respect to the refinancing Parity Bonds shall not include any amount of principal which has previously been assumed amortized with respect to the refinanced Parity Bonds and (2) the period over which the refinancing Parity Bonds shall be assumed to be amortized shall be the period commencing on the date of issuance of the refinancing Parity Bonds and ending on the date which is 30 years from the date of issuance of the refinanced Parity Bonds.
<!-- Page 536 -->
“Electric System” means the entire electric system of SMUD, together with all additions, betterments, extensions and improvements.

“Energy Payments” means, when used with respect to the Electric System, all actual costs incurred, or charges made therefor, by SMUD in any particular fiscal year or period to which said term is applicable for purchased power (including power purchased from any special district included within the boundaries of SMUD), electric and thermal energy and capacity under contracts providing for payments by SMUD for electric or thermal energy or capacity whether or not such energy or capacity is delivered or capable of being delivered or otherwise made available to or received by or for the account of SMUD.

“Excluded Principal Payments” means each payment of principal on Parity Bonds which the Board of Directors of SMUD determines (on a date not later than the date of issuance of such Parity Bonds) that SMUD intends to refinance at or prior to the maturity date(s) of such Parity Bonds or otherwise to pay with moneys which are not Revenues. No such determination shall affect the security for such Parity Bonds or the obligation of SMUD to pay such payments from Revenues.

“Financial Products Agreement” means an interest rate swap, cap, collar, option, floor, forward or other hedging agreement, arrangement or security, however denominated, entered into by SMUD with a Qualified Provider not for investment purposes but with respect to specific Parity Bonds for the purpose of (1) reducing or otherwise managing SMUD’s risk of interest rate changes or (2) effectively converting SMUD’s interest rate exposure, in whole or in part, from a fixed rate exposure to a variable rate exposure, or from a variable rate exposure to a fixed rate exposure.

“Financial Product Payments” means payments periodically required to be paid to a counterparty by SMUD pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement.

“Financial Product Receipts” means amounts periodically required to be paid to SMUD by a counterparty pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement.

“Maintenance and Operation Costs” means all actual maintenance and operation costs incurred by SMUD (including purchased power and fuel costs) or charges therefor made in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, exclusive in all cases of depreciation, or obsolescence charges or reserves therefor, amortization of intangibles or other entries of a similar nature, interest charges and charges for the payment of principal of SMUD debt.

“Net Revenues” for any fiscal period means the sum of (a) the Revenues for such fiscal period plus (b) the amounts, if any, withdrawn by SMUD from the Rate Stabilization Fund for treatment as Revenues for such fiscal period, less the sum of (c) all Maintenance and Operation Costs for such fiscal period, (d) all Energy Payments for such fiscal period not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs for such fiscal period, and (e) the amounts, if any, withdrawn by SMUD from Revenues for such fiscal period for deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund pursuant to the Resolution.

“Parity Bonds” includes the Bonds and all revenue bonds issued on a parity with the Bonds as provided or permitted in the Resolution. No Parity Bonds (other than the Bonds) are currently outstanding.

“Qualified Provider” means any financial institution or insurance company which is a party to a Financial Products Agreement if the unsecured long-term debt obligations of such financial institution or insurance company (or of the parent or a subsidiary of such financial institution or insurance company) if such parent or subsidiary unconditionally guarantees the performance of such financial institution or insurance company under such Financial Products Agreement and the Trustee receives an opinion of
<!-- Page 537 -->

**Rate Stabilization Fund** means the fund by that name established in the Resolution. From time to time, after provision for debt service, SMUD may deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund from remaining Revenues such amounts as SMUD shall determine, provided that deposits may be made until (but not after) the date 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. SMUD may withdraw amounts from the Rate Stabilization Fund only for inclusion in Revenues for any fiscal year, such withdrawals to be made until (but not after) 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. All interest or other earnings on deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be withdrawn therefrom and accounted for as Revenues. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no deposit of Revenues to the Rate Stabilization Fund may be made to the extent such Revenues were included in an engineer’s certificate submitted in connection with the issuance of additional revenue bonds payable from Revenues and withdrawal of the Revenues to be deposited in the Rate Stabilization Fund from the Revenues employed in rendering said engineer’s certificate would have caused noncompliance with the provisions of the Resolution restricting issuance of additional obligations or securities payable from Revenues or to the extent any withdrawal of amounts from remaining Revenues for the Rate Stabilization Fund for any fiscal year would have reduced the debt service ratio referred to in this Appendix under the caption “Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds” to or below 1.40.

**Revenues** means all revenues derived by SMUD from the operation of the Electric System, or arising from the Electric System (consisting primarily of income derived from the sale or use of electric energy generated, transmitted or distributed by SMUD from the Electric System, but also including receipts from the sale of property pertaining to the Electric System or incidental to the operation of the Electric System or from services performed by SMUD in connection with the Electric System and revenues derived from certain wholesale, but not retail, sales of water), but exclusive in every case of any moneys derived from the levy or collection of taxes upon any taxable property in SMUD.

**Subsidy** means any subsidy, reimbursement or other payment from the federal government of the United States of America under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (or any similar legislation or regulation of the federal government of the United States of America or any other governmental entity or extension of any such legislation or regulation).

**Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds**

The Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund (the “Reserve Fund”) is created under the Resolution. The Reserve Fund secures all Bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 that are currently outstanding (and not otherwise deemed to be paid and discharged under the Resolution) and may secure additional Bonds issued in the future. However, the Reserve Fund does not secure and will not be available to pay debt service on the 2024 Series M Bonds.

After the close of each fiscal year, SMUD shall determine the ratio (herein called the “debt service ratio”) of (1) the Net Revenues during said fiscal year to (2) the maximum annual debt service during the period of three fiscal years next following said fiscal year on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding. For this purpose, the term “maximum annual debt service” shall mean the sum of (i) the interest falling due on serial bonds and term bonds, (ii) the principal amount of serial bonds falling due by
<!-- Page 538 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
their terms, and (iii) the amount of minimum sinking fund payments required, as computed for the year in which such sum shall be a maximum. Interest during construction which has been funded and provided for shall not be included in "minimum annual debt service" for the purpose of the above calculation.

So long as the debt service ratio shall exceed 1.40, the amount required to be maintained in the Reserve Fund shall be an amount such that the amount in the combined reserve funds of all Parity Bonds then outstanding will at no time be less than the current annual interest requirements on all then outstanding Parity Bonds, except only bonds (if any) for which payment has been provided in advance. If the debt service ratio in any fiscal year shall fall below 1.40, the Treasurer shall set aside in the Reserve Fund or in any other reserve fund or funds established for any one or more issues of the Parity Bonds (on or before the first day of each month of the next succeeding fiscal year) from the first available Net Revenues an amount not less than 15% of the sum of the current monthly interest requirements of all Parity Bonds then outstanding until the next year in which the debt service ratio shall exceed 1.40 or until the aggregate amount in the combined reserve funds established for all of the Parity Bonds (including the Reserve Fund) is equal to the maximum annual debt service on all of the Parity Bonds then outstanding, whichever shall first occur.

For purposes of the above calculation, the interest rates of Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period of periods of time, such interest rate or rates for such period or periods, and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period covered by such known period or periods, the interest rate shall be the greater of the numerical maximum rate that such Bonds may vary or be adjusted to and the numerical maximum rate (if any) that the interest rate for such Bonds may be fixed to, in both cases as set forth in the supplemental resolution authorizing such Bonds, or if such rate or rates have been increased in accordance with such supplemental resolution at such increased rate or rates.

Any amount in the Reserve Fund at any time in excess of the balance required to be then maintained therein shall be released to SMUD for any SMUD use.

SMUD shall not be required, notwithstanding anything herein contained, to maintain in the combined reserve funds appertaining to all Parity Bonds of SMUD, an aggregate amount in excess of the maximum annual debt service requirements in any subsequent fiscal year on all of the then outstanding Parity Bonds.

Any moneys at any time in any of said reserve funds shall be held by the Treasurer in trust for the benefit of the holder or holders from time to time of the Bonds and the coupons appertaining thereto entitled to be paid therewith, and SMUD shall not have any beneficial right or interest in any such moneys.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Supplemental Resolution adopted after the Forty-Eighth Supplemental Resolution may provide that a Series of Bonds issued pursuant to such Supplemental Resolution shall not be secured by the Reserve Fund. In such event, (i) payments of the principal of and interest on such Bonds shall be excluded from all calculations made in respect of the amount to be maintained in the Reserve Fund and (ii) amounts on deposit in the Reserve Fund shall not be applied to the payment of the principal of or interest on such Bonds, even if no other moneys are available therefor.

any expiration or termination thereof; provided, however, that no such drawing need be made if other moneys or a letter of credit are available in the Reserve Fund in the amount of the Reserve Fund Requirement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the prior two paragraphs, if at any time that there is on deposit in the Reserve Fund a combination of cash, a letter of credit and/or a surety bond as contemplated above, SMUD shall draw first on such cash to the extent required and available, then on (1) such surety bond and letter of credit on a pro rata basis (if both a surety bond and letter of credit are available) to the extent required and available, or (2) such surety bond or letter of credit (if either a surety bond or letter of credit, but not both, is available) to the extent required and available.

For purposes of calculating the “debt service ratio” and, unless otherwise specified in a Supplemental Resolution providing for the issuance of a series of Parity Bonds, the amount required to be maintained in the Reserve Fund as described above: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Net Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

### Additional Covenants

The Resolution contains the following additional covenants, among others:

1. That the Electric System will be maintained in good repair, working order and condition at all times, and will be continuously operated in an efficient and economical manner.

2. That no electric energy shall be supplied free by SMUD, and a reasonable wholesale charge will be made for water distributed at any cost to SMUD and such charge will be deemed Revenues; but SMUD may supply without charge water furnished to it without distribution cost, and any moneys received from any retail sales of water will not be deemed Revenues.

3. That all taxes and governmental charges and other lawful claims which might become a lien on the Electric System or the Revenues or impair the security of the Bonds will be paid and discharged when due.

4. That SMUD will comply with all lawful orders of any governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction in the premises (except while the validity or application thereof is being contested in good faith) and with all necessary permits and licenses issued by the NRC.

5. That no lease or agreement will be entered into, or sale or other disposition of essential property made, that would impair the operation of the Electric System or the rights of Bondholders with respect to the Revenues; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Master Resolution, SMUD may sell or otherwise dispose of its accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD provided that SMUD delivers to the Trustee:

   (a) a Certificate of SMUD to the effect that the amount derived by SMUD from the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances is a result of the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances upon fair and reasonable terms no
<!-- Page 541 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

less favorable to SMUD than the terms of a comparable arm’s-length transaction treated as a sale and not a loan under generally accepted accounting principles; and

(b) a written statement or report of an independent certified public accountant to the effect that, based on the audited financial statements of SMUD for the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available and after giving effect to such transaction by reducing Revenues for such fiscal year by the difference between the face amount of such accounts receivable or loan balances and the amount derived by SMUD from the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances, the debt service ratio computed pursuant to the Master Resolution would not have been reduced to less than 1.40:1.0.

6. That proper records and accounts will be maintained of all transactions relating to the Electric System and the Revenues (open to inspection by the Trustee and the holders of not less than 10 percent in principal amount of the Bonds), to be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant within 90 days after close of the fiscal year, and copies of such financial statements supplied to Bondholders on request.

7. That insurance adequate in amounts and as to risks covered will be maintained against such risks as are usually insurable in connection with similar electric systems, and in addition public liability and property damage insurance in amounts not less than $1,000,000 per accident and adequate fidelity bonds on all officers and employees of SMUD handling or responsible for SMUD funds, subject in each case to the condition that such insurance is obtainable at reasonable rates and upon reasonable terms and conditions. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – INSURANCE” attached to this Official Statement for a description of such insurance.

8. That the net proceeds realized by SMUD in the event all or any part of the Electric System is taken by eminent domain proceedings will be applied to the redemption or retirement of all Bonds and Parity Bonds if sufficient therefor, and, if not, then pro rata to the redemption or retirement of Bonds and Parity Bonds or to new facilities if the additional Revenues to be derived therefrom will sufficiently offset the loss of Revenues resulting from such eminent domain so that the ability of SMUD to meet its obligations will not be substantially impaired.

9. That SMUD will at all times use its best efforts to maintain the powers, functions and duties now reposed in it pursuant to law.

10. That SMUD will establish and at all times maintain and collect rates and charges for the sale or use of its electric energy sufficient to permit SMUD to purchase power or issue and sell Bonds or Parity Bonds to finance additions, betterments, extensions and improvements to the Electric System as may be reasonably necessary to satisfy its then projected electric demand upon its Electric System, and that unless the Board determines that SMUD will be able to satisfy such demand through the purchase of electric energy, SMUD will proceed with all reasonable diligence to issue and sell such Bonds or Parity Bonds.

11. That SMUD will not create, or permit the creation of, any mortgage or lien upon the Electric System or any property essential to the proper operation of the Electric System or to the maintenance of the Revenues. SMUD will not create, or permit the creation of, any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon the Revenues except as provided in the Master Resolution; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Master Resolution, SMUD may create a pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon its accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD (which pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance shall be prior to any pledge, lien, charge or
<!-- Page 542 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

encumbrance created or made pursuant to the Master Resolution, including without limitation the pledge of Revenues made pursuant to the Master Resolution) to secure indebtedness with a term of one year or less provided that the principal amount of such indebtedness does not exceed 50% of the aggregate face amount of the accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD as shown on SMUD’s most recent audited financial statements.

## Amendment of the Resolution

The Resolution and the rights and obligations of SMUD and of the holders of the Bonds may be modified or amended at any time pursuant to the affirmative vote at a meeting of Bondholders, or with the written consent without a meeting, of the holders of 60 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding, provided that no such modification or amendment shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Bond, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Bond so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Bonds required for consent to an amendment or modification, without the consent of the holders of all the Bonds then outstanding. Modifications or amendments may be made, without the consent of any Bondholders, to add covenants of SMUD or to surrender rights reserved by SMUD in the Resolution, to cure ambiguities or defective or inconsistent provisions or in regard to questions arising under the Resolution without adversely affecting the interests of the Bondholders, or to provide for the issuance of a series of Bonds, subject to the provisions contained in the Resolution with respect thereto.

## Events of Default and Remedies of Bondholders

The Resolution declares each of the following to be an event of default:

(a) Failure to pay the principal of and premium on any Bond when due and payable;

(b) Failure to pay any installment of interest on any Bond when due and payable, if such default continues for a period of 30 days;

(c) Default by SMUD in the observance of any of the covenants, agreements or conditions on its part in the Resolution or in the Bonds, if such default continues for a period of 60 days after written notice thereof (specifying such default and requiring the same to be remedied) has been given to SMUD by the Trustee, or to SMUD and the Trustee by the holders of not less than 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time outstanding; and

(d) If, under the provisions of any law for the relief or aid of debtors, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume custody or control of SMUD or of the whole or any substantial part of its property, and such custody or control shall not be terminated or stayed within 60 days;

In the event of default, the Trustee or the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Bonds may, upon written notice to SMUD, declare the principal of all outstanding Bonds, and the interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately. The Trustee is appointed as trustee to represent Bondholders and may take such action as may seem appropriate to it, and, upon the written request of the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Bonds, and upon being furnished with indemnity satisfactory to it, will take such action on behalf of Bondholders as is specified in such written request. Each Bondholder is entitled to proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in such holder by the Resolution by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such holder deems most effectual.
<!-- Page 543 -->
![Page 9](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+9)

The rights of Bondholders are limited and restricted to the use and application of Revenues as provided in the Resolution and do not extend to the levy of any attachment or execution upon or forfeiture of any of the properties of SMUD or to any moneys derived by SMUD from the levy or collection of taxes.

In addition to the limitations on remedies contained in the Resolution, the rights and remedies provided by the Bonds and the Resolution, as well as the enforcement by SMUD of contracts with customers of the Electric System, may be limited by and are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

### Refunding of 2024 Series M Bonds

If Refunding Bonds are issued for the purpose of refunding 2024 Series M Bonds, then SMUD is authorized to apply proceeds of the sale of such Refunding Bonds to the payment of the purchase price of direct noncallable obligations of the United States of America (“Treasury Obligations”) to be held by the Trustee to insure the payment or retirement at or before maturity of all or a portion of the outstanding 2024 Series M Bonds. Upon deposit with the Trustee, in trust, of money or Treasury Obligations (including, but not limited to, direct obligations of the United States of America issued in book-entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury of the United States of America), or any combination thereof, sufficient, together with the interest to accrue on any such Treasury Obligations, to pay or redeem all or a portion of 2024 Series M Bonds then outstanding at or before their maturity date, all liability of SMUD in respect of such 2024 Series M Bonds shall cease, determine and be completely discharged, and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to payment by SMUD of the money and Treasury Obligations deposited with the Trustee for their payment. If the liability of SMUD shall cease and determine with respect to all or a portion of the 2024 Series M Bonds, then said 2024 Series M Bonds shall not be considered to be outstanding Bonds for any purpose of the Resolution.

### Discharge of Resolution

The Resolution may be discharged by depositing with the Trustee in trust, moneys or Federal Securities or general obligation bonds of the State of California, in such amount as the Trustee shall determine will, together with the interest to accrue thereon, be fully sufficient to pay and discharge the indebtedness on all Bonds at or before their respective maturity dates.

### Investment of Funds

Moneys in any fund established by the Resolution may be invested in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, bills, bankers acceptances or other securities in which funds of SMUD may be legally invested as provided by the law in effect at the time of such investment. Currently this investment authority includes, among other things, the Local Agency Investment Fund which is administered by the Treasurer of the State of California for the investment of funds belonging to local agencies in the State of California.

## PROPOSED FORM OF LEGAL OPINION FOR 2024 SERIES M BONDS

[Closing Date]  
Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Sacramento, California  

Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M  
(Final Opinion)  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) in connection with the issuance of $ __________ aggregate principal amount of Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M (the “2024 Series M Bonds”), issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 of the Board of Directors of SMUD, adopted January 7, 1971 (the “Master Resolution”), as supplemented and amended by later resolutions of said Board of Directors (as so supplemented and amended, the “Resolution”), including Resolution No. 24-03-[__], adopted March 21, 2024 (the “Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Resolution; the Tax Certificate, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”), executed by SMUD; opinions of counsel to SMUD and the Trustee; certificates of SMUD, the Trustee and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after original delivery of the 2024 Series M Bonds on the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after original delivery of the 2024 Series M Bonds on the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters. Our engagement with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds has concluded with their issuance, and we disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures provided to us and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than SMUD. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to in the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes.

or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against governmental entities such as SMUD in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the property described in or as subject to the lien of the Resolution or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein of, or the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such property. Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official Statement, dated ______, 2024, or other offering material relating to the 2024 Series M Bonds and express no opinion or view with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1. The 2024 Series M Bonds constitute the valid and binding obligations of SMUD.

2. The Resolution, including the Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, has been duly adopted by, and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of, SMUD. The Resolution creates a valid pledge, to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds, of the Net Revenues, subject to the provisions of the Resolution permitting the application thereof for the purposes on the terms and conditions set forth in the Resolution.

3. Interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. We observe that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series M Bonds.

Faithfully yours,

**NEW ISSUE - FULL BOOK-ENTRY**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD, based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and, assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series N Bonds.

amount of $[________] are expected to be outstanding under the Resolution. See "PLAN OF FINANCE."

Although the Resolution establishes an “Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund” (the “Reserve Fund”), the Reserve Fund does not secure and will not be available to pay debt service on the 2024 Series N Bonds. The Reserve Fund secures all Bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 that are currently outstanding (and not otherwise deemed to be paid and discharged under the Resolution) and may secure additional Bonds issued in the future.

U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association serves as trustee and paying agent under the Resolution (in such capacities, the “Trustee” and the “Paying Agent” respectively).

From time to time, SMUD issues Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the “Subordinate Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 were outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of the Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series N Bonds).

SMUD also issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of December 31, 2023, Notes in the principal amount of $150,000,000 were outstanding. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal, premium if any, and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series N Bonds) and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. SMUD expects to pay all $150,000,000 of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes with a portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds. See "PLAN OF FINANCE."

SMUD has also previously issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes pursuant to a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”). As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future. SMUD’s payment obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series N Bonds) and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

SMUD is responsible for the acquisition, generation, transmission and distribution of electric power to its service area, which includes most of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD served a population of approximately 1.5 million with a total annual retail load of approximately 10,104 million kilowatt hours (“kWh”). SMUD

* Preliminary, subject to change.

owns and operates an electric system which, as of December 31, 2023, included generating facilities owned and operated by SMUD with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 775 megawatts (“MW”), local gas-fired plants owned and operated by a joint powers authority and managed by SMUD with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 1,087 MW, over which SMUD has exclusive control of dispatch, and purchased power with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 1,590 MW and transmission and distribution facilities. SMUD’s power requirements exceed its generating capacity and thus SMUD has agreements with others (including the Local Gas-Fired Plants as defined in APPENDIX A) for the purchase of a portion of its power requirements. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Supply Resources.” Continuing development of SMUD’s business strategy in response to changing environmental and regulatory requirements has had, and is expected to continue to have, a major effect on SMUD’s power supply planning. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – BUSINESS STRATEGY.”

Pursuant to a Continuing Disclosure Agreement, dated the date of issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds (the “Continuing Disclosure Agreement”) between SMUD and the Trustee, SMUD will covenant for the benefit of the holders of the 2024 Series N Bonds and owners of beneficial interest in the 2024 Series N Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data and to provide certain notices. See “CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING” and APPENDIX F – “FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.”

The information presented in this Introduction is qualified in its entirety by reference to this entire Official Statement and the documents summarized or described herein. This Official Statement, including the Appendices, presents certain information regarding the Bonds, the Resolution and certain agreements, contracts and other arrangements, some of which currently exist and others of which may exist in the future. The summaries and references to all documents, statutes, regulations and other instruments referred to herein do not purport to be complete, comprehensive or definitive, and each such summary and reference is qualified in its entirety by reference to each such document, statute, regulation or instrument.

PLAN OF FINANCE

Issuance of 2024 Series N Bonds and Refunding of Refunded Bonds

The proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds will be used to (i) refund the $200,000,000 outstanding principal amount of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”), (ii) refund the $250,000,000 outstanding principal amount of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series V (the “2010 Series V Bonds” and, together with the 2009 Series V Bonds, the “Refunded Bonds”) and (iii) pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds.

The Refunded Bonds were issued as bonds designated as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Recovery Act”). At the time the Refunded Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive cash subsidy payments from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the Refunded Bonds as required by sections 54AA and 6431 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (as such sections were

![Document](https://emmas.msrb.org/EA393164-EA308929-EA704612.pdf)  

The 2009 Series V Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption upon the occurrence of an “Extraordinary Event.” Pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions for the 2009 Series V Bonds, an “Extraordinary Event” will have occurred if SMUD determines that a material adverse change has occurred to Section 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as such Sections were added by Section 1531 of the Recovery Act, pertaining to Build America Bonds) or there is any guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury with respect to such Sections or any other determination by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury, which determination is not the result of an act or omission by SMUD to satisfy the requirements to receive the 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury, pursuant to which SMUD’s 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury is reduced or eliminated.

The 2010 Series W Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption upon the occurrence of a “Tax Law Change.” Pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions for the 2010 Bonds, “Tax Law Change” means legislation has been enacted by the Congress of the United States or passed by either House of the Congress, or a decision has been rendered by a court of the United States, or an order, ruling, regulation (final, proposed or official) that has been made by or on behalf of the Treasury Department of the United States, the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental agency of appropriate jurisdiction, the effect of which, as reasonably determined by SMUD, would be to suspend, reduce or terminate the payment from the United States Treasury to SMUD with respect to the 2010 Series W Bonds, or to state or local governmental issuers generally with respect to obligations of the general character of the 2010 Series W Bonds, pursuant to Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code of an amount equal to 35% of the interest due thereon on each interest payment date (the “Subsidy Payments”); provided, that such suspension, reduction or termination of the Subsidy Payments is not due to a failure by the District to comply with the requirements under the Code to receive such Subsidy Payments.

The extraordinary optional redemption provisions for each series of the Refunded Bonds are described in the related Official Statement for such series of Refunded Bonds. The Official Statements for the Refunded Bonds can be found at the following links:

2009 Series V Bonds: [Link](https://emmas.msrb.org/FP250561-EP406639-EP803941.pdf)  
2010 Series W Bonds: [Link](https://emmas.msrb.org/EA393164-EA308929-EA704612.pdf)  

The foregoing links are provided for reference and convenience only. The Official Statements for the Refunded Bonds are not incorporated herein by reference and do not constitute part of this Official Statement.

For various reasons, including but not limited to, the enactment of the Budget Control Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act and the resulting reduction of the cash subsidy payments required to be paid by the United States Treasury to SMUD with respect to the Refunded Bonds pursuant to section 6431 of the Code, SMUD has determined that an “Extraordinary Event” has occurred with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and that a “Tax Law Change” has occurred with respect to the 2010 Series W Bonds. Therefore,
<!-- Page 567 -->
SMUD expects to redeem the Refunded Bonds pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions applicable to each series of the Refunded Bonds.

[A portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds, [together with other available funds], will be deposited in one or more escrow funds (the “Escrow Funds”) established under one or more escrow agreements between SMUD and the Trustee. The moneys so deposited will be invested in direct obligations of the United States of America (the “Federal Securities”), the interest on and principal of which, together with other moneys held in the Escrow Funds, are expected to be in an amount sufficient to pay the interest on the Refunded Bonds due on [____] (the “Redemption Date”) and to redeem the Refunded Bonds on the Redemption Date at their respective redemption prices. [Upon deposit, all liability of SMUD with respect to the Refunded Bonds (except for the obligation of SMUD to pay the redemption price and interest on the Refunded Bonds from moneys on deposit in the Escrow Fund) will cease. The holders of the Refunded Bonds will be entitled to payment from SMUD solely from moneys or Federal Securities on deposit in the Escrow Fund, and the Refunded Bonds will no longer be outstanding under the Resolution.] [Notwithstanding the deposit to the Escrow Funds, the Refunded Bonds will remain outstanding, and SMUD will remain liable for the payment of the principal and redemption price of and interest on the Refunded Bonds, until the Refunded Bonds are actually redeemed in full on the Redemption Date.] The Federal Securities and moneys in the Escrow Funds will not secure the 2024 Series N Bonds and will not be available to pay the principal of or interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds.]

[A portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds, [together with other available funds], will be used to pay the interest on the Refunded Bonds due on [____] (the “Redemption Date”) and to redeem the Refunded Bonds on the Redemption Date at their respective redemption prices.]

The issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds and the refunding of the Refunded Bonds are components of the Plan of Finance, as further described below. The issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds is not contingent upon the implementation of the other components of the Plan of Finance, and SMUD is not obligated to implement any of the components of the Plan of Finance.

**Issuance of 2024 Series M Bonds**

Concurrently with the issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds, SMUD expects to issue approximately $[____]1 aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Series M Bonds. The proceeds of the 2024 Series M Bonds are expected to be used to finance and refinance certain improvements and additions to SMUD’s Electric System, including by paying the outstanding principal amount of SMUD’s commercial paper notes at maturity, [and pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds].

# THE 2024 SERIES N BONDS

The 2024 Series N Bonds will mature in the years and amounts and bear interest at the rates set forth on the inside cover page hereof. Interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds will accrue from the date of delivery of the 2024 Series N Bonds, and will be payable on [November 15, 2024], and semiannually thereafter on each [May 15 and November 15] (each, an “Interest Payment Date”) to the owners thereof as of the first day of the month (whether or not such day is a Business Day) in which an Interest Payment Date occurs (each, a “Record Date”).

The 2024 Series N Bonds will be issued in fully registered form and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). DTC will act as securities depository (the “Securities Depository”) for the 2024 Series N Bonds. Individual purchases of interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds will be made in book-entry form only, in the principal amount of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. Purchasers of such interests will not receive certificates representing their interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds. Principal and interest are payable directly to the Securities Depository by the Trustee. Upon receipt of payments of principal and interest, the Securities Depository will in turn remit such principal and interest to the Securities Depository’s Direct Participants (as such term is hereinafter defined) for subsequent disbursement to the purchasers of interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.”

**Selection of Bonds for Redemption.** If less than all of a maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the 2024 Series N Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed, from the Outstanding 2024 Series N Bonds of such maturity not previously called for redemption, by lot in any manner the Trustee deems fair. For so long as the book-entry system is in effect with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds, DTC shall select the 2024 Series N Bonds to be redeemed in accordance with the procedures of DTC.

**Notice of Redemption.** Notice of redemption for the 2024 Series N Bonds will be given by publication at least once in financial newspapers or journals, selected by the Trustee, of general circulation in San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, each such publication to be not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption, if at any time the 2024 Series N Bonds are not in book entry form. Notice will also be mailed to the registered owners of any 2024 Series N Bonds designated for redemption, but failure to mail such notice or any defect therein with respect to any particular 2024 Series N Bond will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other 2024 Series N Bonds. For so long as the book-entry system is in effect with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds, the Trustee will mail notice of redemption solely to DTC or its nominee or its successor. Any failure of DTC or its successor, or of a direct or indirect DTC participant, to notify a beneficial owner of a 2024 Series N Bond of any redemption will not affect the sufficiency or validity of the redemption of any 2024 Series N Bond. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.” SMUD may instruct the Trustee to give conditional notice of optional redemption, which may be conditioned upon the receipt of moneys or any other event.

# SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

## General

The principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds, together with other Parity Bonds, are payable exclusively from, and are secured by a pledge (effected in the manner and to the extent provided in the Resolution) of, the Net Revenues of the Electric System of SMUD.

Neither the credit nor the taxing power of SMUD is pledged to the payment of the Bonds and the general fund of SMUD is not liable for the payment thereof. The owners of the Bonds cannot compel the exercise of any taxing power of SMUD or the forfeiture of any of its property. The Bonds are not a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any of SMUD’s property (including the Electric System) or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues except the Net Revenues of the Electric System to the extent of the pledge thereof contained in the Resolution.

## Consent to Amendments to the Resolution

The purchasers of the 2024 Series N Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series N Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution (the “Proposed Amendments”). Such amendments are described in bold italic font herein under “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Rates and Charges” and “– Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues” and in APPENDIX D – “SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION – Certain Definitions” and “– Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds.” The written consents to the Proposed Amendments of the holders and registered owners of at least 60% of the Bonds outstanding have been filed with SMUD or the Trustee, as required by the Resolution. However, while certain Bonds remain outstanding, SMUD must also obtain the written consents of certain bond insurers to implement the Proposed Amendments. SMUD expects to implement the Proposed Amendments when the written consents of such bond insurers are obtained or

![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)

when the Bonds insured by such bond insurers are no longer outstanding. The final maturity date of the insured Bonds is July 1, 2024.

**Allocation of Revenues**

After making an allocation of Revenues to Maintenance and Operation Costs and to Energy Payments not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs, the Treasurer of SMUD is required (subject to the last paragraph of this section) to set aside, on an equal priority with sums set aside for all other Parity Bonds, Net Revenues as follows:

**First:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Interest Fund, in approximately equal monthly installments on or before the first day of each month, an amount equal to at least one-fifth (1/5) of the aggregate amount of interest becoming due on the Bonds on the next succeeding semiannual interest payment date, until an amount sufficient to meet said interest payment is accumulated.

**Second:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Redemption Fund, to be set aside in the Principal Account and Sinking Fund, respectively, in approximately equal monthly installments on or before the first day of each month, an amount equal to at least one-tenth (1/10) of the aggregate amount of principal becoming due on serial Bonds and the aggregate minimum sinking fund payments required to be made with respect to term Bonds during the next ensuing 12 months, until an amount sufficient to meet the principal and sinking fund requirements on all Bonds outstanding is accumulated in said accounts, respectively.

**Third:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund, such amounts as any supplemental resolution authorizing the issuance of a series of Bonds may require to build up and maintain said fund.

If interest on Bonds of a series or maturity is payable more frequently than semiannually, the Treasurer of SMUD shall set aside out of Net Revenues in the Interest Fund such amounts as may be required to pay interest on the Bonds of such series or maturity on each interest payment date at least one month prior to such interest payment date. Allocation to the Electric Revenue Bond Redemption Fund and Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund shall be made as set forth above.

All remaining Revenues, after making the foregoing allocations, will be available to SMUD for all lawful SMUD purposes.

From time to time, SMUD may deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund from such remaining Revenues such amounts as SMUD shall determine, provided that deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund from remaining Revenues in any fiscal year may be made until (but not after) the date 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. SMUD may withdraw amounts from the Rate Stabilization Fund only for inclusion in Revenues for any fiscal year, such withdrawals to be made until (but not after) 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. All interest or other earnings upon deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be withdrawn therefrom and accounted for as Revenues. No deposit of Revenues to the Rate Stabilization Fund may be made to the extent such Revenues were included in any certificate submitted in connection with the issuance of additional bonds and withdrawal of the Revenues from the Revenues employed in rendering said certificate would have caused noncompliance with the additional bond provisions or to the extent withdrawals of the Revenues for any fiscal year would have reduced the debt provisions.
<!-- Page 572 -->

service ratio for such fiscal year to or below 1.40:1.00. See APPENDIX A – “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” for a description of the balance in the Rate Stabilization Fund.

With respect to Bonds of a series issued on or after October 1, 2003 (including the 2024 Series N Bonds), notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Bonds of such series or maturity are outstanding, the supplemental resolution authorizing the issuance of such series shall require the Treasurer, out of Net Revenues received by SMUD, to set aside in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, such amounts as may be required so that an amount equal to the amount of principal and/or interest becoming due and payable on the Bonds of such series or maturity on each interest payment date and principal payment date is on deposit in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, at such time on or prior to such interest payment date or principal payment date as shall be specified in the supplemental resolution authorizing such Bonds.

**Rates and Charges**

SMUD has covenanted in the Resolution to establish and at all times maintain and collect rates and charges for the sale or use of electric energy generated, transmitted, distributed or furnished by SMUD which, together with certain items of other income permitted under the Resolution, will yield Revenues at least sufficient, with respect to the ensuing 12 months, to pay and provide for all sums required for Maintenance and Operation Costs and Energy Payments not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs and, in addition, to provide an aggregate sum equal to at least 1.20 times the total amount required for the payment of principal and interest, together with any sinking fund or reserve fund payments, on the Bonds and all Parity Bonds, in each case during such 12 months.

For purposes of the calculations of payments to be made under the Resolution, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, if a Financial Products Agreement has been entered into by SMUD with respect to any Parity Bonds, interest on such Parity Bonds shall be included in the calculation of such principal and interest by including for each fiscal year or period an amount equal to the amount of interest payable on such Parity Bonds in such fiscal year or period at the rate or rates stated in such Parity Bonds plus any Financial Product Payments payable in such fiscal year or period minus any Financial Product Receipts receivable in such fiscal year or period; provided that in no event shall any calculation made pursuant to this clause result in a number less than zero being included in the calculation of such principal and interest.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, Excluded Principal Payments shall be disregarded (but interest on the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payments relate shall be included until but not after the stated due date when principal payments on such Parity Bonds are scheduled by their terms to commence) and Assumed Principal Payments and Assumed Interest Payments shall be included; and for purposes of the above calculations of interest on Parity Bonds, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

4. Revenue bonds junior and subordinate to the Bonds and Parity Bonds.

For purposes of the above calculations, Excluded Principal Payments shall be disregarded (but interest on the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payments relate shall be included until but not after the stated due date when principal payments on such Parity Bonds are scheduled by their terms to commence) and Assumed Principal Payments and Assumed Interest Payments shall be included; and for purposes of the above calculations of interest on Parity Bonds, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds, if a Financial Products Agreement has been entered into by SMUD with respect to any Parity Bonds, interest on such Parity Bonds shall be included in the calculation of such principal and interest by including for each fiscal year or period an amount equal to the amount of interest payable on such Parity Bonds in such fiscal year or period at the rate or rates stated in such Parity Bonds plus any Financial Product Payments payable in such fiscal year or period minus any Financial Product Receipts receivable in such fiscal year or period; provided that in no event shall any calculation made pursuant to this clause result in a number less than zero being included in the calculation of such principal and interest.

For purposes of the calculations specified in this section: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Net Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Estimated Capital Requirements” for a description of SMUD’s projected capital requirements. Such capital requirements may be satisfied through the issuance of additional Bonds or Parity Bonds.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments” for a description of the current Subsidy that SMUD receives with respect to the Refunded Bonds.

See APPENDIX D hereto for the definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this section.

![Financial Statements and Tax Matters](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Financial+Statements+and+Tax+Matters)

**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

SMUD’s audited, consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are included in APPENDIX B attached to this Official Statement. These financial statements have been audited by Baker Tilly US, LLP, Madison, Wisconsin (the “Auditor”), for the periods indicated and to the extent set forth in their report thereon and should be read in their entirety. SMUD has not requested nor did it obtain permission from the Auditor to include the audited, consolidated financial statements as an appendix to this Official Statement. Accordingly, the Auditor has not performed any procedures to review the financial condition or operations of SMUD subsequent to the date of its report included therein, nor has it reviewed any information contained in this Official Statement.

**TAX MATTERS**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series N Bonds. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in APPENDIX E hereto.

To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of such 2024 Series N Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the term of such 2024 Series N Bonds), the difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of which, to the extent properly allocable to each Beneficial Owner thereof, is treated as interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and exempt from State of California personal income taxes. For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is the first price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is sold to the public (excluding bond brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds accrues daily over the term to maturity of such 2024 Series N Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original issue discount is added to the adjusted basis of such 2024 Series N Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon trade or business disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment at maturity) of such 2024 Series N Bonds. Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of 2024 Series N Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of Beneficial Owners who do not purchase such 2024 Series N Bonds in the original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such 2024 Series N Bonds is sold to the public.

2024 Series N Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than their principal amount payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier call date) (“Premium Bonds”) will be treated as having amortizable bond premium. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the case of bonds, like the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is
<!-- Page 578 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Page+16) 

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the 2024 Series N Bonds. SMUD has made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken), or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the 2024 Series N Bonds. Accordingly, the opinion of Bond Counsel is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters.

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of amounts treated as interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds may otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial Owner’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may cause interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent Beneficial Owners from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals or clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the 2024 Series N Bonds. Prospective purchasers of the 2024 Series N Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the 2024 Series N Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of SMUD, or about the effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. SMUD has covenanted, however, to comply with the requirements of the Code.

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds ends with the issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds, and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend SMUD or the Beneficial Owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the 2024 Series N Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, Beneficial Owners would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in
<!-- Page 579 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)

connection with an audit examination of tax-exempt bonds is difficult, obtaining an independent review of IRS positions with which SMUD legitimately disagrees may not be practicable. Any action of the IRS, including but not limited to selection of the 2024 Series N Bonds for audit, or the course or result of such audit, or an audit of bonds presenting similar tax issues may affect the market price for, or the marketability of, the 2024 Series N Bonds, and may cause SMUD or the Beneficial Owners to incur significant expense.

Payments on the 2024 Series N Bonds generally will be subject to U.S. information reporting and possibly to “backup withholding.” Under Section 3406 of the Code and applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, a non-corporate Beneficial Owner of 2024 Series N Bonds may be subject to backup withholding with respect to “reportable payments,” which include interest paid on the 2024 Series N Bonds and the gross proceeds of a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of the 2024 Series N Bonds. The payor will be required to deduct and withhold the prescribed amounts if (i) the payee fails to furnish a U.S. taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the payor in the manner required, (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect, (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the Code or (iv) the payee fails to certify under penalty of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding under Section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Code. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a Beneficial Owner’s federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Certain Beneficial Owners (including among others, corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations) are not subject to backup withholding.

# INTRODUCTION

## General

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) owns and operates an electric system that has provided retail electric service since 1946. SMUD’s current service area is approximately 900 square miles, and includes the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. See “THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM – The Service Area.”

## Independent Governance

SMUD is an independently run community-owned organization. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government.

SMUD is governed by a Board of Directors (the “Board”), which consists of seven directors elected by ward for staggered four-year terms. The Board determines policy and appoints the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, who is responsible for SMUD’s overall management and day-to-day operations. The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager is responsible for the hiring and removal of all employees, other than the Chief Legal and Government Affairs Officer and General Counsel, the Internal Auditor and the Special Assistant to the Board, who are hired and may be removed only by the Board. The employment status of nearly all SMUD employees is governed by a civil service system administered by the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager.

The Board elects its President and Vice President annually to take office in January. The current members of the Board are as follows:

| Name                     | Occupation                                               | Ward  | Term Expires     |

The Electric System

SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities.

SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through a 230 kilovolt (“kV”) and 115 kV transmission system. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) and the Western Area Power Administration (“WAPA”). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system with the exception of the City’s downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission system. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV substations with overhead and underground 12 kV distribution circuits.

SMUD’s Board of Directors has established the following purpose and vision statements: “SMUD’s purpose is to enhance the quality of life for our customers and community by providing reliable and affordable electricity, and leading the transition to a clean energy future. SMUD’s vision is to be a trusted and powerful partner in achieving an inclusive, zero carbon economy. SMUD will leverage its relationships to accelerate innovation, ensure energy affordability and reliability, protect the environment, eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, catalyze economic and workforce development, promote environmental justice, and enhance community vitality for all.” The Board has adopted a set of Strategic Directions with related metrics, which it considers essential for the success of SMUD and for serving SMUD’s customers. These include competitive rates, access to credit markets, reliability, customer relations, environmental leadership, resource planning, enterprise risk management and safety. Some of the general elements in SMUD’s business strategy are:

- developing and maintaining a sustainable and reliable power supply to meet demand growth consistent with State mandates and the Board’s directions for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions to zero by 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”;
- working closely with customers to provide the information, tools and incentives to assist them to more efficiently manage energy use, which will contribute to meeting greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission targets and managing needle peak demand requirements (those 40 or so hours of the year with extreme temperatures when customer demand surges by up to 400 additional MW);
- managing price, volumetric and credit risks associated with energy and natural gas procurement;
- attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, skilled and engaged workforce that reflects SMUD’s values and is committed to achieving SMUD’s mission;
- retaining local decision making authority and operational independence; and
- collaborating regionally to attract new businesses and grow existing business to diversify and strengthen the Sacramento economy.

SMUD’s long-range business strategy focuses in part on ensuring financial stability by establishing rates that provide an acceptable fixed charge coverage ratio on a consolidated basis, taking into consideration the impact of capital expenditures and other factors on cash flow.

with current energy market prices. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges.”

**Renewable Options.** SMUD’s customers have been increasingly interested in distributed energy resources, mainly through the installation of solar systems. As of December 2023, approximately 51,374 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, approximately 8% of retail customers, had installed solar systems, representing approximately 360 MW of solar installations.

As the cost of energy storage continues to decline, SMUD anticipates an increase in behind-the-meter energy storage, mainly through the installation of battery storage systems. As of December 2023, approximately 1,532 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, had installed storage systems, representing approximately 10 MW of storage.

As another option for solar, SMUD’s SolarShares® pilot program (the “SolarShares Pilot”) was established as a cost-effective and convenient way for commercial customers to meet their energy needs from solar power. The SolarShares Pilot offered SMUD commercial customers the opportunity to receive solar power without upfront costs or equipment installation through 5-, 10- or 20-year purchase contracts. Customers that entered into purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot receive up to half of their power from a utility-scale solar system. SMUD supplies solar power for the SolarShares Pilot either by building and maintaining utility-scale solar systems or by procuring solar power from third parties through power purchase agreements. The SolarShares Pilot generation was approximately 3.2% of retail sales in 2023. As of April 30, 2021, SMUD had completed the SolarShares Pilot and is not entering into new purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot.

Since January 2020, the California Building Code has required all new constructed residential buildings under three stories to be powered by photovoltaic solar systems. A new home satisfies this requirement if it installs on-site solar or participates in an approved community solar or energy storage program. In February 2020, SMUD obtained approval from the California Energy Commission (“CEC”) to administer its own community solar program, called Neighborhood SolarShares® (“Neighborhood SolarShares”). SMUD’s Neighborhood SolarShares program can be used by developers of new low-rise residential buildings to satisfy the mandatory solar requirement. See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Rooftop Solar Mandate.” Starting in 2023, the California Building Code’s mandatory solar requirement extends beyond low-rise residential properties, and other changes to the California Building Code’s community solar regulations took effect. SMUD revised its program to align with the new regulations and, in May 2023, obtained approval from the CEC to continue offering its Neighborhood SolarShares compliance option to newly constructed low rise residential homes in its service territory.

In addition to the SolarShares Pilot and Neighborhood SolarShares, SMUD maintains a voluntary green energy pricing program called Greenergy® (“Greenery”). The Greenery program allows customers the opportunity to pay an additional amount per month to ensure that either all or part of their electricity comes from green or carbon free energy sources. In 2023, the program allocated Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) equivalent to approximately 4.2% of retail sales to its participating customers.

**Energy Efficiency.** To further assist customers in managing energy usage and reducing regional carbon emissions and air pollution, SMUD offers an extensive array of energy efficiency and building electrification programs and services including financial incentives, loans, energy audits and education. In addition, SMUD has partnered with local developers to incorporate energy efficiency and all-electric construction measures into new residential and commercial construction, which helps developers plan and design efficient, cost-effective and low or zero-emission buildings. As part of SMUD’s 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), SMUD set a goal for regional carbon emissions through transport and building

# Electrification and Sustainable Power Supply

**Electrification Goals**  
SMUD’s focus on electrification aims to reduce carbon emissions in buildings and transport by 64% over the next 20 years. SMUD was the first electric utility in the country to set its efficiency goals based on carbon reductions, allowing building electrification and energy efficiency to both count toward meeting SMUD’s efficiency goals. This is a significant opportunity, as converting a typical home today to all-electric saves more than three times the carbon emissions compared to doing a major energy efficiency upgrade alone to the same building. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources.”

## Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission

Maintaining a sustainable power supply entails focusing efforts on researching, promoting and implementing new renewable energy technologies and sources to meet SMUD’s long-term commitment to reducing carbon emissions and providing a reliable energy supply. SMUD defines a sustainable power supply as one that reduces SMUD’s GHG emissions to serve retail customer load to zero by 2030. See “– 2030 Zero Carbon Plan” below. SMUD is planning to achieve zero GHG emissions to serve retail customer load through investments in energy efficiency, clean distributed energy resources, renewables portfolio standard (“RPS”) eligible renewables, energy storage, large hydroelectric generation, clean and emissions free fuels, carbon capture and sequestration, and new technologies and business models. Additionally, SMUD plans to continue pursuing GHG emissions reductions through vehicle, building and equipment electrification. At the same time, SMUD’s plans for maintaining a sustainable power supply include assuring the reliability of SMUD’s electric system, minimizing environmental impacts on land, habitat, water and air quality, and maintaining competitive rates relative to other electric providers in the State.

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills regulate GHG emissions and promote sustainable generation alternatives, principally through more stringent RPS. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings” herein.

### 2030 Zero Carbon Plan

In July 2020, the Board declared a climate emergency and adopted a resolution calling for SMUD to take significant and consequential actions to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030. On April 28, 2021, the Board approved SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (the “Zero Carbon Plan”). The Zero Carbon Plan is intended to be a flexible roadmap for SMUD to eliminate carbon emissions from its electricity production by 2030 while maintaining reliable and affordable service. To achieve these goals the Zero Carbon Plan is focused on four main areas: natural gas generation repurposing, proven technologies, new technologies and business models and financial impacts and options. SMUD plans to revisit the Zero Carbon Plan annually.

The natural gas generation repurposing focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for exploring the replacement of two of SMUD’s five Local Gas-Fired Plants (as defined herein) and the retooling of the other three Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” Based on SMUD’s studies to date, SMUD estimates that McClellan (as defined herein) and the Campbell Soup Project (as defined herein) can be replaced in the next several years depending on SMUD’s success with replacement resources. Final decisions about the replacement of these two Local Gas-Fired Plants will be based on additional reliability studies and engagement with the community. As part of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is also exploring converting the Carson Project (as defined herein) and the Procter & Gamble Project (as defined herein) to reliability use operations only and investigating the use of alternative fuels like Renewable Natural Gas-biomethane (RNG-biomanthene), hydrogen and other biofuels for the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, and the Consumers Power Plant (as defined herein). In addition, SMUD is investigating new technologies such as long duration energy storage, carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and other clean fuel alternatives to help support.

**A-9**

The reduction of GHG emissions in SMUD’s energy supply. All final generator configurations are subject to reliability assessments.

The proven clean technologies focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for SMUD to procure approximately 1,100 to 1,500 MW of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (“PV”) generating capacity, 700 to 1,100 MW of local utility-scale battery storage, 300 to 500 MW of wind generating capacity, and 100 to 220 MW of geothermal generating capacity. The Zero Carbon Plan also estimates that customer installation of approximately 500 to 750 MW of behind-the-meter solar PV generating capacity and approximately 50 to 250 MW of behind-the-meter battery storage will assist SMUD with achieving the Zero Carbon Plan goals.

With respect to new technologies and business models, the Zero Carbon Plan focuses on evaluating, prioritizing and scaling the emerging technologies that SMUD expects will have the largest impact on reducing carbon in SMUD’s 2030 resource mix. SMUD is currently focused on various areas of technology and customer-focused programs, including electrification, demand flexibility, virtual power plants, vehicle-to-grid technology, and new grid-scale technologies. The Zero Carbon Plan forecasts that customer-owned devices and SMUD customer-focused programs will contribute between 360 and 1,300 MW of capacity to SMUD’s grid by 2030.

The financial impacts and options focus of the Zero Carbon Plan aims to keep SMUD rate increases at or below the rate of inflation while achieving SMUD’s goal of eliminating carbon emissions from its power supply by 2030. To pay for the expected costs of the Zero Carbon Plan and keep rate increases at or below the rate of inflation, the Zero Carbon Plan estimates the need for SMUD to realize between $50 million and $150 million of sustained annual savings. SMUD currently plans to achieve these sustained annual savings by exploring the implementation of operational savings and pursuing partnership and grant opportunities.

While the ultimate impacts of the Zero Carbon Plan on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy from clean technologies, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers, such impacts could be material.

**Renewable Energy and Climate Change.** The California Renewable Energy Resources Act, established by Senate Bill X1-2 (“SBX1-2”) and the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, enacted by Senate Bill 350 (“SB 350”) require that SMUD meets 33% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2020 and 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2030. Senate Bill 100 (“SB 100”), passed by the legislature and approved by then-Governor Brown on September 10, 2018, accelerates the RPS targets and establishes a new 60% target by 2030. The bill also created a planning goal to meet all of the State’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Renewables Portfolio Standards” for a discussion of the State RPS requirements.

SMUD’s compliance with State RPS requirements is evaluated over 3- or 4-year compliance periods. SMUD met the State RPS requirements for the first compliance period (2011-2013) and second compliance period (2014-2016). The third compliance period (2017-2020) required SMUD to source one-third of its energy from renewable resources, and SMUD had sufficient RECs to meet the third compliance period requirements. SMUD filed its 2020 and third compliance period RPS compliance report with the CEC in the second quarter of 2021 and the CEC adopted SMUD’s third compliance period verification report in December 2023. SMUD expects the confirmation letter from the CEC indicating that SMUD was

in full compliance with its third compliance period RPS obligations in the first quarter of 2024. As of the end of the third compliance period (2020), SMUD had approximately one million surplus RECs available to help meet future RPS targets. SMUD expects to file its 2023 RPS compliance report by July 1, 2024, showing that SMUD will have provided approximately 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources in 2023, which is greater than the interim 2023 RPS target of 41.25%. RPS compliance is determined by compliance period and not by individual years and SMUD anticipates having sufficient surplus procured and/or under contract resources in the fourth compliance period (2021-2024) to be in compliance with the RPS requirements. In addition to meeting RPS standards, SMUD serves an additional 7.4% of its customer load with renewable energy through its voluntary SolarShares and Greenergy pricing programs described above. SMUD estimates that it has sufficient renewable energy deliveries, new power supply contract commitments, new power supply commitments under active discussion, and RPS-eligible surplus carryover to meet its RPS requirements through 2025. Additional resources have been identified that are expected to provide sufficient RPS-eligible resources to cover most of SMUD’s RPS requirements through 2030. Future solicitations may be needed to fill any remaining gaps. The following chart illustrates SMUD’s current RPS requirements through 2030 and its existing and committed resources utilized to meet those requirements.

In addition to procuring new sources, meeting the RPS requirements will require replacement of certain existing renewable contracts which expire in future years. While SMUD anticipates it will meet much of its renewable resource requirements through purchased contracts with third parties, it continues to explore additional options, including wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal developments, partnering with other utilities on future projects, and local development options. SMUD’s resource forecast (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources”) accounts for future renewable resources as a component of “Uncommitted Purchases.” To meet SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan goals, SMUD anticipates meeting loads in 2030 with approximately 70-80% renewable resources, in addition to hydro and other new zero carbon technologies. See “← 2030 Zero Carbon Plan” above.

Given the intermittent nature of power from renewable resources such as wind and solar, SMUD is exploring and investing in options that provide the flexibility to manage the intermittency of such renewable resources. Potential options include energy storage resources, which SMUD has committed to as part of the Zero Carbon Plan, and expanding load management resources. Additionally, on April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its membership in BANC, a joint exercise of powers agency formed in 2009, and currently comprised of SMUD, the Modesto Irrigation District (“MID”), the City of Roseville (“Roseville”), the City of Redding (“Redding”), the City of Shasta Lake and the Trinity Public Utilities District, commenced participation in the California Independent System Operator Corporation (“CAISO”) western energy imbalance market (“WEIM”). Participation in the WEIM benefits SMUD by providing it with broader access to balancing resources within the region to help manage its expanding renewable portfolio. In addition, other entities within the BANC Balancing Authority Area began participation in the WEIM on March 25, 2021. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Operational Independence and Local Control” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

In 2022, SMUD’s Board formally adopted the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan as SMUD’s updated IRP. SMUD filed the approved IRP update with the CEC on September 14, 2022, pursuant to the CEC’s guidelines, which called for updating SMUD’s IRP filing within five years of SMUD’s previous filing of April 29, 2019. SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan built upon the April 2019 IRP and set a goal for zero carbon emissions by 2030. SMUD’s next formal IRP process is expected to be completed and filed with the CEC in 2027. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

The State’s carbon cap-and-trade market established pursuant to Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”) began in 2013. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Greenhouse Gas Emissions” for a discussion of AB 32 and the State’s cap-and-trade program. SMUD anticipates that allowances allocated to SMUD will nearly equal SMUD’s compliance obligations under normal water year conditions. Under low water year conditions, SMUD may need to purchase additional allowances to cover its compliance obligations, including carbon obligations related to wholesale energy sales from SMUD’s natural gas power plants. As SMUD implements its clean power goals, SMUD expects its need for these allowances to decline.

There is scientific consensus that increasing concentrations of GHG have caused and will continue to cause a rise in temperatures in the State and around the world. The change in the earth’s average atmospheric temperature, generally referred to as “climate change,” is, among other things, expected to result in a wide range of changes in climate patterns, including increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including droughts and heat waves, more frequent incidences of wildfires, changes in wind patterns, sea level rise and flooding, any of which alone or in combination could materially adversely affect SMUD’s financial results or operations. See also “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION” and “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY – Other Factors.” As described above, SMUD is actively working to meet its sustainable power supply goals.

reduce its own GHG emissions, and assist the local governments in the territory it serves with their desired GHG reductions. In 2016, SMUD introduced the Pilot Natural Refrigerant Incentive Program, its first customer program providing incentives for GHG reduction in addition to kWh savings. SMUD is a founding member and active participant in the Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative, a public private partnership formed to better understand and plan for climate impacts expected in the region. SMUD is also an active member of the United States Department of Energy (the “DOE”) Partnership for Energy Sector Climate Resilience. SMUD regularly reviews scientific findings related to climate change and in 2016 published its Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan. In 2024, SMUD is planning to update the Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan along with other climate resiliency actions.

Energy Storage Systems. Assembly Bill 2514 (“AB 2514”) requires the Board to re-evaluate energy storage goals every three years. In compliance with AB 2514, the Board established a target of 9 MW of energy storage procurement by December 31, 2020, which SMUD has procured. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Energy Storage Systems” for further discussion of AB 2514. In September 2020, the Board directed that energy storage forecasts be implemented through SMUD’s IRP process going forward. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” above for a discussion of SMUD’s IRP. SMUD is also evaluating how to couple utility-scale solar with utility-scale storage to support future system reliability needs and enable energy goals.

Meeting Peak Load. A significant consideration for SMUD will be how it addresses its system peak load. SMUD has implemented programs and tools, such as advanced metering, energy efficiency options, and TOD rates for residential customers, to help customers manage their costs while helping SMUD reduce its peak load. Analysis of 2022 data showed a reduction of approximately 108 MW, weather continue to monitor the progress and results of the implementation of TOD rates and will use this information to inform future rate actions and load forecasts. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Time-of-Day Rates.”

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved an optional residential Critical Peak Pricing rate (the “Peak Pricing Rate”), which went into effect June 1, 2022. The Peak Pricing Rate is designed to reduce load by increasing the price of energy when the grid is most impacted, up to 50 hours per summer. In exchange, customers on the rate will receive a per kWh discount on summer Off-Peak and Mid-Peak rates. SMUD is also exploring the use of more distributed energy resources and demand response programs that could further reduce SMUD’s system peak.

Operational Independence and Local Control. A key component of SMUD’s business strategy is focused on maintaining its independence in operating and maintaining its resources. As such, SMUD has taken a number of actions to mitigate the potential impacts of various federal and state regulatory actions. For example, in 2002 SMUD established itself as an independent control area (now termed “Balancing Authority”) within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (“WECC”) region. By removing itself from CAISO’s Balancing Authority area, SMUD became responsible for balancing electric supply and demand within its own service territory. This move substantially reduced fees paid to CAISO, preserved operational flexibility and helped to insulate SMUD from the uncertain regulatory environment and tariff structure of CAISO. In addition to decreased financial risks, this independence also reduced SMUD’s exposure to the impacts of capacity and energy shortages in the CAISO Balancing Authority area. Further, as an independent Balancing Authority, SMUD continued to support the statewide electric grid in events of electrical emergencies requiring rotating outages, such as loss of major transmission lines or equipment, as provided in the statewide emergency plan. By 2006, the SMUD Balancing Authority footprint expanded north to the California-Oregon border and south to Modesto, to include the service areas of the WAPA, MID, Redding and Roseville, and TANC-owned 340-mile 500-kV California-Oregon Transmission Project.

# (“COTP”). 

In October 2009, SMUD, with the coordination and cooperation of WAPA, joined the Western Power Pool Reserve Sharing Group, which supports reliability and reduces operating costs. In May 2011, BANC assumed the role of the Balancing Authority, though SMUD continues to oversee operation of the grid on behalf of BANC. BANC members share cost responsibility for balancing authority-related compliance obligations, liabilities, and operations. BANC also serves as an important venue for SMUD and other BANC members to collaborate with respect to operational and market improvements inside the BANC footprint and to preserve their operational independence. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.” On April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its participation in BANC, began operating in the CAISO WEIM, which helps SMUD better manage the integration of renewable energy resources. The CAISO WEIM is a voluntary market, which allows SMUD to maintain its operational independence from the CAISO, while providing SMUD greater access to balancing resources throughout the western region. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

## Electricity, Natural Gas, and Related Hedging

SMUD continues to utilize a comprehensive and integrated power and fuel supply strategy to acquire a reliable and diversified portfolio of resources to meet existing and future needs. This strategy includes a combination of both physical supply and financial hedging transactions to reduce price risk exposure over a five-year horizon. SMUD’s physical supply arrangements include ownership of power generating resources, as well as a diversified portfolio of power and fuel supply purchase contracts that range in duration, with a mixture of fixed and variable pricing terms.

With regard to the power purchase contracts, SMUD has entered into a series of contracts for the purchase of electricity to meet its resource needs. SMUD also actively manages its exposure on variable rate electricity purchases, and at times may enter into financial contracts to fix prices by using options to reduce price risk, in each case when warranted by economic conditions. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements.”

With regard to fuel supply contracts, SMUD utilizes a similar strategy of employing financial contracts of various durations to hedge its variable fuel supply contracts. As of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply – Supply.”

As provided in SMUD’s natural gas contracts, SMUD may be required to post collateral to various counterparties. As of February 29, 2024, SMUD did not have any collateral posting obligations. A decrease in natural gas prices could result in a collateral posting by SMUD. While the posting of collateral is not an expense for SMUD, it does temporarily encumber unrestricted cash balances.

To hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a pass-through rate component called the Hydro Generation Adjustment (the “HGA”), and established a Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund (the “HRSF”). Similarly, to hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a HGA and established a WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund (“WRSF”). These rate stabilization funds and rate pass through mechanisms help to offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs in years where precipitation levels at SMUD-owned and non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities are low. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

![Managing Risks](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Managing+Risks)

**Managing Risks**  
SMUD maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program, a strategic approach to managing enterprise-wide risks as a portfolio, to help reduce the chance of loss, create greater financial stability and protect SMUD resources. It is designed to maintain an early warning system to monitor changes in, and the emergence of, risks that affect the organization’s business objectives. Under the purview of the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee, composed of executive members and chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, ERM conducts ongoing risk identification, assessments, monitoring, mitigation, risk-based budgeting and reporting. To ensure accountability and oversight, each identified risk is assigned to an executive-level risk owner. Risk status and mitigation efforts are reported monthly to the Board.

**Competitive Challenges**  
In the coming decade, utilities like SMUD may face competition from companies in other industries looking to diversify into the energy sector. Examples of developing competitive areas include retail sale of electricity, distributed electric storage resources, renewable distributed generation (mostly solar in Sacramento), customer installation of fuel cells, third-party electric vehicle charging, home or business automation that enables greater customer participation in energy markets, and third-party provision of energy management software and solutions.

SMUD has a wide range of initiatives to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions and new industry participants. Key areas of focus include:

- **Enhancing customer experience.** Recognizing the importance of meeting customer expectations, SMUD introduced the Customer Experience Strategy in 2016 to provide customers “value for what they pay” and further strengthen customer loyalty. The initiative is focused on ensuring SMUD has the people, systems, technology, programs and services to consistently meet or exceed customers’ changing expectations. The customer experience is measured via surveys with the goal of achieving 80% of customers agreeing that SMUD provides them with value for what they pay by 2030.

- **Restructuring electric rates.** In 2017, the Board approved TOD rates as the standard rate for residential customers. The residential rate transition began in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the full transition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. All of SMUD’s business customers are also on time-based rates. In 2019, the Board approved a restructuring of commercial rates to collect a greater portion of fixed costs through fixed charges and to better align time periods and prices with energy markets. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” and “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

- **Ongoing integrated resource planning.** SMUD monitors and updates its integrated resource planning to ensure future sources of energy balance cost, reliability and environmental requirements with the flexibility to meet challenges of changing market and regulatory conditions, customer energy resources, and emerging technologies.

**Leveraging Core Competencies**  
In addition to these initiatives, SMUD is leveraging core competencies to improve industry safety and help communities serve their customers’ energy needs.

![Sacramento Power Academy](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Sacramento Power Academy.** The Sacramento Power Academy is SMUD’s operational training center providing training support for all of SMUD’s skilled trades professionals. Operating on a 10-acre training facility the academy oversees SMUD’s 14 skilled trades apprenticeships. The academy’s experienced training professionals serve as liaisons and mentors to apprentices progressing through on-the-job training, program testing, night schooling, and extensive training components. The academy also ensures SMUD’s skilled trades professionals are safe and compliant by coordinating and delivering annual regulatory and safety training. The academy is also a workforce development hub utilized by SMUD to increase awareness of and interest in skilled trades careers at SMUD, in SMUD’s community, and in the utility industry.

**Community Energy Services.** In 2002, Assembly Bill 117 was passed to establish Community Choice Aggregation in the State by authorizing Community Choice Aggregators (“CCAs”) to aggregate customer electric load and purchase electricity for customers. SMUD’s Community Energy Services department was established in 2017 to support organizations with values closely aligned with SMUD’s values, while also generating additional revenue for SMUD. CCA programs are proliferating in the State thanks to support for expanding renewable energy use and desire for local control particularly for electricity procurement. There are numerous CCAs operating in the State, and more are anticipated to launch in the future. CCAs are responsible for procuring wholesale power, setting the generation rate, and staffing a call center to handle opt-outs and questions about the power portfolio. The local investor-owned utility (“IOU”) continues to deliver electricity from the electric grid, maintain its electric infrastructure, bill customers and collect payments.

In October 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Valley Clean Energy (“VCE”) to provide technical, energy and support services, including data management and call center services, while also providing energy and business operations support, to VCE for a term ending in 2023. SMUD and VCE recently executed a new contract for data management, contact center, consulting and debt collection services that expires on December 31, 2028. VCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the City of Woodland, the City of Davis and Yolo County to implement a local CCA program. The service territory expanded to include the City of Winters in 2021. The mission of VCE is to deliver cost-competitive clean electricity, product choice, price stability, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions to its customers in Yolo County. VCE began electric services to its customers in the summer of 2018, giving Yolo County residents a choice between two electricity providers, VCE and PG&E.

In November 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of East Bay Community Energy (“EBCE”) to provide call center and data management services for a three-year term beginning in January 2018. SMUD signed a new contract with EBCE in January 2022 for call center and data management services for an additional three-year term. EBCE recently changed its name to Ava Community Energy (“Ava”). Ava is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro and Union City in Alameda County to implement a local CCA program. Ava expanded its territory to the cities of Pleasanton, Newark, and Tracy in April 2021.

In June 2019, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Silicon Valley Clean Energy (“SVCE”) to provide program services to help local SVCE communities reduce carbon pollution while delivering engaging customer experiences. SVCE programs are focused on grid integration, as well as electrifying transportation, buildings and homes. This contract was extended through September of 2024. In June 2023, SMUD was selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s concierge service vendor for three years. In December 2023, SMUD was again selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s programs administrator for five years. SVCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Campbell, Cupertino, Gilroy, Lost Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill,

Mountain View, Saratoga, Sunnyvale and Unincorporated Santa Clara County to implement a local CCA program.

In July 2022, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Marin Clean Energy (“MCE”) to provide data management, billing, data analytic and system assessment services to MCE. MCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2010 and represents 37 member communities across four Bay Area counties: Contra Costa, Marin, Napa and Solano.

In September 2022, SMUD was selected through a competitive process by the governing board of Sonoma Clean Power (“SCP”) to provide market research services to SCP. In January of 2023, SMUD was selected to provide strategic consulting services, providing recommendations related to programs and marketing. SCP is a joint powers agency that serves Sonoma and Mendocino counties.

While CCAs have had success in the State, they are susceptible to business, regulatory and other risks that could lead to a financial loss and/or result in a cessation of operations for the CCA. These risks could extend to a CCA’s counterparties, including SMUD. SMUD has made an effort to identify and mitigate potential counterparty risks to the extent possible in service agreements with the CCAs described above. SMUD may pursue opportunities to provide similar services to additional CCAs in the future. SMUD management does not expect its current arrangements to have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

## FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION

### Precipitation Variability

SMUD uses a precipitation measuring station located at Fresh Pond, California to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s Upper American River Project (the “UARP”) hydropower reservoir. As of January 31, 2024, precipitation at Fresh Pond, California totaled 21 inches for the October-September hydropower water supply period. This is 75% of the 50-year rolling median of 28 inches. Total reservoir storage in the UARP hydropower reservoirs was 238 thousand acre-feet as of January 31, 2024, which was about 63% of capacity and approximately 6% above the historical average. SMUD manages its reservoirs to maximize water storage going into the summer season, which preserves generating capacity during SMUD’s high load months and ensures that SMUD meets its UARP FERC license requirements, including requirements for recreational and environmental flows.

There can be wide swings in precipitation from year to year. In years with below average rainfall, SMUD may have to generate or purchase replacement energy at additional cost. To hedge against variations in the volume of energy received from SMUD-owned UARP hydroelectric resources, SMUD uses the HRSF to help offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

SMUD is also exposed to precipitation variability through its contract with the WAPA. In an average water year this contract provides roughly 661 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of power. WAPA’s actual deliveries are based on hydroelectric generation (minus energy used for pumping) at Central Valley Project reservoirs in Northern California, which varies based on annual precipitation patterns, water deliveries for agriculture, and flow requirements in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Unlike the UARP, SMUD does not monitor precipitation stations to approximate power deliveries under the WAPA contract, and instead relies on a forecast of power deliveries from WAPA. As of January 31, 2024, WAPA has forecasted power deliveries of 703 GWh for 2024, approximately 6% more than an average water year. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration.”

![Wildfires](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Wildfires)

**Wildfires**

**General.** Wildfires in the State have become increasingly common and destructive. Frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased, and could further increase, the possibility of wildfires occurring in areas where SMUD maintains generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The number of diseased and dead trees has increased, and could further increase this possibility. As a result, SMUD faces an increased risk that it may be required to pay for wildfire related property damage or
<!-- Page 603 -->
![Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory)](https://example.com/image.png)

**Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory).** In 2018, the CPUC approved a new statewide fire map that identifies areas of elevated and extreme wildfire risk from utility-associated assets located throughout the State. SMUD directly participated in the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map. In connection with the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map, a peer review and a team of independent nationwide experts led by Cal Fire affirmed that SMUD’s electric service area is properly located outside of these elevated (“Tier 2”) and extreme (“Tier 3”) high fire threat areas; however, SMUD’s UARP facilities are located within both Tier 2 and Tier 3 areas. According to the CPUC, Tier 2 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an elevated wildfire risk from utility assets and Tier 3 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an extreme risk from utility assets. As of June 8, 2021, approximately 37 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 19 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. SMUD is also a member of TANC. As of July 2022, approximately 116.3 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 4.5 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. In accordance with its FERC license, SMUD adheres to a FERC-approved Fire Prevention and Response Plan for its UARP facilities. On May 17, 2018, in accordance with State law, SMUD’s Board of Directors determined that the UARP area may have a “significant risk of catastrophic wildfire” resulting from overhead electric facilities and that SMUD’s FERC-approved UARP Fire Prevention and Response Plan meets requirements for presenting wildfire mitigation measures to the Board for its approval.

**Wildfire Mitigation.** In response to potential wildfire risk, SMUD has implemented and is continuing to implement a series of measures intended to prevent wildfires from occurring, minimize the spread of any fire that does occur and improve the resiliency of its system. These measures include an increase in the number of inspections for fuel reduction inside and adjacent to rights-of-ways, utilization of Cal Fire-approved operational material to reduce the risk of spark generation; enhanced inspection and maintenance programs; increased use of ignition-reduction techniques, including undergrounding of conductors; increased monitoring of identified responses to fire conditions, including operational procedures for the de-energization of lines during high fire conditions; and elimination of automatic reclosing on SMUD’s transmission lines and on SMUD’s distribution lines in certain areas during fire season.

SMUD’s proactive approach to vegetation management has been expanded to include the use of advanced technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (“LiDAR”), ortho and oblique imagery that is used to pinpoint tree health and/or condition that may not yet be visible to the naked eye. In addition, SMUD has installed additional weather stations in transmission corridors and substations for increased situational awareness and has continued coordination and collaboration with local agencies and first responders as well as vulnerable populations.

State legislation enacted in 2018 and 2019 (SB 901 and AB 1054, respectively) requires publicly owned utilities (“POUs”) to prepare and present Wildfire Mitigation Plans to their governing boards by January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter. SB 901 requires POUs, including SMUD, before January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, to prepare a wildfire mitigation plan and present it in a public meeting to their governing board. SB 901 requires POU’s to accept comments on the wildfire mitigation plan from the public, other local and State agencies, and interested parties, and to verify that the plan complies with all applicable rules, regulations, and standards, as appropriate. The bill requires a qualified independent evaluator to review and assess the comprehensiveness of its wildfire mitigation plan and present its report to the board in a public meeting. AB 1054 created a new Wildfire Safety Division within the CPUC to prioritize wildfire safety throughout the State, and established an appointed Wildfire Safety Advisory Board (“WSAB”) to advise and make recommendations relating to wildfire safety to this new Division. For POUs, the bill requires submittal of annual wildfire mitigation plans to the WSAB for review and advisory opinions relating to the content and sufficiency of the plans.

A-18
<!-- Page 604 -->
SMUD assembled an enterprise-wide team of subject-matter experts to prepare its plan in compliance with this legislation. SMUD’s initial Wildfire Mitigation Plan (“WMP”) was adopted by the Board in the fourth quarter of 2019, after circulation for public comment and review of the comprehensiveness of the plan by a qualified independent evaluator. The WMP and evaluator’s report were submitted to the WSAB in 2020.

SMUD reviews its WMP each year, presenting the updated plan to the Board for adoption at duly noticed public meetings. The updated plans and evaluator reports are submitted to the WSAB for advisory opinion and recommendations. SMUD responds to the WSAB’s comments regarding SMUD’s WMP as part of its WMP process. SMUD will continue to annually review and update its WMP, conducting a comprehensive review at least every third year.

SMUD recently completed a comprehensive review and update of its WMP after soliciting public input and independent evaluation. The 2023-2025 WMP was adopted by the Board on June 15, 2023, and duly submitted to the WSAB.

### Wildfire Insurance
Wildfires both in California and nationally have not only increased potential liability for utilities, but have also adversely impacted the insurance markets, leading to higher costs for coverage; coverages becoming prohibitively expensive; limited or restricted coverage to certain types of risks; or coverage at insufficient levels. SMUD most recently renewed its general and wildfire liability insurance coverage on June 15, 2023, increasing the coverage limit by $25 million to $275 million. SMUD increased the commercially insured portion of its wildfire coverage program from $176 million to $212.5 million and maintained the self-insured layers and quota share portions of the coverage at $6.5 million.

In addition, it is expected that SMUD will have a portion of the $500 million aggregate limit of its commercial paper and line of credit program to provide operational flexibility in the event of the occurrence of a wildfire or other operational event. However, SMUD has not covenanted to maintain the availability of the commercial paper program and line of credit program for these purposes and no assurances can be given that the commercial paper and line of credit program will be available at the time of, or during, such an event.

### August 2020 Heat Wave
The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from August 14, 2020 through August 18, 2020. The CAISO was forced to institute rotating electricity outages in the State during this extreme heat wave. SMUD, as a member of BANC, and being outside of the CAISO did not have to implement any planned power disruptions. Additionally, SMUD was able to support the CAISO during some hours of the heat wave with both requested emergency assistance and wholesale market sales. SMUD’s peak demand between August 14, 2020 and August 18, 2020, varied between 2,874 MW and 3,057 MW, well below SMUD’s record peak of 3,299 MW.

### September 2022 Heat Wave
The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from September 5, 2022 through September 8, 2022. On September 6, 2022, SMUD experienced its second highest peak demand of 3,263 MW. SMUD did not have to implement any planned power disruptions.

### Storm Damage
In January 2023, SMUD experienced a series of winter storms that brought heavy rains and high winds causing damage to SMUD’s grid and widespread outages for SMUD’s customers. By the time the  
A-19

**storm response was complete, SMUD had experienced the largest mobilization of personnel and restoration crews in its history. SMUD incurred costs related to removing downed trees, restoring power from downed poles and broken lines, replenishing inventory, communicating with and providing assistance to customers, maintaining IT systems, and coordinating with local emergency agencies. SMUD is pursuing claims with Federal and State agencies to attempt to recover certain of SMUD’s costs related to the storms. The material financial impacts have been reflected in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, [which are included in APPENDIX B].**

**Cosumnes Power Plant Outage**

On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant (as defined herein) was shut down due to a ground fault in the Steam Turbine Generator (“STG”) stator. The ground fault was caused by delamination of the insulation on one of the through bolts. Damage from the ground fault resulted in a full rewind and restack of the stator core, replacement of all stator through bolts, and a full rewind of turbine rotor. The Cosumnes Power Plant repairs were completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. During the extended outage, SMUD shifted generation to the other local gas-fired plants and the Sutter Energy Center and procured additional energy and resource adequacy capacity. SMUD also requested and received approval from the California Air Quality Board and California Energy Commission to operate one or both of the gas turbines without the STG. During the September 2022 heatwave, both of the gas turbines at the Cosumnes Power Plant were operated without the STG, providing 270 MW at peak.

To mitigate the financial impact of unplanned outages from its thermal assets, SMUD carries commercial property insurance with a business interruption endorsement. At the time of the loss, the coverage provided up to $30.8 million of business interruption recovery per month at the Cosumnes Power Plant, with a sub-limit of $310 million over any 18-month period. During the period of loss, claims were subject to a $5 million equipment damage deductible and a 60-day business interruption claims waiting period.

SMUD has settled the equipment damage portion of the loss for $18.6 million, resulting in a $13.6 million recovery. The business interruption portion of the claim remains in process, with SMUD receiving a $50 million advance in December of 2022. As of January 2024, the carriers have confirmed an additional $51 million in undisputed recovery, which is anticipated to be received in the first quarter of 2024. Thus far, SMUD has recovered $114.6 million of the loss and will continue to work toward full settlement of the disputed portion of the claim, which is approximately $68 million.

**Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic**

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD has lessened since the height of the pandemic in 2020, SMUD is still experiencing impacts from the pandemic. However, compared to weather adjusted load levels, SMUD’s overall load is near or above pre-pandemic levels.

Part of the governmental response to the economic consequences of the pandemic required utility providers (including SMUD) to provide additional grace periods and flexible payment plans for the payment of utility bills or to refrain from pursuing collection remedies for unpaid bills for a period of time. SMUD also implemented a no-shutoff policy through January 2022 under which SMUD did not disconnect power to a customer for non-payment of their electric bill. Beginning in February 2022, SMUD resumed its normal payment, late fee, and disconnection process and began disconnections of unpaid accounts in late April 2022. As a result, SMUD has experienced an increase in delinquencies for customer electric accounts versus pre-pandemic levels. In December 2021, SMUD received $41 million from the California Arrearage Payment Program (“CAPP”) initial funding, and an additional $9.9 million in 2022. All funds were applied to delinquent balances. As of December 31, 2023, the total delinquencies for customer electric accounts were approximately $68 million.
<!-- Page 606 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

accounts were $38.2 million, after the CAPP credit, which is an increase from the February 2020 balance of total delinquencies for customer electric accounts of $16.9 million. The financial impacts stemming from delinquent accounts have been accounted for in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the preceding years. Any successful recovery of delinquent accounts will contribute to an increase in net income.

SMUD also paused the recertification process for existing customers in SMUD’s low-income discount program during the pandemic. The number of customers participating in the low-income assistance program increased by 16,407, or approximately 22% from February 2020 to December 2023. SMUD has resumed the recertification process for existing customers in the low-income discount program in 2023.

While the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD have lessened, if the pandemic and its consequences again become more severe or another similar event occurs, the impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations could be material.

## RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE

### Rates and Charges

SMUD’s Board of Directors has autonomous authority to establish the rates charged for all SMUD services. Unlike IOUs and some other municipal utility systems, retail rate and revenue levels are not subject to review or regulation by any other federal, State or local governmental agencies. Changes to SMUD rates only require formal action by the Board of Directors after two public workshops and a public hearing. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government. SMUD typically reviews and sets rates on a two-year cycle.

### 2019 Rate Action.

On June 24, 2019, the Board approved a 3.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2020, a 3.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2020, a 2.50% rate increase effective January 1, 2021, and a 2.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2021, for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved a restructuring of the commercial rates, including new time periods and an overall increase in the fixed bill components, such as the System Infrastructure Fixed Charge and demand charges, and a corresponding decrease in energy charges, making the restructuring revenue neutral by rate category. To minimize bill impacts, rate categories will be restructured over an eight-year period.

### 2021 Rate Action.

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved a 1.5% rate increase effective March 1, 2022 and a 2.0% rate increase effective January 1, 2023 for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved the Solar and Storage Rate, the optional residential Peak Pricing Rate, and updates to certain schedules of SMUD’s Open Access Transmission Tariff (“OATT”). The Board also approved a new timeline for the commercial rate restructure transition, and all impacted commercial customers were transitioned to the new rates by the end of the first quarter of 2022.

SMUD also implemented a solar interconnection fee based on the size of solar interconnection and supporting programs such as battery incentives, incentives to enroll in SMUD’s Peak Pricing Rate, battery incentives for Virtual Power Plants, and a program to bring the benefits of solar to under-resourced multi-family communities. These programs and fees are not subject to Board approval. 

A-21
<!-- Page 607 -->
![2023 Rate Action](https://example.com/image.png)

**2023 Rate Action**

On September 21, 2023, the Board approved a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2025, and a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2025 for all customer classes. The Board also approved establishing the Energy Assistance Program Rate (“EAPR”) Rate Stabilization Fund, which will provide an additional discount to those low-income customers with the greatest need. The discount will be funded with discretionary, non-retail rate revenue, as to not have an impact on any future required rate changes. There is currently pending litigation concerning the adoption of the 2023 rates. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”

**Rate Stabilization Funds**

The Rate Stabilization Fund (“RSF”) is maintained by SMUD to reduce the need for future rate increases when costs exceed existing rates. At the direction of the Board, amounts may be either transferred into the RSF (which reduces revenues) or transferred out of the RSF (which increases revenues). The Board authorizes RSF transfers on an event driven basis. The RSF includes funds to hedge variations in the volume of energy received from WAPA hydroelectric generation, variation in AB 32 revenue and variations in Low Carbon Fuel Credit (“LCFS”) revenue. As of December 31, 2023, the balance in the RSF was $115.8 million, which is approximately 7.2% of annual retail revenue.

Effective July 2008, SMUD implemented the HGA, which is a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from the UARP (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric”). The HGA is designed to increase the deposits to the HRSF in wet years when SMUD has more hydroelectric generation than expected. Each year SMUD determines the impact of precipitation variances on projected hydroelectric generation from the UARP. When the precipitation variance results in a deficiency of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, transfers from the HRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is zero. When the precipitation variance results in a projected surplus of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, deposits will be made into the HRSF in an amount approximating the positive impact to SMUD from the surplus hydroelectric generation (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is not sufficient to cover transfers that would otherwise be made in the event of a projected deficiency in UARP hydroelectric generation, a 12-month HGA surcharge will automatically be included on customers’ electric bills at a level that generates up to 4% of retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue on any precipitation variance calculation date and the precipitation variance results in a projected UARP hydroelectric generation surplus, the positive impact of the surplus may be used for other purposes at staff’s recommendation, with the approval of the Board, including returned to customers through an electric bill discount up to 4% of retail revenue. SMUD calculates HRSF transfers based on an April-March (water year) precipitation period at Fresh Pond, California. This precipitation station is used to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s UARP hydropower reservoirs. As of January 31, 2024, and based on the current HRSF water year precipitation forecast, SMUD anticipates transferring $20.8 million out of the HRSF in April 2024.

In September 2023, SMUD added a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from WAPA. Each year SMUD determines the WAPA Energy Delivery Variance (“EDV”) based on forecasted energy delivery minus the actual energy delivery. When the EDV variance is positive, transfers from the WRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 2% of cash).

**Low-Income Discount**

As of December 2023, approximately 91,407 customers received the low-income discount offered by SMUD, which represents approximately 16% of all residential customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, SMUD suspended recertification during the pandemic. In 2023, the total discount was approximately $32.7 million. As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn, SMUD experienced an increase in low-income discount applicants. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

While the low-income discount has provided substantial benefits to low-income customer bills for years, multiple economic variables, such as inflation and rate increases, have had disproportionately negative impacts on low-income customers, particularly those in the 0-50% Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”). In 2023, SMUD established an EAPR Rate Stabilization Fund (“ERSF”) to provide an additional discount to the electricity usage charge up to an established maximum discount (“ERSF Additional Discount”) for customers in the 0-50% FPL. The ERSF is funded by discretionary non-retail rate revenue, reviewed on an annual basis, and the specific monthly ERSF Additional Discount is set before the year the value is in effect. SMUD expanded its programs and services starting in 2016 to help customers with energy assistance, home improvement packages, and education. SMUD is creating tailored solutions to best meet the needs of low-income customers. These solutions include free solar panels and inspecting homes to identify energy saving and fuel switching opportunities.

# Customer Base; Largest Customers

A stabilizing influence on SMUD’s revenues is that a substantial proportion is derived from residential customers (49.2% in 2023). Historically, revenue from commercial and industrial consumption has been more sensitive to economic fluctuation. Furthermore, SMUD has no dominant customers that account for a significant percentage of annual revenues. In 2023, no single customer contributed more than 3% of revenues. The top ten customers generated approximately 9% of revenues and the top 30 generated approximately 15% of revenues.

# Power Generation Facilities

## Hydroelectric
The UARP consists of three relatively large storage reservoirs (Union Valley, Loon Lake and Ice House) with an aggregate water storage capacity of approximately 400,000 acre-feet and eight small reservoirs. Project facilities also include eight tunnels with a combined length of over 26 miles and eight powerhouses containing 11 turbines. In addition to providing clean hydroelectric power and operating flexibility for SMUD, the UARP area provides habitat for fish and wildlife and a variety of recreational opportunities, including camping, fishing, boating, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and cross-country skiing.

The combined capacity of the UARP is approximately 685 MW at SMUD’s load center in Sacramento. Under current licensing and mean water conditions, these facilities are expected to generate approximately 1,600 GWh of electric energy annually, which represents approximately 15% of SMUD’s current average annual retail energy requirements. In 1957, the Federal Power Commission (predecessor agency to FERC) issued a license to SMUD for the UARP. This 50-year license was subsequently amended to add and upgrade facilities and now includes all segments of SMUD’s hydroelectric facilities located on the South Fork of the American River and its tributaries upstream from the Chili Bar Project (described below). On July 23, 2014, FERC issued to SMUD a new 50-year license for the UARP.

On November 9, 2016 FERC issued an Order authorizing SMUD to construct the South Fork Powerhouse downstream of the UARP’s Slab Creek Dam. Construction was substantially completed in the fall of 2020, and the new powerhouse was placed into operation on October 25, 2022, adding 1.8 MW of generation to the UARP’s overall capacity.

On June 16, 2021, pursuant to Board authorization, SMUD approved the Chili Bar Hydroelectric Project which consists of a 7 MW powerhouse, reservoir, dam and spillway, north of Placerville on the South Fork of the American River for approximately $10.4 million (the “Chili Bar Project”). The Chili Bar Project is immediately downstream from the UARP and operates as the regulating reservoir for the UARP’s largest powerhouse. Owning the UARP and the Chili Bar Project enables SMUD to operate the two projects with a holistic approach to license compliance and generation efficiency.

## Solano 2 Wind Project
SMUD owns and operates an 87 MW wind project, located in Solano County, known as Solano 2. Solano 2 consists of 29 wind turbine generators (“WTGs”) rated at 3.0 MW. Energy from the project is collected at 21 kV and transmitted over a dedicated 3-mile overhead system to the SMUD-owned Russell substation. At the Russell facility, the energy is transformed to 230 kV and interconnected to PG&E’s Birds Landing Switching Station. Energy deliveries are scheduled through the CAISO.

## Solano 3 Project
In 2011 and 2012, SMUD constructed a 128 MW wind project adjacent to Solano Phase 2, known as Solano 3. The Solano 3 project consists of 31 WTGs rated at 1.8 MW and 24 WTGs rated at 3.0 MW. The project interconnects through a 34.5 kV underground collection system to the Russell substation. Like the Solano Phase 2 project, this energy is transformed to 230 kV and delivered through the CAISO.

## Solano 4 Project
SMUD has developed the Solano 4 Wind Project on land with a wind easement owned by SMUD near the Solano 3 project, known as the Collinsville and Roberts properties, to install 10 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW, and to remove the Solano 1 turbines and replace them with 9 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW. SMUD has met all of the CAISO requirements and has executed a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement (“GLIA”) as of June 2021 that will allow for 90.8 MW of capacity at the point of interconnection. In April 2021, SMUD submitted an application for advisory review by the Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (the “Solano ALUC”) of the Solano 4 Wind Project’s consistency.

with the 2015 Travis Air Force Base Land Use Compatibility Plan (the “Travis Plan”). In May 2021, the Solano ALUC purported to resolve that the Solano 4 Wind Project was inconsistent with the Travis Plan. In August 2021, the Board approved the Project Environmental Impact Report, made findings overriding the Solano ALUC’s finding of inconsistency, made findings there was no alternative to the project, and approved the Solano 4 Wind Project. In September 2021, Solano County filed a writ petition challenging SMUD’s approval of the Solano 4 Wind Project based on procedural environment, zoning and land use grounds. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 14, 2022, and the suit was dismissed on January 10, 2023. The settlement agreement allows for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project as planned.

In addition, SMUD applied for and obtained extensions of the Federal Aviation Administration Determinations of No Hazard allowing for construction of the turbines. A contract for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project was awarded to Vestas Corporation and the Solano 4 Wind Project is currently under construction. The expected operation date for the Solano 4 Wind Project is May 2024. PG&E identified upgrades needed to interconnect the Solano 4 Wind Project that will not be complete before the expected Solano 4 commercial operation date. PG&E has an approved project and expects to complete the needed upgrades by May of 2025. Realization of the full capacity of the Solano 4 Wind Project may be delayed into the second quarter of 2025 due to the timeframe established for the PG&E required transmission upgrades. SMUD has developed a mitigation plan for the limited interconnection capacity for the first year of operation, in coordination with CAISO and PG&E, of using all of the existing SMUD Solano Russell substation interconnection capacity combined for the dispatch of all the Solano Wind Project. SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process, which combines all phases of the Solano Wind Project so it may operate as one project. This was fully executed by SMUD, CAISO, and PG&E on February 27, 2023.

As of the end of 2023, all of the turbine site delivery roads and foundations for the Solano 4 Project have been completed, all of the turbine components have been delivered to the Solano 4 Project site and 10 of the Solano 4 Project turbines have been fully erected.

At the completion of the Solano 4 project, SMUD will have an installed wind capacity of 303 MW in connection with the overall Solano Wind Project, leaving 18 MW at the point of interconnection for future development.

**Distributed Solar Photovoltaic.** SMUD owns and operates approximately 2 MW of solar photovoltaic generating facilities. These facilities include installations at the Hedge Substation property, SMUD Headquarters, the East Campus Operations Center, and other smaller photovoltaic systems throughout the service area on parking lots.

**Hedge Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 4 MW, 8 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached commercial operation in January 2023.

**ESS Flow Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 0.45 MW, 3 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached test operation in September 2023, and commercial operation is planned for March 2024.

**Local Gas-Fired Plants.** SMUD constructed five local natural gas-fired plants in its service area: the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, the Campbell Soup Project, McClellan and the Cosumnes Power Plant (each defined below). These five plants are referred to collectively as the “Local Gas-Fired Plants.” These plants are a strategic component of SMUD’s resource mix. In addition to providing SMUD a total capacity of approximately 1,139 MW, the Local Gas-Fired Plants provide SMUD with needed

**Local Gas-Fired Plants Overview**

SMUD has entered into long-term agreements with SFA providing for the purchase by SMUD of all of the power from each of the Local Gas-Fired Plants on a take-or-pay basis. This consolidation created operational and administrative efficiencies without changing any of the functionality of the power plants. Although the Local Gas-Fired Plants are owned by SFA, SMUD has exclusive control of their dispatch and manages their operations as part of its overall power supply strategy.

Payments under the power purchase agreements are payable from the revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of the principal of or interest on SMUD’s Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the caption “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below), as are other maintenance and operation costs and energy payments. For further discussion of SMUD’s obligations to make these payments to SFA, see “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Joint Powers Authorities.”

**Description of the Five Local Gas-Fired Plants:**

1. **The Cosumnes Power Plant (the “Cosumnes Power Plant”)**  
   The Cosumnes Power Plant is a 612 MW natural gas-fired, combined cycle plant located in the southern portion of Sacramento County adjacent to SMUD’s decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant. Commercial operation of the Cosumnes Power Plant commenced on February 24, 2006. SFA increased the net generating capacity of the facility by 81 MWs via an Advanced Gas Path (“AGP”) upgrade. The additional AGP generation was realized after hardware and software upgrades were completed. The Cosumnes Power Plant is owned by SFA, a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and MID. The existing take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA expires no earlier than when the related bonds have been paid in full (the outstanding related bonds are scheduled to mature on July 1, 2030). On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant was shut down due to a ground fault in the STG stator. The repair was completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Cosumnes Power Plant Outage”.

2. **The Carson Cogeneration Project (the “Carson Project”)**  
   The Carson Project, a 103 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project consisting of separate cycle and peaking plants, provides steam to the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) wastewater treatment plant adjacent to the site. The Carson Project was originally owned by the Central Valley Financing Authority (“CVFA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and the SRCSD. Construction of the Carson Project was completed and the plant began commercial operation on October 11, 1995. The CVFA bonds issued to finance the Carson Project were defeased in September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Carson Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

3. **The Procter & Gamble Cogeneration Project (the “Procter & Gamble Project”)**  
   The Procter & Gamble Project, a 182 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, is located in an established industrial area of Sacramento. The initial combined cycle portion of the plant began commercial operation on March 1, 1997. Construction of the peaking plant portion of the Procter & Gamble Project commenced during 2000 and the unit achieved commercial status on April 24, 2001. The Procter & Gamble Project produces steam for use in Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company’s oleochemical manufacturing processes and electricity for sale to SMUD. The Procter & Gamble Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Cogeneration Authority (“SCA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA, a separate joint powers authority. The SCA bonds issued to finance the Procter & Gamble Project were defeased in
<!-- Page 617 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Procter & Gamble Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Procter & Gamble Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

The Campbell Soup Cogeneration Project (the “Campbell Soup Project”). The Campbell Soup Project, a 170 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project, was completed and began commercial operations on December 4, 1997. Upgrades were implemented during 2000, which increased the plant’s peaking capacity to 180 MW, well above its net demonstrated capacity of 159.8 MW. The plant is located in south Sacramento adjacent to the Capital Commerce Center (formerly the Campbell Soup Company food processing facility). The Campbell Soup Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Power Authority (“SPA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA. The SPA bonds issued to finance the Campbell Soup Project were redeemed in July 2015. In late 2021, ownership of the Campbell Soup Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Campbell Soup Project (the “Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA”) covers both the Campbell Soup Project and McClellan and will be in effect until terminated by SMUD. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing the Campbell Soup Project in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

The McClellan Gas Turbine (“McClellan”). McClellan is a 72 MW natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine generating plant at McClellan Business Park in Sacramento. This turbine is connected to SMUD’s electric system and is operated to meet SMUD’s peak-load requirements. McClellan is aligned for remote starting and operation with both black start and fast start capabilities. SMUD constructed the McClellan unit in 1986 as a 50 MW emergency power source for the McClellan Air Force Base. In 2001, following the closure of the Air Force base, McClellan was repurposed for SMUD’s use. In May 2007, SMUD transferred ownership of McClellan to SPA for more efficient operation. SPA did not issue debt related to McClellan. In late 2021, ownership of McClellan was transferred to SFA. SFA pays all costs of operations and maintenance through to SMUD in accordance with the terms of the Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA. In exchange for paying all costs related to McClellan, SMUD receives all of the power generated thereby on a take-or-pay basis. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing McClellan in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

Fuel Supply

General. SMUD is obligated to arrange for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Management of the natural gas procurement and delivery process is a key focus of SMUD’s reliability and risk policies. Although the natural gas consumption of the power plants for SMUD’s load can vary significantly depending on the season, precipitation, and the market price of power and natural gas, the plants are forecasted to need, on average in 2024, a total of approximately 91,000 Decatherms per day (“Dth/day”) with a daily peak slightly more than 171,000 Dth/day of natural gas. SMUD has implemented a comprehensive strategy to secure a reliable and diversified fuel supply through a variety of agreements for the supply, transportation, and storage of natural gas.

Supply. SMUD hedges a significant portion of its expected gas needs to meet customer power requirements. This includes gas for the Local Gas-Fired Plants and for the Sutter Energy Center. See “Power Purchase Agreements – Sutter Energy Center”. This is accomplished through a combination of long-term supply arrangements and an exposure reduction program. The program consists of a primarily rolling three-year exposure reduction component, a fuel hedging component on a rolling three-year basis, as well as supplemental fixed calendar year components reaching out up to five calendar years. Long-term

A-32
<!-- Page 618 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

arrangements may consist of a combination of physical commodity supply contracts, financial hedges, or options. Natural gas is purchased from a wide variety of producers and marketers at the northern and southern California borders, and from the San Juan and the Rocky Mountain supply basins. SMUD has a number of both fixed-price supply agreements and financial hedging contracts to fix gas costs ranging from one month to several years in duration. Including fixed price biogas contracts as of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted.

SMUD has contracted with NCGA to purchase an approximate average of 8,700 Dth/day over the remaining life of a contract expiring May 31, 2027 (the “NCGA Contract”). Under the NCGA contract, SMUD pays a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. Until November 1, 2023 the delivery point for the NCGA Contract was the AECO hub in Alberta. Starting November 1, 2023, to increase delivery efficiencies, SMUD has exchanged the gas delivered at the AECO hub under the NCGA Contract with gas delivered at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border. From there SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants.

SMUD has also contracted with NCEA to purchase an approximately 22,000 Dth/day on average, or to be converted to the appropriate cash flow value in Megawatt-hours (“MWh”) of electricity over the remaining life of a contract expiring on May 31, 2049. The gas will be delivered to the SMUD system via the Malin receipt point on the PG&E backbone system. SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants. SMUD will pay a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. In connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement), SMUD expects to amend and restate the contract with NCEA in connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement.) [adjust for 2024 Senior Bonds offering documents]

**Renewable Natural Gas Supply.** As a component of meeting SMUD’s RPS goals, SMUD procures renewable natural gas and digesters gas as fuels to generate renewable electricity from the Cosumnes Power Plant. Descriptions of the renewable natural gas supply agreements are provided below.

In March 2009, SMUD entered into a 15-year contract (that qualifies as renewable energy) with Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (“Shell Energy”) to purchase up to 6,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from a landfill project in Texas. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in April 2009. In March 2012, SMUD amended the contract with Shell Energy to increase the maximum volumes to 7,300 Dth/day and extended the term by 10 years to March 31, 2034. Currently, the delivery point is PG&E Topock and SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In 2016, SMUD entered into a 3-year contract with Shell Energy to sell back the entire volume of renewable natural gas purchased, less 500 Dth/day, to be sold into the vehicle transportation markets. Upon expiration of the initial 3-year contract for the sale of biogas to Shell Energy, SMUD extended the sell back of the entire volume of biogas twice for an additional three years with Element Markets (now RNG, LLC), starting in 2020 and 2023. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

SMUD contracted with Heartland Renewable Energy, LLC (“HRE”) in December 2009 for a 20-year supply of up to 7,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas from a digester facility in Colorado. Deliveries began in March of 2014. Currently, the delivery point is Opal, Wyoming and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. HRE has not delivered volumes from the project to SMUD since December 2016 due to litigation with Weld County, Colorado regarding odor and
<!-- Page 619 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

permit issues. EDF Renewables, the majority owner of HRE, notified SMUD in August of 2017 that it is in discussions with a short list of bidders to sell its interests in the facility. In June of 2020, the project was purchased and SMUD’s contract was assigned to the new owner, Platte River Biogas, LLC (“PRB”). SMUD and PRB reached a settlement in the third quarter of 2021 that could lead to terminating the contract.

In September 2011, SMUD and CVFA entered into a “Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement” through which the Carson Project cleans nearly all of the digester gas received from Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) and sells it to SMUD for delivery to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In return, SMUD pays all of the Carson Project’s costs in acquiring, cleaning and making the gas available to SMUD. The Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement expires in September 2025. In late 2021, the Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, along with the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The Carson Project is currently receiving, processing and selling up to 1,500 Dth/day with provisions for volume increases over time to 2,500 Dth/day. Digester gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations.

In December 2011, SMUD entered into a 20-year agreement with EIF KC Landfill Gas LLC (“EIF”) to purchase up to 7,050 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from multiple landfill projects. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in January 2014. Currently the delivery point is Kern River – Opal and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. Renewable natural gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations. In April 2022, SMUD entered into a transaction to sell the renewable natural gas purchased into the renewable natural gas markets. The transaction expires in March 2025. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

AB 2196 is a law that defines the criteria by which existing and future renewable natural gas contracts will qualify for the State RPS program. The CEC adopted a RPS Eligibility Guidebook on April 30, 2013, which includes detailed rules for implementation of AB 2196. SMUD received an updated certificate of eligibility from the CEC in July 2014 for the Cosumnes Power Plant that included the quantities of renewable natural gas from all contracts. The CEC adopted a revised RPS Eligibility Guidebook (Ninth Edition) on April 27, 2017. This latest guidebook did not change the RPS eligibility of any of the above SMUD renewable natural gas and digester gas contracts, but did simplify reporting requirements for these contracts.

Gas Transmission

SMUD has satisfied its obligation to deliver natural gas to its power plants by constructing a natural gas pipeline, purchasing an equity interest in two PG&E backbone gas transmission lines, and contracting for capacity on a number of existing interstate natural gas transmission lines.

The Local Pipeline. SMUD constructed and owns a 20-inch, 50-mile natural gas pipeline in the greater Sacramento area (the “Local Pipeline”) that transports gas to all of the Local Gas-Fired Plants except McClellan. The Local Pipeline is interconnected with PG&E’s major State gas transmission lines 300 and 401. Additionally, it may be interconnected with one or more private gas gathering pipelines located in the area, a gas storage project and/or other FERC approved pipelines that may be built in the local area. In conjunction with the construction of the Cosumnes Power Plant, SMUD extended the Local Pipeline to the plant site. The 26-mile extension was completed in 2004. The extension is 24 inches in diameter and was designed to serve both the Cosumnes Power Plant and an additional second phase, if constructed.

![PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401](https://example.com/image.png)

**PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401.** In 1996, SMUD purchased an equity interest in PG&E’s backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 (referred to as the PG&E backbone). The total capacity acquired at that time was approximately 85,000 Dth/day and consisted of approximately 43,600 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, Oregon and 44,700 Dth/day from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California. SMUD was also entitled to a share of non-firm capacity, which was approximately 4,360 Dth/day; making the total capacity potentially available to SMUD almost 90,000 Dth/day. This purchase made SMUD a co-owner of the PG&E backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 and obligated SMUD to pay PG&E to operate the pipelines on its behalf subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and operating protocols. PG&E reduced operating pressures on Line 300 after PG&E suffered a natural gas explosion in San Bruno, CA in September of 2010. Operating pressures and capacity may also fluctuate due to regulatory and other changes. As of December 1, 2021, SMUD holds a total capacity of approximately 87,000 Dth/day, consisting of approximately 47,572 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, and 39,193 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California.

**Kern River Gas Transmission Company Long Term Agreement.** Kern River Gas Transmission Company for 200,000 Dth/day of firm capacity through April 30, 2028. This capacity gives SMUD access to the Rocky Mountain supply basin at Opal, Wyoming, and connects to PG&E Line 300 (owned in part by SMUD) at Daggett, California.

SMUD’s diversified portfolio of gas transmission arrangements allows for the purchase of gas from a variety of suppliers and locations, and the opportunity to capitalize on regional price differentials where possible. In addition, it ensures diversity in the SMUD/PG&E backbone and enhances the reliability of SMUD’s gas supply.

**Gas Storage**

SMUD also employs gas storage as part of its overall fuel supply strategy. Gas storage is useful in helping to balance gas supply, mitigate market price volatility, and provide a reliable supply to meet peak day delivery requirements.

SMUD has a contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2023 and expires in March 2026, for capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity.

SMUD also has a second contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2022 and expires in March 2024, for additional capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity. SMUD does not plan to renew this contract upon expiration.

SMUD has a contract with Wild Goose Storage LLC, that will begin in April 2024 (but which allows for early injection (December 2023 – March 2024)) for capacity in the Wild Goose Storage project located near Gridley in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 0.2 million Dth of storage inventory, ratcheted (12,500-14,000 Dth/day) volumes of injection rights and ratcheted (10,000 – 24,000 Dth/day) volumes of withdrawal capacity.

# Power Purchase Agreements

SMUD has a number of power purchase agreements to help meet its power requirements. Some of these agreements are described below.

## Western Area Power Administration
Effective January 1, 2005, SMUD entered into a 20-year contract with WAPA. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement extending the term by 30 years for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2054. Power sold under this contract is generated by the Central Valley Project (“CVP”), a series of federal hydroelectric facilities in northern California operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The contract provides WAPA’s CVP Base Resource customers (including SMUD) delivery of a percentage share of project generation in return for reimbursement of an equivalent share of project costs. SMUD’s CVP Base Resource share is roughly 25% of project generation and costs. This is expected to be approximately 318 MW of capacity and 661 GWh of energy in an average water year but will vary depending on precipitation. Energy available under the contract is determined by water releases required for water supply and flood control and is then shaped into higher value periods within other CVP operating constraints. More capacity and energy are typically available in spring and summer months and less in fall and winter.

SMUD also has a contract with WAPA expiring December 31, 2024, by which WAPA delivers an additional 200-300 MW per hour from projects located in the Pacific Northwest based on certain contractual parameters. In 2022, SMUD received 1,913 GWh of energy under this contract. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement for the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2030.

## Avangrid (formerly Iberdrola Renewables (“Iberdrola”))
SMUD has a contract with Iberdrola for 126 GWh of wind power generated in Solano County, California. The SMUD Board approved an extension of the wind contract through June 30, 2025.

## Patua Project LLC
In April 2010, SMUD entered into a power purchase agreement with Patua Project LLC (“Patua”), a subsidiary of Gradient Resources, for the delivery of up to 132 MW (expected to be 120 MW nominal power output) of renewable energy from geothermal generation being developed in north central Nevada, from a Gradient Resources project known as the Patua Project. The Patua Project was to have been developed in three phases. Since 2010, the agreed upon capacity has been reduced several times. In December 2013, Phase 1 of the project, which had been reduced to 30 MW, finally achieved commercial operation. In 2014, the parties concluded negotiations on the fourth amendment to the power purchase agreement with Patua, which reduced the total capacity down to 40 MW, extended the commercial operation date of Phase 2 to January 1, 2016, and allowed Patua to add up to 13 MW of solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production. In addition, this amendment shifted responsibility to Patua for a portion of the long-term transmission service agreements that have been underutilized due to the project not meeting its targets. In November 2015, the Patua Project was acquired by TL Power, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cyrq Energy, Inc. (“Cyrq”). In December 2015, Cyrq terminated Phase 2. Upon termination of Phase 2, the contractual right for Cyrq to add solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production was reduced to 10 MW. As a result of poor performance during the first year of operation, SMUD reduced its obligation to take power from 30 MW to 25 MW. Performance continued to lag in 2015 and 2016 and SMUD further reduced its obligation to take power from 25 MW to 19 MW.

## Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff
In September 2009, SMUD’s Board authorized a feed-in tariff program for the purchase of renewable energy from local renewable energy projects connected to SMUD’s distribution system. SMUD’s Board authorized connection of up to 100 MW under the feed-in tariff which included standard payment rates and standard purchase terms for power. The feed-in tariff program became effective on January 1, 2010. Under the feed-in tariff, SMUD has executed 20-year term power purchase

A-36

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

agreements for solar projects totaling 98.5 MW. Construction and start-up were completed on all projects between 2010 and 2012.

**CalEnergy LLC.** In August 2014, SMUD entered into a 22-year power purchase agreement with CalEnergy LLC for the purchase of 30 MW per year of renewable energy from its Salton Sea geothermal facilities. As of July 1, 2017, SMUD began receiving up to 10 MW from the CalEnergy portfolio, which escalated to the full 30 MWs on May 1, 2020.

**Rancho Seco Solar.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Rancho Seco Solar LLC for the purchase of energy from a 10.88 MW solar PV project sited on SMUD’s property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Commercial operation was achieved in August of 2016. Rancho Seco Solar LLC leased the property from SMUD under a land lease agreement. The output of this project directly serves two large commercial customers that executed agreements with SMUD for retail supply of solar power.

In May 2019, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement for an additional 160 MW solar PV project with Rancho Seco Solar II, LLC. The project is located on SMUD-owned property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, adjacent to the existing 10.88 MW solar PV project. Construction began in 2019, and the project became commercially operable in February 2021.

**Grady Wind Energy.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Grady Wind Energy LLC (“Grady”) for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW wind project located in New Mexico (the “Grady Project”). The Grady Project began commercial operations on August 5, 2019. Energy from the Grady Project is delivered to CAISO. SMUD purchases 100% of the Grady Project output, which includes energy, renewable energy credits, and capacity attributes.

**Great Valley Solar 2, LLC.** In January 2017, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Great Valley Solar 2, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 60 MW solar PV project located in Fresno County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was December 28, 2017.

**ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC.** On September 14, 2016, Senate Bill 859 (“SB 859”) was signed into law. Under SB 859, a POU must procure its proportionate share of 125 MW of renewable energy from biomass plants burning high hazard forest fuels, subject to terms of at least five years. Seven POUs (SMUD, MID, Turlock Irrigation District (“TID”), Anaheim Public Utilities, Imperial Irrigation District, Los Angeles Department of Water & Power and Riverside Public Utilities, collectively described herein as the “ARP-Loyalton POUs”) jointly solicited proposals for up to 29 MW of contract capacity for renewable energy to meet the requirements of SB 859. In January 2018, SMUD entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC to fulfill 18 MW of the required 29 MW with SMUD’s share being just over 23 percent (the “ARP-Loyalton PPA”). See “—Roseburg Forest Products Co.” below for a discussion of the remaining SB 859 capacity. The contract became effective on April 1, 2018. On February 18, 2020, ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and stopped producing and selling energy from the biomass plant. On May 7, 2022, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the Loyalton facility to Sierra Valley Enterprises, LLC (“SVE”). SVE initially expressed interest in bringing the facility back into service; however, the bankruptcy trustee requested requested extension of the deadline for SVE to accept or reject the ARP-Loyalton PPA. The latest deadline was April 19, 2023, the date of expiration of the ARP-Loyalton PPA terms. SVE did not resume operations before the end of the ARP-Loyalton PPA term, the ARP-Loyalton POUs have negotiated a settlement agreement with the bankruptcy trustee (the “ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement”). The ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement, which SMUD executed and is filed with the court, defines funds from the performance security that the ARPLoyalton POUs will keep to cover legal and administrative fees, along with a contingency amount to cover potential risk of future damages. Since the ARP-Loyalton POUs entered into a five-year agreement to

A-37
<!-- Page 623 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

procure compliant biomass and provided SVE the opportunity to accept the ARP-Loyalton PPA and restart operations, the ARP-Loyal POU consider their statutory obligations to have been fulfilled.

**Roseburg Forest Products Co.** For the remaining SB 859 biomass obligation of 11 MW, SMUD and the other ARP-Loyalton POUs have entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with Roseburg Forest Products Co. SMUD’s share of the contract capacity is 2.5795 MW, and the plant began operating under the contract on February 26, 2021.

**Sutter Energy Center.** SMUD entered into an initial two-year contract (with a third-year exercisable option) with Calpine Energy Services, L.P. (“Calpine”) for the ability to schedule up to 258 MW of energy from Sutter Energy Center. The Sutter Energy Center is a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle facility located in Yuba City, California. The initial contract became effective on April 1, 2018. SMUD exercised its option to extend the contract, which expired November 1, 2020. SMUD entered into a new contract with Calpine for the same 258 MW of energy that became effective January 1, 2021, and had an original expiration date of January 1, 2024. In December 2021, SMUD extended this contract through December 31, 2026.

**Drew Solar, LLC.** In June 2018, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Drew Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 100 MW solar PV project located in Imperial County, California. The project’s scheduled commercial operation date was set to be December 31, 2021. The commercial operation date was delayed due to Force Majeure claims surrounding the COVID pandemic and supply chain constraints caused by changes in Federal regulatory requirements. The project began commercially operating on November 3, 2022.

**Wildflower Solar I, LLC.** In October 2018, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Wildflower Solar I, LLC, for the purchase of energy, capacity, and RECs from a 13 MW solar PV project located in Rio Linda, California. The project began commercially operating on December 18, 2020.

**Coyote Creek (Formerly Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC.)** In August 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW solar PV and 100 MW four-hour Battery Energy Storage System (“BESS”) capacity project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but has been delayed to 2026 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

**SloughHouse Solar, LLC.** In September 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with SloughHouse Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 50 MW solar PV project located in Sacramento County, California.

# Transmission Service Agreements

## TANC California-Oregon Transmission Project
The 340-mile COTP is one part of a three 500-kV line coordinated system known as the California-Oregon Intertie (“COI”). The COTP is allocated one-third of the 4,800 MW capability of the COI system (see related agreements below). TANC is entitled to 1,390 MW and is obligated to pay approximately 80% of the operating costs of the COTP. SMUD is a member of TANC and a party to Project Agreement No. 3 (“PA3”), under which it is entitled to 378 MW and obligated to pay on an unconditional take-or-pay basis about 27.5% of TANC’s COTP debt service and operations costs, subject to a “step-up” obligation of up to 25% of its entitlement share upon the unremedied default of another TANC member-participant. In 2009, SMUD entered into a long-term layoff agreement with certain members that increased SMUD’s entitlement by 35 MW. In 2014, SMUD entered into another long-term layoff agreement with certain other members that increased SMUD’s COTP entitlements by 128 MW and amended the 2009 layoff agreement that returned 13 MW to a member. In January 2024, SMUD entered into an agreement to extend the 2009 long-term layoff agreement with certain members to January 31, 2034. As of January 31, 2024, SMUD was entitled to approximately 528 MW of TANC’s transfer capability for imports and 405 MW for exports, and is obligated to pay approximately 38.6% of TANC’s COTP debt service and operations costs. SMUD’s payments under this contract, like SMUD’s payments under its other power purchase and transmission service agreements, are treated as “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under resolutions securing the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the section “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below). SMUD relies on its COTP rights to purchase power, access contingency reserves through the Western Power Pool, and obtain renewable resources to supplement its own resources to serve its load. TANC maintains a contingency reserve and a property/casualty insurance program. TANC’s budget for COTP costs, support services and advocacy expenses is about $45.4 million for 2023. SMUD’s obligation on the TANC budget is about $17.5 million for 2023.

## TANC Tesla-Midway Transmission Service
TANC has a long-term contract with PG&E to provide TANC with 300 MW of transmission service between PG&E’s Midway Substation and the electric systems of the TANC Members (the “Tesla-Midway Service”). SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service had been 46 MW. As part of the 2009 long-term layoff agreement, SMUD acquired an additional 2 MW of South-of-Tesla Principles (“SOTP”) transmission rights for 15 years starting February, 2009 from another TANC member, bringing SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service to 48 MW.

## Bonneville Power Administration
In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration (“BPA”) for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service from BPA’s Hilltop substation in northeastern California to the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua geothermal project over BPA’s 230kV transmission lines. In early 2013, in accordance with BPA’s transmission tariff, the transmission service was split into two 30 MW services and deferred as appropriate to better fit the timing of expected commercial operation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Patua Project LLC.” SMUD submitted another request for the 30 MW of transmission procured for Phase 2 of the Patua Project to split the service into a 10 MW and a 20 MW service, with the 10 MW service deferred and timed with the originally expected commercial operation date of Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 1 of the Patua Project and SMUD’s reduced obligation due to the poor performance of Phase 1 of the Patua Project, much of the transmission reserved for it will no longer be needed. BPA does not have a provision in its transmission tariff for early termination of transmission service. However, the power purchase agreement with Patua requires Patua to cover unused transmission that SMUD has procured for the Patua purchases. On January 1, 2020, SMUD’s transmission rights with BPA were reduced to 19 MW. This now aligns with SMUD’s PacifiCorp transmission rights of 19 MW described in the immediately following paragraph.

**PacifiCorp.** In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with PacifiCorp for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service across PacifiCorp’s high voltage step-up transformer at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In early 2013, in accordance with PacifiCorp’s transmission tariff, the commencement of the 60 MW of transmission service was deferred to fit the timing of first deliveries expected from the 30 MW of Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In 2013, SMUD terminated the 60 MW of transmission service and requested two new transmission services of 30 MW each, with service start dates timed to better fit with the expected start dates of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the reduction in expected output of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the second 30 MW transmission agreement, and replaced it with a 10 MW transmission service agreement for Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 2 of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the 10 MW PacifiCorp transmission service agreement and as a result of the reduced obligation to take power from the Patua Project, SMUD has reduced its remaining PacifiCorp transmission service from 30 MW to 19 MW.

**Western Area Power Administration.** SMUD does not have a direct interconnection of its power system to the COTP. To receive power deliveries that use its COTP rights, SMUD has a long-term transmission service agreement with WAPA for transmission of 342 MW of power from the COTP line (received at WAPA’s Tracy or Olinda substations) to SMUD’s system. In May of 2011, WAPA completed the Sacramento Voltage Support Transmission Project. Completion of this project has given SMUD an additional 165 MW of transmission service rights on WAPA’s system from the COTP at the Olinda Substation to SMUD’s system at the Elverta Substation.

**Projected Resources**

The following tables titled “Projected Requirements and Resources to Meet Load Requirements Energy Requirements and Resources” (the “Energy Table”) and “Capacity Requirements and Resources Net Capacity – Megawatts” (the “Capacity Table”) describe SMUD’s contracted commitments and owned resources available to meet its forecasted load requirements through the year 2033. Resources are shown on an annualized basis with market purchases net against surplus sales to arrive at a single net position for each year. Because SMUD’s available resources do not exactly match its actual load requirements on an hourly basis, there are times during a year when resources available will either exceed or be insufficient to meet SMUD’s needs. Expected actual capacity values are included in the tables. These values may differ from measured net demonstrated capacity values of the Local Area Gas-Fired Plants. The table below also includes the impact energy efficiency has on resources requirements as discussed below under “Demand Side Management Programs.” See “BUSINESS STRATEGY” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.”

Resources listed in both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table are listed as either renewable or non-renewable. Generally, SMUD follows the CEC guidelines for eligibility requirements. Some of SMUD’s renewable resources listed include solar, wind, geothermal, small hydroelectric facilities with a capacity of 30 MW or less, and biomass (representing generation from a fuel comprised of agricultural wastes and residues, landscape and tree trimmings, wood and wood waste).

As in any forecast, assumptions are made. In both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table the WAPA and UARP forecasts assume average water conditions throughout the period. On the capacity table, WAPA and Cosumnes Power Plant renewable capacity is estimated based on the ratio of renewable energy to total WAPA or Cosumnes Power Plant energy. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric.”

A-40
<!-- Page 626 -->
The Uncommitted Purchases (Sales) on the tables represent either anticipated future needs or surpluses. Future needs are met well in advance of delivery. They also include both renewable and non-renewable resources.

The Transmission Losses represent reductions in the amount of energy or capacity from the location it was purchased to the point of entering SMUD’s electrical system. This amount reduces the Total Resources available to meet the Total Projected Energy Requirements of the electrical system.

## Demand Side Management Programs

SMUD’s demand-side management initiatives represent an integral element of its total resource portfolio, and are organized into two major components: energy efficiency and load management programs. Energy efficiency offerings include a wide variety of programs and services to customers to retrofit or upgrade existing equipment and fixtures and to install new energy efficiency measures in existing and new construction facilities. Load management allows SMUD to reduce the load on the electric system by cycling residential air conditioning, and calling upon commercial/industrial customers to curtail energy usage when energy is constrained during the summer or system emergencies. Load management programs are projected to allow SMUD to shed approximately 60 MW of peak load in an emergency on a hot day, representing about 2% of SMUD’s maximum system peak demand.

The customer “smart meter” system with 2-way communication capability provides information regarding customer usage patterns, which is expected to help SMUD tailor rate designs that provide customers with both the information and ability to manage their energy usage around high energy cost periods.

# Balancing Authority Area Agreements

## Background
SMUD began operating as an independent control area, later termed a Balancing Authority, on June 18, 2002 within the WECC reliability organization’s region. This reduced SMUD’s exposure to the costs and reliability risks of the CAISO’s markets. SMUD expanded its operational footprint beyond SMUD’s service territory to include WAPA’s electric system, including the MID, Roseville, and Redding service areas (on January 1, 2005) and the COTP (on December 1, 2005). As described further below, SMUD ceased to be the Balancing Authority on April 30, 2011, as BANC took SMUD’s place as the Balancing Authority. SMUD remains the operator of the Balancing Authority through a contract with BANC. SMUD administers the contracts with WAPA and TANC to provide specified Balancing Authority-related and other services, and is compensated by WAPA and TANC. TANC recovers such Balancing Authority services costs as a part of its annual operating budget from the COTP Participants and WAPA recovers its Balancing Authority services costs through its rates for power and transmission service. The agreement with WAPA, among other terms, establishes operating procedures and reserve obligations between the parties and terminates on December 31, 2024. BANC, SMUD and WAPA will develop successor agreements in 2024 to take effect upon expiration of the existing contract. WAPA in turn has agreements with electric systems connected to it to assure that such systems also operate reliably (i.e., MID, Roseville and Redding). As a result of the transition to BANC as the Balancing Authority, SMUD assigned or terminated its interconnection and operations agreements with other connecting Balancing Authority areas (i.e., CAISO, BPA and TID). BANC is now the party to these agreements as they primarily address only Balancing Authority matters required for compliance with the reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”), such as emergency assistance arrangements. See also “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY” – Western Energy Imbalance Market.”

## Reliability Standards
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC authority to enforce reliability standards for the bulk electric system. In June 2007, these standards became mandatory for SMUD and BANC.

In 2022, SMUD and BANC underwent a combined NERC/WECC audit to evaluate compliance with applicable reliability standards. These audits occur every three years. At the conclusion of the audit, regulators determined that neither entity had any compliance violations related to the Operations and Planning or Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards. SMUD and BANC will undergo another NERC/WECC audit sometime in 2025.

## Balancing Authority of Northern California
SMUD, MID, Redding and Roseville executed a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (the “BANC JPA Agreement”) creating BANC on May 8, 2009. BANC became operational on May 1, 2011 as a Balancing Authority and replaced SMUD as the entity responsible for Balancing Authority-related reliability standards. Since that time, the Trinity Public Utilities District and the City of Shasta Lake have also become members of BANC. As provided in the BANC member agreement, liability for penalties associated with such Balancing Authority-related reliability standards are shared on a pro rata basis among the members of BANC. SMUD is the Balancing Authority operator under contract and performs Balancing Authority operational functions on behalf of BANC, much as it did when it was the Balancing Authority. The BANC JPA Agreement assigns cost responsibility based on member load within the BANC Balancing Authority, with SMUD representing approximately 70% of the total load.

## Power Pool and Other Agreements

### Western Power Pool Agreement
The Western Power Pool (“WPP”) is an agreement among over 30 utilities and public agencies in the western United States to coordinate contingency reserve sharing.
<!-- Page 630 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

referred to as the WPP Reserve Sharing Program (“RSP”). The RSP permits participants to rely on one another in the event that any participant experiences a generating resource outage. While SMUD became an RSP participant in 2009, participation is limited to Balancing Authorities, which SMUD relinquished to BANC in 2011. Under the RSP, BANC and TID (also a WPP member) share their reserve amounts and when necessary and when sufficient unused COTP rights and capacity are available, may call upon WPP reserves from the RSP member systems in the Pacific Northwest. The WPP RSP permits members to operate more efficiently by reducing the contingency reserves that they would otherwise need to have available if they could not rely on each other.

**TANC-SMUD OASIS Administration Agreement.** SMUD entered into an agreement with TANC to provide OASIS services (transmission sales and scheduling related services in the BANC BA of TANC members’ COTP rights) on September 29, 2005. SMUD is compensated for performing these services. TANC and SMUD entered into a letter agreement dated October 25, 2010 to clarify each party’s role for regulatory reliability standards compliance responsibilities and take into account SMUD’s increased efforts related to supporting TANC’s compliance requirements. SMUD and TANC entered into an agreement to transition this service to the Western Area Power Administration, effective on May 1, 2023. Going forward SMUD will only have a minor role in receiving payments and distributing revenues to the TANC members.

**Other Interconnection Agreements**

**Background.** SMUD’s electric system was originally purchased from PG&E in 1947. SMUD’s service area is mostly surrounded by PG&E’s and WAPA’s service areas. The SMUD and PG&E electric systems are interconnected at SMUD’s Rancho Seco and Lake 230-kV substations. SMUD and WAPA are interconnected at SMUD’s Hurley, Elverta, Natomas and Folsom 230-kV substations.

**PG&E Interconnection Agreement.** PG&E and SMUD executed a Replacement Interconnection Agreement (“RIA”) which became effective on January 1, 2010. The RIA provides that SMUD and PG&E operate their interconnections reliably, plan their electric systems to meet their load requirements, and avoid or mitigate impacts they cause by certain electric system modifications. The agreement has a termination date of December 31, 2024, subject to FERC approval. SMUD and other Northern California utilities have similar interconnection agreements with PG&E, albeit with different expiration dates. PG&E filed a successor interconnection agreement with one of these utilities, TID, on November 1, 2023, to become effective on January 1, 2024. Many interconnection customers, including SMUD, intervened and submitted comments or protests in the FERC docket. FERC accepted the filing and TID and PG&E are now in a settlement process, pending litigation of the parties cannot resolve the disputed items. SMUD anticipates that PG&E will seek to negotiate a successor interconnection agreement with SMUD which will be informed by the TID settlement or litigation process. While some functional mechanisms in the interconnection agreement may change, SMUD expects that its successor interconnection agreement will substantially preserve the balance of burdens and benefits consistent with FERC’s standard of requiring rates and terms of service that are just and reasonable. SMUD expects this process to be completed by the current expiration date of the RIA.

**PG&E Generator Interconnection Agreements.** SMUD signed a LGIA with CAISO and PG&E for the Solano 3 Wind Project, effective December 16, 2008, with a 50-year term. The Solano 2 Wind Project has interconnection rights granted through a LGIA, also with the CAISO and PG&E. The agreement became effective in January 2010 and has a term of 20 years. On June 3, 2021, SMUD entered into a LGIA with the CAISO and PG&E, for the planned 90.8 MW Solano 4 Wind project with a 10-year term and automatic renewal for successive one-year terms thereafter. On February 27, 2023, SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process which combines the Solano 2, 3 & 4 projects into one Solano Wind Project. The original agreement conditions for the individual projects are carried forward with

A–45
<!-- Page 631 -->
a new combined project maximum production limit of 320.8 MW at the point of interconnection at the Russell Substation.

Other PG&E generator interconnection agreements include a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for Slab Creek with a 22-year term which became effective on January 14, 2010, and a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for the Chili Bar Project with a 10-year term which became effective on June 2, 2021.

WAPA Interconnection Agreement and other WAPA Agreements. SMUD and WAPA executed an interconnection agreement on May 8, 2008 for a term of 40 years which establishes the terms and conditions under which the SMUD and WAPA transmission systems are interconnected and memorializes related understandings. SMUD is working with WAPA on a reconfiguration at the shared Elverta interconnection to increase reliability and accommodate new generation interconnection in the area. SMUD has other agreements with WAPA including for operation of the Sutter Energy Center generating facility, communication systems terms and fiber optic access, training and for use of WAPA labor and heavy equipment to assist SMUD’s maintenance activities on an as-available basis.

# Management’s Discussion of SMUD’s Operating Results

## Year Ended December 31, 2023
For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $218.1 million as compared to an increase of $70.7 million for 2022.

Operating revenues were $228.5 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower sales of surplus gas ($118.3 million), transfers to the RSF ($67.2 million), sales to customers ($28.3 million), transfers from the RSF ($21.9 million), and LCFS revenue ($3.9 million), partially offset by higher sales of surplus power ($136.6 million), AB 32 revenue ($3.7 million), customer fees ($1.1 million), and lower transmission revenue ($2.3 million).

Operating expenses were $292.8 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower purchased power expenses ($175.5 million), production operating expenses ($146.4 million), depreciation expenses ($22.7 million), production maintenance expenses ($12.3 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($7.2 million), partially offset by higher administrative and general expenses ($33.4 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($15.8 million), public good expenses ($8.8 million), and customer service and information expenses ($6.6 million).

Non-Operating income increased by $55.2 million primarily due to fair market value assessment and gain on sale of land ($33.3 million), higher interest income ($21.7 million), higher unrealized holding gains ($11.4 million), higher CCA revenue ($5.7 million), partially offset by lower investment income ($39.1 million).

Interest expense decreased $27.9 million from 2022.

## Year Ended December 31, 2022
For the year ended December 31, 2022, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $70.7 million as compared to an increase of $347.3 million for 2021.

Operating revenues were $363.0 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher sales to customers ($130.7 million), sales of surplus gas ($96.0 million), sales of surplus power ($62.2 million), transfers to the RSF ($28.9 million), transfers from the RSF ($24.3 million), customer fees ($9.5 million), AB 32 revenue ($4.9 million) and LCFS revenue ($2.2 million), partially offset by lower gain on sale of carbon allowance futures ($3.7 million).

Operating expenses were $601.2 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher purchased power expenses ($263.6 million), amortization of pension and OPEB ($126.9 million), production operating expenses ($125.1 million), depreciation expenses ($49.5 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($22.1 million), production maintenance expenses ($18.4 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($8.1 million), public good expenses ($7.4 million), and customer service and information expenses ($4.5 million), partially offset by lower administrative and general expenses ($27.4 million).

Non-Operating income decreased by $19.0 million primarily due to lower grant revenue ($39.6 million), unrealized holding losses ($3.7 million), partially offset by higher investment income ($19.7 million), closeout of escrow account ($2.8 million), and loss on asset retirements ($1.9 million).

Interest expense increased $19.5 million from 2021.

## Regulatory Assets
In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” SMUD defers, as regulatory assets, certain types of expenditures. These assets are amortized and collected through future rates.

As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had a total of $916.1 million recorded for regulatory assets. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 68 which requires SMUD to record a net pension liability was $323.5 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 68 was $174.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 75 which requires SMUD to record a net Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) liability was $268.2 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 75 was $39.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with Rancho Seco decommissioning costs totaled $108.0 million at December 31, 2023. Nuclear fuel storage costs and non-radiological decommissioning costs have been collected in rates since 2009. For a complete description of these regulatory assets, see Note 8 (Regulatory Deferrals) to SMUD’s financial statements.

The Board has authorized the deferral of any charges or credits that result from the change in valuation of ineffective hedges that should be reported as Investment Revenue/Expense on the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and changes in net position. The Board’s resolution establishes that such charges or credits are not included in rates based on market value changes but are included in rates when the underlying transactions occur. Therefore, under GASB No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” any such changes are included in the Statement of Net Position as regulatory assets or liabilities. For a complete description of these derivative financial instruments, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s financial statements.

**RANCHO SECO DECOMMISSIONING**

**Overview.** The 913 MW Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant (“Rancho Seco”) began operation in 1970 and was licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”). In June 1989, the NRC issued a notice of violation against allowing SMUD to continue to operate Rancho Seco as a nuclear generating facility, and the plant was shut down. In 1991, SMUD submitted a report (the “Financial Assurance Plan”) providing financial assurance to the NRC that SMUD will have sufficient funds available to pay for the cost of decommissioning. On March 17, 1992, the NRC granted SMUD a change from operating to a possession-only license for Rancho Seco that relieved SMUD from compliance with a number of NRC regulations applicable to operating nuclear power plants. SMUD also filed a proposed decommissioning plan with the NRC (the “Decommissioning Plan”), which was approved in March 1995.

After the decommissioning efforts began, no suitable disposal option was available to SMUD for the Class B and Class C low level radioactive waste generated during the plant decommissioning. With the used nuclear fuel stored onsite requiring oversight staff, SMUD opted to store the Class B and Class C radioactive waste in an existing interim onsite storage building until a suitable disposal option was available. In November 2007, the possession-only license for Rancho Seco was amended to update the Decommissioning Plan to terminate the possession-only license for the Class B and Class C waste in two phases. Phase I of the decommissioning was completed at the end of 2008. Following verification of the site conditions, SMUD submitted a request to the NRC to reduce the licensed facility from 2,480 acres to the interim onsite storage building and about one acre surrounding it. The request was approved by the NRC in September 2009. Phase II of decommissioning included the approximately two-acre interim storage building containing the Class B and Class C radioactive waste and surrounding area. In September 2013, SMUD entered into a contract with the operator of the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility located in Andrews, Texas. Shipment of the Class B and Class C radioactive waste for disposal was completed in November 2014. SMUD conducted additional clean-up activities and radiological surveys, which were followed by NRC confirmatory surveys. The results of these surveys demonstrated unit dose criteria well below NRC release criteria, and the NRC approved the Phase II area for unrestricted use. On September 21, 2017, SMUD formally requested the termination of the possession-only license. On August A-51

31, 2018, the NRC officially terminated SMUD’s possession-only license for the remaining Class B and Class C waste at Rancho Seco.

As part of the Decommissioning Plan, the nuclear fuel and Greater Than Class C (“GTCC”) radioactive waste is being stored in a dry storage facility (the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation or “ISFSI”) constructed by SMUD, adjacent to the former reactor facility. The NRC has separately licensed this facility. The DOE, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, is responsible for permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel and GTCC radioactive waste. SMUD has a contract with the DOE for the removal and disposal of this waste. The DOE was to have a waste repository operating by 1998, but has experienced significant and ongoing delays. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act designates Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the final and exclusive repository for the nation’s used nuclear fuel. The DOE discontinued the Yucca Mountain license review activities in 2010, but after a court ordered the NRC to resume its review in 2013, the NRC published its final safety evaluation report in 2015. The final safety report, and the final environmental impact statement, concluded that the proposed repository would be safe and environmentally sound for one million years.

Nevertheless, seeking alternatives to Yucca Mountain, the Blue-Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future delivered its final report in January 2012 with several recommendations. The DOE responded to the recommendations by issuing a report in January 2013 (Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste). Key to both documents is a focus on used fuel from decommissioned sites including Rancho Seco. The DOE report accepts most of the Blue-Ribbon Commission recommendations, and contains timelines for fuel management options which proposed removing the fuel from Rancho Seco as early as 2021. However, any progress on the strategies proposed by the DOE is dependent on legislative action by Congress. With no legislative action taken to this time when the DOE will fulfill its contractual obligations to remove the nuclear fuel and GTCC waste from the Rancho Seco facility. In the meantime, SMUD continues to incur costs of approximately $5 to $7 million per year for storage of used nuclear fuel at the ISFSI. SMUD has filed a series of successful lawsuits against the federal government for recovery of past spent fuel costs. SMUD last recovered over $14 million in 2023. SMUD plans to continue pursuing cost recovery claims to ensure it is reimbursed for all such costs in the future. The ISFSI will be decommissioned, and its license terminated after the fuel and GTCC is removed.

Financial Assurance Plan. In accordance with the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD established and funded an external decommissioning trust fund currently held by Computershare Corporate Trust (the “Decommissioning Trust Fund”). Pursuant to the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD made the final deposit into the Decommissioning Trust Fund in 2008. Additional deposits are not expected but will be made if increased cost estimates or reduced fund interest earnings require it. In 2011, the NRC began requiring that SMUD demonstrate financial assurance for decommissioning the ISFSI as well as the former power facility, increasing the overall cost for decommissioning Rancho Seco. The estimated total cost for decommissioning the ISFSI was approximately $7.1 million on December 31, 2023. The decommissioning cost estimate is required to be updated every three years. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the Decommissioning Trust Fund was $9.4 million, excluding unrealized gains and losses. Based on the current decommissioning cost estimate and the value of the fund, SMUD’s existing Decommissioning Trust Fund provides sufficient funds to complete decommissioning and terminate the ISFSI license.

In addition to these costs, SMUD also estimates that it would cost approximately $13.1 million to restore the site to make it available for other SMUD uses with some major structures remaining intact. Site restoration is not a legal requirement. No site restoration is currently underway.

SMUD participates in PERS, an agent multiple-employer public employee defined benefit plan. PERS provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. PERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State. Benefit provisions are established by State statute and SMUD policies. The pension plan provides retirement benefits, survivor benefits, and death and disability benefits based upon employees’ years of credited service, age, and final compensation.

As of June 30, 2022, the last actuarial valuation date for SMUD’s plan within PERS, the market value of the SMUD plan assets was $2.32 billion. The plan is 87.8% funded on a market value of assets basis, a decrease of 12.3% compared to the June 30, 2021 funded status based on the market value of assets.

As an employer, SMUD is required to contribute a percentage of payroll each year to PERS to fund SMUD’s plan based on actuarial valuations performed by PERS. PERS collects the normal cost based on a percentage of payroll and the unfunded liability portion is based on a dollar amount. SMUD also makes partial contributions required of SMUD employees on their behalf and for their account. At the PERS fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, SMUD’s required employer contribution rate for normal cost was 9.8% of payroll and the unfunded liability contribution was $22.4 million. During 2023, SMUD contributed $37.4 million to PERS (including SMUD’s contributions to cover required employee contributions), and SMUD employees paid $18.3 million for their share of the PERS contribution.

For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025, SMUD is required to contribute 9.6% and 9.5% of payroll for normal costs and $10.7 million for fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 for the unfunded liability contribution. There is no estimated employer contribution to the unfunded liability for fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Assuming no amendments to the plan and no liability gains or losses (which can have a significant impact), PERS has projected that SMUD will be required to contribute 9.4% of payroll to the plan for normal costs and $15.7 million for the unfunded liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions. The amount SMUD is required to contribute to PERS is expected to increase in the future. The actual amount of such increases

SMUD has the option to prepare an annual lump sum payment to PERS for the unfunded accrued liability portion only (not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions). SMUD made an annual lump sum prepayment of $19.5 million, and also voluntarily made an additional payment of $47.3 million, for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. SMUD was not required to make an annual lump sum prepayment and, to date, has not voluntarily made additional payments for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

While SMUD has some ability to adjust the retirement benefits provided to its employees, PERS determines the actuarial methods and assumptions used with respect to assets administered by PERS (including the SMUD plan assets) and makes the investment decisions with respect to such assets. For a description of such actuarial methods and assumptions (including the smoothing conventions used by PERS when setting employer contribution rates) and investments, see the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS (SMUD’s plan is part of the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund of PERS) available on its website at www.calpers.ca.gov. SMUD cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information and neither the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS nor any other information contained on the PERS website is incorporated by reference in or part of this Official Statement. Actuarial assessments are “forward-looking” information that reflect the judgment of the fiduciaries of the pension plans, and are based upon a variety of assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be inaccurate or be changed in the future. Actuarial assessments will change with the future experience of the pension plans.

GASB issued Statement No. 68 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – An Amendment of GASB Statement No. 27” (“GASB No. 68”). The primary objective of GASB No. 68 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for pensions. Under GASB No. 68, SMUD is required to report the net pension asset or net pension liability (i.e., the difference between the total pension liability and the pension plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of investment gains and losses. GASB No. 68 separates financial reporting from funding requirements for pension plans. The pension liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is $259.0 million and $235.5 million, respectively.

SMUD provides its employees with two cash deferred compensation plans: one pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 401(k) (the “401(k) Plan”) and one pursuant to IRC Section 457 (the “457 Plan” and collectively, the “Plans”). The Plans are contributory plans in which SMUD’s employees contribute the funds. Each of SMUD’s eligible full-time or permanent part-time employees may participate in either or both Plans, and amounts contributed by employees are vested immediately. Such funds are held by a trustee in trust for the employees upon retirement from SMUD service and, accordingly, are not subject to the general claims of SMUD’s creditors. SMUD makes annual contributions to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of certain employees pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with both of its collective bargaining units. SMUD matches the non-represented employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to a set amount. SMUD also makes limited discretionary contributions to non-represented employees hired after January 1, 2013, which contributions fully vest after five years. Prior to 2022, SMUD did not match employee contributions, nor make contributions on behalf of its employees to the 457 Plan. Beginning in 2022, SMUD makes annual contributions to the 457 Plan on behalf of certain employees and matches employee contributions up to a set amount pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with one of its collective bargaining units. SMUD made contributions to both Plans of $6.9 million in 2023 and to the 401(k) Plan of $7.0 million in 2022. Participating employees made contributions into both Plans totaling $34.3 million in 2023 and $32.4 million in 2022.

![Other Post-Employment Benefits](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Other+Post-Employment+Benefits)

**Other Post-Employment Benefits**

SMUD provides post-employment healthcare benefits, in accordance with SMUD policy and negotiated agreements with employee representation groups in a single employer defined benefit plan, to all employees who retire from SMUD, and their dependents. SMUD also provides post-employment healthcare benefits to covered employees who are eligible for disability retirement. SMUD contributes the full cost of coverage for retirees hired before January 1, 1991, and a portion of the cost based on credited years of service for retirees hired after January 1, 1991. SMUD also contributes a portion of the costs of coverage for these retirees’ dependents. Retirees are required to contribute the portion that is not paid by SMUD. The benefits, benefit levels, retiree contributions and employer contributions are governed by SMUD and can be amended by SMUD through its personnel manual and union contracts.

SMUD’s post-employment health care benefits are funded through the PERS California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (“CERBT”), an agent multiple-employer plan. The funding of a plan occurs when the following events take place: the employer makes payments of benefits directly to or on behalf of a retiree or beneficiary; the employer makes premium payments to an insurer; or the employer irrevocably transfers assets to a trust or other third party acting in the role of trustee, where the plan assets are dedicated to the sole purpose of the payments of the plan benefits, and creditors of the government do not have access to those assets.

SMUD has elected to contribute the normal costs to the CERBT but annually receive reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT. In 2024, SMUD’s contribution for the normal costs to CERBT is $10.6 million. In 2023, SMUD made a contribution to the CERBT for normal costs in the amount of $8.6 million. In 2022, SMUD decided to forgo making a contribution for the normal costs to the CERBT because there was a net OPEB asset as of December 31, 2021. SMUD made additional contributions to the trust. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD made healthcare benefit contributions by paying actual medical costs of $24.7 million and $24.5 million, respectively. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD received $24.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively, reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT.

At June 30, 2023 and 2022, SMUD estimated that the actuarially determined accumulated post-employment benefit obligation was approximately $403.6 and $381.7 million, respectively. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the plan was 92.3% and 97.9% funded, respectively.

SMUD’s actuary uses PERS economic and other assumptions as the basis for the calculation of the post-employment benefit obligation. The actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will vary substantially if such PERS assumptions, such as interest rate and life expectancy, among others, prove to be inaccurate or different than SMUD’s actual experience. Although SMUD believes that such assumptions and estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that any such assumptions will prove to be accurate, or that SMUD’s actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will not materially exceed its estimates. Additional information is available in Note 15 (Other Postemployment Benefits) and “Required Supplementary Information” to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

GASB previously issued SGAS No. 75 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions”. The primary objective of GASB No. 75 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for post-employment benefits other than pensions (“OPEB”). Under GASB No. 75, SMUD is required to report the net OPEB asset or net OPEB liability (i.e., the difference between the total OPEB liability and the OPEB plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of

**Outstanding Indebtedness**

**General.** SMUD typically finances its capital requirements through the sale of revenue bonds, the sale of commercial paper, from draws on its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and from internally generated funds. With the enactment of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2024 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, SMUD is monitoring and exploring new methods of financing, including those afforded under these two federal laws, that provide not-for-profit public power utilities with direct federal incentive payments.

SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Senior Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 (the “Senior Resolution”) adopted in 1971, as amended and supplemented (the “Senior Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Senior Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $1,783,965,000 outstanding. The Senior Bonds are payable solely from the Net Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Senior Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of “Maintenance and Operation Costs” and “Energy Payments” as defined in the Senior Resolution, including payments by SMUD to TANC under PA3, payments by SMUD under power purchase agreements related to the Authorities and payments by SMUD to NCGA and NCEA under their respective gas supply contracts. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD’s Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the “Subordinated Resolution”).
<!-- Page 642 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

“Subordinate Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Subordinated Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds.

SMUD issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of March 21, 2024, SMUD’s Notes were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes (and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit) are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD also entered into a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank and issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes thereunder (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in February 2022. As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future. SMUD’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

Joint Powers Authorities. SMUD has entered into long-term take-or-pay purchase agreements with SFA relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Under such agreements, SMUD has exclusive control of the dispatch of all five of the Local Gas-Fired Plants and takes all of the power produced by the Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” The Authorities are each treated as component units of SMUD for accounting purposes. Only SFA has outstanding debt, which relates solely to the Cosumnes Power Plant and is payable solely from capacity payments made by SMUD under the related power purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2023, bonds issued by SFA to finance the Cosumnes Power Plant were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $87,890,000. SMUD’s payments under the power purchase agreements relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal of and interest on the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the
<!-- Page 643 -->
![NCGA bonds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=NCGA+bonds)

NCGA bonds. As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $120,070,000 remain outstanding.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCEA as a joint powers authority. NCEA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCEA issued $539,615,000 in bonds in December 2018 for the purpose of paying J. Aron & Company LLC in advance for natural gas or electricity to be delivered to NCEA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas or electricity supplies delivered by NCEA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the NCEA bonds. [As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $537,295,000 remain outstanding. As described in the forepart of this Official Statement, the bonds issued by NCEA in 2018 are expected to be refunded with proceeds of the Bonds (as defined in the forepart of this Official Statement.)] [to be revised for 2024 Senior Bond offering documents]

**Interest Rate Swap Agreements.** SMUD has two interest rate swap agreements relating to previously or currently outstanding Subordinated Bonds, as shown in the following table. For more information, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

| Effective Date | Termination Date | SMUD Pays | SMUD Receives | Notional Amount (000's) | Counterparty |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 7/2/1997       | 7/1/2024         | Floating  | SIFMA          | 5.154%                  | $19,570      | J Aron & Company LLC |
| 07/12/2023     | 08/15/2041       | Fixed     | 0.718% [70% of 1M SOFR] | 132,020                | Barclays Bank |

The obligations of SMUD under the swap agreements are not secured by a pledge of revenues of SMUD’s electric system or any other property of SMUD. SMUD does not currently have any collateral posting requirements with respect to the interest rate swap agreements, but SMUD may be required to post collateral under certain circumstances.

**Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments.** SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”) and Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series W (the “2010 Series W Bonds”) were issued as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. At the time the 2009 Series V Bonds and 2010 Series W Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive an annual cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. However, as a result of the federal budget process, many payments from the federal government, including Build America Bonds subsidy payments, have been reduced. Absent the federal budget reductions, the aggregate annual cash subsidy payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds would be approximately $9.8 million. With the current federal budget reductions, SMUD has typically been receiving aggregate annual cash subsidy payments with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds of approximately $9.2 million. It is possible that future federal budget actions could further reduce, or eliminate entirely, the annual cash subsidy payments with respect to Build America Bonds, including the annual cash subsidy payments payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. SMUD cannot predict the likelihood of the further reduction or elimination of the Build America Bonds subsidy payments. A significant reduction or elimination of the cash subsidy.

# INSURANCE

SMUD maintains a comprehensive property/casualty insurance program designed to protect against catastrophic losses that would have an adverse effect on its financial position or operational capabilities. Insurance programs are continuously reviewed and modified when construction, operational exposures, or developments in the insurance industry so warrant. Long-term relationships with a variety of insurers minimize SMUD’s susceptibility to the effects of market cycles. SMUD budgets reserves to meet potential insurance deductibles and self-insured liability claims.

SMUD safeguards assets with all-risk property and boiler/machinery insurance with limits of $800 million per occurrence for physical damage and business interruption combined. Various coverage sublimits and deductibles apply to losses arising from certain perils, such as business interruption, earthquake, or flood, respectively. Liability insurance is in effect to defend and indemnify SMUD against third party claims, including general, automobile and sudden and accidental pollution claims with policy limits of $140 million, and wildfire coverage with policy limits of $275 million, all of which include a variety of self-insured retentions.

Nuclear property and liability insurance policies are maintained in accordance with the NRC’s requirements for decommissioned nuclear plants that maintain dry storage of spent fuel on-site. This includes $100 million in first party property damage and decontamination, $100 million for nuclear liability arising from accidents on-site, $200 million for supplier’s and transporter’s nuclear liability, and $300 million for nuclear worker liability. SMUD is exposed to possible retrospective assessments for nuclear property events occurring at other nuclear facilities in the United States capped at ten times SMUD’s annual nuclear property premium (currently the maximum retrospective assessment is approximately $1,000,000).

Other types of insurance include non-owned aircraft liability, workers’ compensation, crime, cyber security, fidelity, fiduciary liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, professional errors and omissions, transportation, and builder’s risk for major facilities under construction.

# LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

SMUD is a party to numerous actions arising out of the conduct of its business and affairs, some of which are discussed below. SMUD believes that any losses or adverse financial results it may suffer in these current actions, to the extent not covered by insurance, would not, in the aggregate, have an adverse material impact on SMUD, its business and affairs, or results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

## Environmental Litigation

SMUD was one of many potentially responsible parties that had been named in a number of actions relating to environmental claims and/or complaints. SMUD has resolved these environmental claims and/or complaints and entered into settlement agreements and/or consent orders. These settlement agreements and consent orders have statutory reopener provisions which allow regulatory agencies to seek additional funds for environmental remediation under certain limited circumstances. While SMUD believes it is unlikely that any of the prior settlements or consent orders will be reopened, the possibility exists. If any of the settlements or consent orders were to be reopened, SMUD believes that the outcome will not have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

## Proposition 26 Lawsuit

In October 2019, two SMUD customers jointly filed a complaint against SMUD (subsequently one of the customers removed themselves from the complaint), which stated that SMUD’s Board violated

A-60
<!-- Page 646 -->
![Proposition 26](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Proposition+26)

**Proposition 26** (see “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Proposition 26” for a description of Proposition 26) when on June 24, 2019, it adopted rate increases for 2020 and 2021. The plaintiff contended the rates did not reflect SMUD’s reasonable cost of service because they included a 9.2% scalar that SMUD applies to its TOD residential rate restructure adopted by SMUD’s Board in the 2017 rate process. SMUD viewed the lawsuit as having little merit and while SMUD anticipated the court would rule in SMUD’s favor on substantive grounds, the plaintiff in early 2024 agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice due to their failure to diligently prosecute the case. On January 16, 2024, the court approved the dismissal.

On January 19, 2024, the same plaintiff, along with a second SMUD residential customer, jointly filed a new complaint challenging the September 21, 2023, SMUD Board adoption of 2024 and 2025 rate increases. The plaintiffs make a similar claim regarding the TOD scalar as the prior lawsuit. Given the little merit behind the lawsuit, SMUD believes the court will rule in its favor. However, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the case or, if to the extent SMUD ultimately is not successful in the litigation, what remedies against SMUD may be available. SMUD believes that if it is not successful in the litigation, and to the extent the outcome would have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, the Board would make appropriate rate modifications based on an evidentiary record consistent with guidance from a judicial decision in the case.

**Other Litigation Matters**

Currently, SMUD is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints relating to its operations, including, but not limited to, property damage, personal injury, contract disputes, and employment matters. SMUD believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

**FERC Administrative Proceedings**

SMUD is involved in a number of FERC administrative proceedings related to the operation of wholesale energy markets, regional transmission planning, gas transportation and NERC reliability standards. These proceedings generally fall into the following categories: (i) filings initiated by the CAISO (or other market participants) to adopt/modify the CAISO Tariff and/or establish market design and behavior rules; (ii) filings initiated by existing transmission owners (i.e., PG&E and the other IOUs) to pass-through costs to their existing wholesale transmission customers; (iii) filings initiated by FERC to market participants to establish market design and behavior rules or investigate market behavior by certain market participants; (iv) filings initiated by transmission owners under their transmission owner tariffs to establish a regional transmission planning process; (v) filings initiated by providers of firm gas transportation services under the Natural Gas Act; and (vi) filings initiated by NERC to develop reliability standards applicable to owners, users, and operators of the bulk electric system. In addition, SMUD is an active participant in other FERC administrative proceedings, including those related to reliability, variable resource integration and the changing resource mix, and transmission planning and cost allocation. SMUD believes that determinations of these FERC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

**CPUC Administrative Proceedings**

Periodically, PG&E seeks to update its gas transmission and storage (“GT&S”) revenue requirements and rate designs. These applications are litigated at the CPUC and affect SMUD through several tariff rates SMUD pays to move natural gas along PG&E’s backbone transmission lines. In the 2019 GT&S rate case (the “2019 GT&S Case”), the CPUC affirmed the application in GT&S rates of cost causation principles to prevent excessive and unreasonable costs being shifted to electric generator. 

A-61

backbone customers like SMUD, either through proposed changes in PG&E’s natural gas storage strategy or through cost shifts within the electric generator customer class.

PG&E filed its 2023 General Rate Case (the “GRC”) in June 2021 which includes its gas transmission and storage revenue requirements. In September 2021, PG&E filed an application for approval of its Gas Cost Allocation and Rate Design Proposals (“CARD”). The CPUC issued a decision in the GRC in November 2023 authorizing PG&E’s revenue requirements for the four-year rate period of 2023-2026. SMUD is a party to the comprehensive all-party settlement agreement submitted to the CPUC for approval in June 2023 which, if approved, would resolve all open issues in the CARD proceeding. SMUD does not believe that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. SMUD will continue to actively participate in PG&E’s GRC and CARD proceedings to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to non-core customers, including electric generator backbone customers.

In the GRC, the CPUC directed PG&E to submit an application to revise its natural gas curtailment procedures “similar to the curtailment procedures of other large energy utilities”. SMUD will actively participate in this future proceeding.

Separately, SMUD continues to participate and monitor a proceeding at the CPUC concerning long-term gas system planning. At this point in these proceedings, SMUD does not anticipate that the resolution of such cases will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

SMUD monitors a number of other CPUC proceedings. These proceedings generally fall into three categories: (i) filings initiated by PG&E to adopt/modify its tariffs and/or rules; (ii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish market design and behavior rules or program rules affecting SMUD customers; and (iii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish electric and/or gas system safety design and maintenance rules. SMUD believes that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

# DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR

## California Electric Market

In 1996, the State partially deregulated its electric energy market and the CAISO was established in 1998. Since the CAISO’s formation, the State has experienced episodes of higher and more volatile prices for natural gas and wholesale electricity. In reaction to such conditions, SMUD made significant changes to its business strategy to mitigate the impacts of the more volatile and unpredictable energy markets. Volatility in energy prices in the State are always a potential risk due to a variety of factors which affect both the supply and demand for electricity in the western United States. These factors include, but are not limited to, the implementation of the CAISO market design changes, insufficient generation resources, the increase in intermittent renewable energy resources, natural gas price volatility, fuel costs and availability, weather and natural disasters, transmission constraints and levels of hydroelectric generation within the region. While SMUD has taken a number of steps to mitigate its exposure to price volatility associated with these factors, this price volatility under extreme conditions may contribute to greater volatility in SMUD’s net revenues from the purchase and sale of electric energy and, therefore, could materially adversely affect the financial condition and liquidity of SMUD. For a discussion of SMUD’s current resource planning activities and risk management strategies, see “BUSINESS STRATEGY” above.

# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity continues to be a top priority for SMUD. Attacks or threats directed at critical electric or energy sector operations could damage or cause the shut-down of generation, transmission or distribution assets that are essential to SMUD’s ability to serve its customers, cause operational malfunctions and outages affecting SMUD’s electric system, and result in costly recovery and remediation efforts. The costs of security measures or of remedying breaches could be material.

SMUD participates in sharing and receiving information about cyber security threats in real-time through the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (“E-ISAC”), the central hub for such data to actively manage risk related to potential cyber intrusion. SMUD also participates in NERC’s development of mandatory, enforceable cyber security standards to address vulnerabilities in electric utility NIST and through active engagement in the cyber security policy dialogue in Congress.

SMUD’s prudent response to this ever-changing threat requires constant monitoring and frequent updates to implement new regulatory requirements as they are developed. SMUD manages risk related to frequently changing regulatory requirements by participating in the development of standards at NERC and NIST.

# Physical Security

Physical security is a critical concern for electric utilities as they seek to protect their infrastructure from a range of threats. The electric utility infrastructure is complex and consists of multiple components, such as power plants, substations, transmission and distribution lines, and other facilities. SMUD employs a dedicated physical security team that is deployed 24/7 and allows SMUD to respond to emergent events in a safe, coordinated, efficient, and cohesive manner, protecting the lives of its employees, customers, community, properties and assets. SMUD has policies, processes and procedures in place that outline the access controls and restrictions for its properties. SMUD restricts access based on need as it determines, while adhering to applicable laws, regulations and standards such as NERC Reliability Standards and NRC regulations. SMUD also maintains a Utility Security Plan adopted by the Board representing SMUD’s compliance with the CPUC’s Safety and Enforcement Division six-step security plan process described in CPUC Decision 19-01-018.

During times of elevated, imminent threats, safety and/or security concerns, SMUD’s Security Operations team, under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer or delegate, reserves the right to deploy additional security measures, controls, and further restrict or limit access to its properties to increase its security posture.

SMUD operates a 24/7 security operations center which monitors and coordinates responses to situations reported by internal and external stakeholders, or which are detected by SMUD’s security technology. The technology includes access control, video surveillance, and various types of intrusion detection solutions. The security operations center is a central hub for initial contact for physical security calls from employees of suspicious events and initiates incident responses as needed.

# Federal Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings

## Energy Policy Act of 2005

On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct of 2005”) was signed into law. The law includes a number of energy-related provisions, including among other things limited FERC jurisdiction over interstate transmission assets of municipal utilities, cooperatives and federal utilities to order these entities to provide transmission services on rates and terms. 

A-63
<!-- Page 649 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Federal Regulation of Transmission Access.** The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the “Energy Policy Act”) made fundamental changes in the federal regulation of the electric utility industry, particularly in the area of transmission access. The Energy Policy Act provided FERC with the authority to require a transmitting utility to provide transmission services at rates, charges, terms and conditions set by FERC. The purpose of these changes, in part, was to bring about increased competition in the electric utility industry. Under the Energy Policy Act, electric utilities owned by municipalities and other public agencies which own or operate electric power transmission facilities which are used for the sale of electric energy at wholesale are “transmitting utilities” subject to the requirements of the Energy Policy Act.

Since the Energy Policy Act, FERC has adopted a series of rules to implement competitive open access to transmission facilities and regional transmission planning. Order No. 888, issued in 1996, requires the provision of open access transmission services on a nondiscriminatory basis by all “jurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does not include municipal entities like SMUD) by requiring all such utilities to file OATTs. Order No. 888 also requires “nonjurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does include SMUD) that purchase transmission services from a jurisdictional utility under an open access tariff and that owns or controls transmission facilities to provide open access service to the jurisdictional utility under terms that are comparable to the service that the nonjurisdictional utility provides itself. Section 211 of the EPAct of 2005 authorizes, but does not require, FERC to direct transmission utilities to provide transmission services, including rates and terms and conditions, that are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting utility provides transmission services to itself that are not unduly discriminatory or preferential – often referred to as the reciprocity rule.

In Order 890, issued in 2007, FERC stated that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis and retain the current reciprocity provisions.

In 2011, FERC issued Order 1000, which among other things requires public utility (jurisdictional) transmission providers to participate in a regional transmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan and that incorporates a regional and inter-regional cost allocation methodology. Similar to Order 890, FERC states that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis. However, in Order 1000, FERC appears to expand upon the current reciprocity provisions and states that it has the authority to allocate costs to beneficiaries of services provided by specific transmission facilities even in the absence of a contractual relationship between the owner of the transmission facilities and the identified beneficiary.

SMUD, individually, and through the Large Public Power Council (“LPPC”), appealed Order 1000, but in 2014 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the arguments raised on appeal, upholding the entirety of Order 1000.

The jurisdictional members of WestConnect filed their proposed regional planning process and cost allocation methodology through a series of compliance filings at FERC. FERC accepted binding cost allocation for jurisdictional transmission providers of WestConnect and mandated that non-jurisdictional transmission providers (such as SMUD) identified as beneficiaries of a project have the ability to not accept the cost allocation. WestConnect’s Order 1000 planning process began with the 2016-2017 planning cycle.

A-64
<!-- Page 650 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image) 

However, in response to FERC’s WestConnect orders on compliance, El Paso Electric Company (“El Paso”), a jurisdictional transmission provider, petitioned to the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. El Paso contends that FERC’s WestConnect orders violate Order 1000’s cost causation principle because WestConnect’s binding cost allocation applies only to the jurisdictional transmission providers and thus forces jurisdictional transmission providers to subsidize projects benefiting non-jurisdictional transmission providers that opt-out of projects. The non-jurisdictional transmission providers agreed on a settlement with the jurisdictional transmission providers to resolve the matters on appeal in the 5th Circuit, but FERC ultimately did not accept the settlement. On August 2, 2023, the court reversed FERC’s orders implementing Order No. 1000 for WestConnect concerning cost allocation of regional transmission projects to non-jurisdictional transmission providers. The court found that the WestConnect orders are incompatible with Order No. 1000’s application of the cost causation principle to address free ridership. There is uncertainty at this time on the future of WestConnect’s regional planning process. FERC has not yet acted on its own in light of the Fifth Circuit’s decision, and it is uncertain whether it will act while it is working on an updated transmission planning and cost allocation proposal that could change the Order 1000 process (as further discussed below regarding the April 21, 2022 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking). It is also uncertain if and/or the extent to which the jurisdictional transmission providers in WestConnect will file revisions to the regional transmission planning provisions in their OATTs. In the meantime, the WestConnect planning has continued under the existing framework and SMUD, along with the other non-jurisdictional transmission providers, continue to participate in the WestConnect process. SMUD’s longstanding objective is to comply with open access requirements necessary to achieve reciprocity, including through participation in a regional planning process while binding itself to mandatory cost allocation. Thus, SMUD has an interest in continuing to explore options for participation in a regional transmission planning process if the WestConnect rules are modified to permit SMUD to reasonably participate consistent with its business and jurisdictional interests.

SMUD is unable to predict at this time the full impact that Order 1000, or the 5th Circuit’s August decision, will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the WestConnect process generally. However, WestConnect has conducted multiple planning cycles under its Order 1000 planning process and has not identified any project eligible for cost allocation. SMUD will continue to take any action necessary, including withdrawing from a cost allocation determination or planning region, and engaging in FERC proceedings, to ensure that it is not required to pay for transmission costs in the absence of an agreement or service relationship.

On April 21, 2022, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation and Generator Interconnection (the “NOPR”). The NOPR seeks input on proposals that would impact the Order 1000 planning and cost allocation process. SMUD has been engaged in the proceeding, providing input and helping draft comments with trade organizations, including LPPC. FERC has not issued any subsequent order. SMUD will continue to monitor and be engaged in any developments at FERC that impact the Order 1000 process and its regional transmission planning participation.

NERC Reliability Standards. The EPAct of 2005 required FERC to certify an electric reliability organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable reliability standards, subject to FERC review and approval. On February 3, 2006, FERC issued Order 672, which certified NERC as the ERO. Many reliability standards have since been approved by FERC, including those aimed at protecting the bulk electric system from physical and cyber threats.

The ERO or the regional entities, such as WECC, may enforce the reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight or FERC may independently enforce reliability standards. Potential monetary sanctions include fines of up to $1,544,521 per violation per day. Order 693 provides ERO and regional entities with 

A-65
<!-- Page 651 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

the discretion necessary to assess penalties for such violations, while also having discretion to calculate a penalty without collecting the penalty if circumstances warrant.

**Anti-Market Manipulation Rules.** EPAct of 2005 gave FERC the authority to issue rules to prevent market manipulation in jurisdictional wholesale power and gas markets, and in jurisdictional transmission and transportation services. These anti-market manipulation rules apply to non-jurisdictional entities such as SMUD. Further, EPAct of 2005 provided FERC civil penalty authority, which the Commission has stated that it will exercise carefully by assuring that its market manipulation rules are clear.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions.** Since 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions from different sources, including from the electric sector.

In 2014, EPA issued a proposed rule under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) called the Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”) that projected power sector emissions reductions of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed CPP would have established a rate-based emissions goal for each state, providing states the responsibility to develop a State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) describing how each will meet the goal assigned by EPA using the “Best System of Emissions Reduction” (“BSER”) established by EPA. The rule was finalized in October 2015.

In November 2015, 27 states and numerous corporations challenged the CPP in court, alleging that EPA had exceeded its authority under the CAA; however, before the issue could be decided by the court, the 2016 presidential election resulted in a change of administration. The new administration quickly moved for an abeyance (or stay) of the case for as long as the agency needed to review and withdraw the CPP. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP pending disposition in the D.C. Circuit and any subsequent review by the Supreme Court. In August 2018, EPA proceeded to withdraw the CPP and the D.C. Circuit ultimately dismissed the case on September 17, 2019. EPA proposed a different rule under the same provision of the CAA, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which would have established a BSER that only includes measures that can be undertaken at an individual power plant, rather than the broader suite of measures envisioned under the CPP. The ACE rule was challenged in court by environmental groups and states alleging that the revised rule inadequately responds to EPA’s responsibility to protect public health and welfare. SMUD joined in this litigation along with other challengers. The D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule on January 10, 2021, and remanded it to the EPA for review and revision, just days before a new presidential administration took office. Several states led by West Virginia and coal industry members appealed the decision.

In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in West Virginia v. EPA, striking down the CPP and foreclosing any future regulations of “significant political and economic significance” if Congress has not expressly authorized them. While the decision does not restrict EPA to only requiring measures “inside the fence line” at an individual power plant to control GHGs, it appears unlikely that the EPA will be able to require material reductions in GHGs to mitigate climate change through section 111(d) of the CAA.

Under the new presidential administration, in May 2023, the EPA issued a proposed rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA to reduce GHG emissions from existing and new power plants. The four-part proposed rule, **New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; and Repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy Rule**, would set both GHG emission standards for certain subcategories of new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants operating greater than 50% of the time and generating more than 300 MW per turbine. In the proposed rule, EPA determined the BSER is either deploying carbon capture and storage

technology to capture 90% of emissions or co-firing 96% hydrogen produced through a low-emission process (“low-GHG hydrogen”). If finalized, compliance is required by 2032. SMUD has filed comments as part of several trade groups and coalitions in response to the proposed rule. SMUD’s internal analysis shows the rule as proposed would not require changes at any of its currently-operating fossil-fueled power plants and therefore will not have a material impact on SMUD’s financial position, operations, or liquidity.

**Federal Communications Commission**

The 1978 Pole Attachment Act added section 224 to the Communications Act of 1934, authorizing the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to regulate attachments by cable television systems or providers of telecommunications service to utility poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way. Under Section 224(a)(1), public power entities are exempt from FCC pole attachment regulations, as municipally-owned poles are already subject to local decision-making processes and governance. The municipal exemption from FCC pole attachment regulations was further codified through the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, over the past decade, this exemption has been continuously eroded.

Various actions by the FCC have limited the exemption in support of a “uniform policy for broadband access to privately-owned physical infrastructure.” Through four orders issued between 2017 and 2018, the FCC set strict time limits for the review of pole attachment applications and preempted state and local agreements on pole attachments. In 2020, in *City of Portland v. United States*, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the FCC’s Small Cell Order, which adopted new time limits for municipal utilities’ review of wireless infrastructure siting applications and preempted access for small cell installations. In November 2023, the FCC adopted its Fourth Report and Order, Declaratory Ruling, and Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which established new rules and the timeline for the approval process for pole attachment applications, among other things. SMUD will monitor this proceeding for any potential impact to SMUD.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new FCC rulemakings will impact the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system.

**Federal Clean Energy Legislation.** SMUD actively participates in discussion at the federal level regarding legislation that would meaningfully impact SMUD’s existing GHG reduction strategies or impose new requirements for electric generators, including a proposed federal clean energy standard. In the 117th Congress, a clean electricity performance program was considered but ultimately lacked support to pass. Instead, Congress extended and expanded clean energy tax credits and created new grant and rebate programs to incentivize clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While it is possible that a future Congress may revisit the concept of a clean energy standard or other GHG reduction regime, it is possible that the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will diminish the likelihood of a new regulatory framework being enacted in the near future.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new EPA rulemakings will be undertaken, and what the full impact of the reduction of fossil-based generation over time will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the electric utility industry generally.

**State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings**

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills provide for reduced GHG emission standards and greater investment in energy efficient and environmentally friendly generation alternatives through more stringent RPS. Additionally, ongoing regulatory proceedings address the implementation of these bills as well as water flow and quality.

![Greenhouse Gas Emissions Summary](https://example.com/image.png)

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
On September 27, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (“AB 32”). AB 32 requires the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to adopt enforceable GHG emission limits and emission reduction measures in order to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In addition, AB 32 establishes a mandatory reporting program for all IOUs, local, publicly-owned electric utilities and other load-serving entities (electric utilities providing energy to end-use customers) (“LSEs”). The AB 32 reporting program allows CARB to adopt regulations using market-based compliance mechanisms such as a “cap-and-trade” system.

On December 16, 2010, CARB approved a resolution adopting cap-and-trade regulations for the State. The regulations became effective on January 1, 2012. As adopted, the cap-and-trade program covers sources accounting for 85% of the State’s GHG emissions, the largest program of its type in the United States. In November of 2012, CARB conducted its first allowance auction and auctions now occur on a quarterly schedule.

The cap-and-trade program introduced a hard emissions cap that declines over time on the combined electric utility and large industrial sectors, covering all sources emitting more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases (“CO2e”) per year, and was subsequently expanded to cover distributors of transportation, natural gas, and other fossil fuels. The cap-and-trade program requires covered entities to retire compliance instruments (allowances and carbon offsets) for each metric ton of CO2e they emit. CARB has allocated free allowances to LSEs to mitigate the compliance cost burden on ratepayers. The value of allowances must be used to benefit ratepayers and achieve GHG emission reductions. The cap-and-trade program also allows covered entities to use offsets for compliance purposes (not exceeding 8% of a regulated entity’s compliance obligation through 2020, 4% from 2021 through 2025, and 6% from 2026 through 2030). Offsets must be obtained from certified projects in sectors that are not regulated under the cap-and-trade program and are subject to other restrictions.

The State's cap-and-trade program was briefly linked to companion program in the Canadian province of Ontario during 2018 but was de-linked following a political change. In 2021, the Washington state legislature passed a cap-and-trade bill, which is expected to interact with the State’s markets. Future potential near-term links to the CARB cap-and-trade program also include the states of Oregon, which has adopted a cap-and-trade program, and New Mexico, which is considering the adoption of a cap-and-trade program.

On October 7, 2015, SB 350 was enacted, containing aggressive goals for reducing carbon emissions by 2030, including raising the proportion of renewable energy to 50%, reducing the use of petroleum fuel in cars and trucks by up to 50%, and doubling the energy efficiency of existing buildings. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” for additional information. In addition, SB 350 established requirements for larger POUs to adopt and file with the CEC Integrated Resource Plans (“IRPs”) by April 2019 that would show planned procurement to achieve the 50% RPS and State GHG goals established by CARB. The CEC developed “guidelines” for these IRPs for POUs in 2017, updated them in 2018, and proposed additional updates in 2022. CARB established specific GHG target ranges for these IRPs in summer 2018, which were revised in 2023 following the adoption of CARB’s 2022 Scoping Plan. SMUD developed and adopted an IRP in 2018 through a comprehensive public process and filed the adopted IRP with the CEC in April 2019. SMUD adopted an updated IRP in June 2022 and filed the updated IRP with the CEC in September 2022, but the CEC has not yet completed its review of SMUD’s 2022 IRP. SMUD’s updated IRP plans for a greater than 92% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 relative to 1990 levels, which equals approximately

250,000 metric tons of GHG emissions in 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change.”

On April 29, 2015, the Governor of the State signed Executive Order B-30-15, establishing a goal for the State to reduce GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2016, the State Legislature passed Senate Bill 32 (“SB 32”), which codified then-Governor Brown’s goal of reducing the State’s GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2017, the State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 398 (“AB 398”), explicitly authorizing the continuation of the cap-and-trade program, with designated changes, through 2030. Subsequently, CARB adopted an initial set of regulatory changes extending the cap-and-trade program, including establishing utility sector allowance allocations through 2030. In 2018, CARB completed a rulemaking to implement the cap-and-trade program changes designated by AB 398. These changes include development of a hard price ceiling for the cap-and-trade program and two price-containment points below that ceiling, in an attempt to ensure stable prices in the program. CARB adopted final regulations on December 13, 2018.

In addition, any new projects constructed in the State, including power plants, that may cause a significant adverse impact on the environment must be analyzed under CEQA. Some State agencies have begun using CEQA in novel ways to require mitigation of “significant” GHG emissions caused, either directly or indirectly, by a project. Pursuant to Senate Bill 97 passed in 2007, CARB will assist the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research in setting thresholds of significance under CEQA of GHG impacts from new projects. This is an area of State law that is evolving and unsettled in the courts. However, there is a risk that any project proponent of an electric system infrastructure project might have to mitigate such potential impacts to a level of less than significant.

On December 3, 2012, the Superior Court issued a ruling in Environmental Defense Fund v. San Diego Association of Governments (“SANDAG”), Case No. 2100-00101593, that sided with the State Attorney General and the other petitioners stating that SANDAG did not follow CEQA when it adopted a $257 billion regional transportation plan in 2011. The ruling expressly invalidated the certification of the Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) on the grounds that the EIR should have analyzed the plan’s consistency with the governor’s policy goal to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050 as articulated in the 2005 Executive Order S-03-05. On November 24, 2014, the Fourth Appellate District upheld the trial court in a published decision, and SANDAG appealed to the State Supreme Court. On July 13, 2017, the Supreme Court reversed and held that SANDAG’s decision to not adopt the 2050 goal was not an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, the Court articulated three clear principles for agencies to follow in their CEQA review of planning documents: 1) agencies must take seriously the significance of even small increases in GHG emissions; 2) they must consider science-based State policy guidance in their decision-making; and 3) they are required to use the best scientific information available to determine whether their planning decisions are consistent with the State’s goals. These principles will apply to SMUD in CEQA reviews of future projects.

On September 29, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law Senate Bill 1368 (“SB 1368”), the GHG Emissions Performance Standard (“EPS”). SB 1368 limits long-term investments in baseload generation by the State’s utilities to power plants that meet an EPS jointly established by the CEC and the CPUC. The agencies have set the EPS at 1,100 pounds CO2 per MWh, which is roughly half of the CO2 emissions rate of a conventional coal-fired power plant. CEC regulations to implement the law for POUs were approved by the Office of Administrative Law on October 16, 2007.

SMUD’s primary supply and demand-side resources need to meet customers’ electric usage patterns over the next 10 years. Currently there is a ban in the State that prohibits the development of nuclear power plants until there is a permanent storage solution for spent fuel rods. With the effective ban on new coal power imports under SB 1368, natural gas-fired, combined cycle power plants would appear

A-69
<!-- Page 655 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to be the primary viable option for fossil fuel-based baseload power plant development absent the implementation of new technologies in connection with other resource options. The reliance on a single fuel source will continue to put pressure on the natural gas market in the United States. SMUD has in place a natural gas procurement plan to mitigate natural gas volatility, see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply” above.

On September 16, 2022, the Governor of the State signed into law SB 1020, which creates interim climate targets under which eligible renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources must supply 90% of all retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers by December 31, 2035, and 95% by December 31, 2040. The bill also requires each State agency to ensure that zero carbon resources and eligible renewable energy resources supply 100% of electricity procured on its behalf by December 31, 2035. SMUD provides electricity to a number of State agency buildings and will work with State agencies to comply with this requirement.

On October 7, 2023, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 1305, which requires an entity that purchases or uses voluntary carbon offsets and makes claims regarding the achievement of net zero, or other similar claims, to disclose on their website specified information. Many stakeholder groups are raising questions on if this includes RECs. Clean-up legislation could follow. It is not clear at this time whether RECs are included.

Reliability. On June 30, 2022, the Governor signed the 2022-23 budget, along with a number of trailer bills, which provide implementing details on the budget line items. Included in AB 205, the energy trailer bill, are a number of reliability programs.

1. CEC Distributed Electricity Backup Assets Program to incentivize the construction of cleaner and more efficient distributed energy assets that would serve as on-call emergency supply or load reduction for the state’s electrical grid during extreme events. The CEC adopted program guidelines in October 2023 and issued the first solicitation in December 2023.

2. CEC Demand Side Grid Support Program to pay customers to reduce demand during stressed grid events. SMUD has actively engaged the CEC on the development and subsequent revision of program guidelines. The CEC is expected to revise the guidelines again for summer 2024.

3. DWR Strategic Reliability Reserve to secure resources for summer reliability or to preserve the option to extend the life of facilities that otherwise would retire, new temporary generators of more than five MW, new energy storage systems of at least 20 MW, generation facilities that use clean, zero-emission fuel technologies, or new zero-emission technologies that can be operational by December 31, 2026.

As a follow up to this legislation, the Governor signed into law AB 1373. The bill authorizes the CEC to annually assess a capacity payment on a POU within the CAISO balancing authority area during a month in which the POU fails to meet its minimum planning reserve margin. This does not include SMUD, who is within the BANC balancing authority area. SMUD is, however, required to submit to the CEC an assessment of whether it exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin and system resource adequacy requirements. This bill also allows the DWR, for certain types of long-development projects, to act as a central procurement entity. For POUs, participation in the DWR program would be optional.

Zero-Emission Fleet Mandates. CARB has adopted the Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”) regulation, requiring certain medium- and heavy-duty (“MHD”) vehicle fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles through purchase requirements or fleet composition requirements, which took effect on November

A-70
<!-- Page 656 -->
1, 2023, and applies to all publicly owned MHD fleets, larger commercially owned MHD fleets, and drayage trucks. Under the ACF Rule, public fleets like SMUD have two compliance options. The first is a zero-emission vehicle (“ZEV”) purchase requirement, under which 50% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2024, and 100% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2027. The second is an optional ZEV milestone option, under which the composition of the MHD fleet would need to meet certain ZEV percentages starting in 2025, with the entire fleet transitioned no later than 2042. The individual milestones depend on the number and category of vehicles in the fleet. Public fleets may opt into the ZEV milestone option until January 1, 2030. In 2024, SMUD plans to comply with the purchase requirement option, meaning that 50% of the MHD vehicles will be ZEVs. SMUD plans to monitor ZEV market developments and currently expects to opt into the ZEV milestone option as more ZEVs become available. The ACF Rule also accelerates a manufacturer ZEV sales requirement to 100% of all MHD truck sales by the 2036 model year.

CARB proposed the Zero-Emission Forklift regulation in November 2023. The regulation would require forklift fleets to transition spark-ignited forklifts to zero-emission technology starting in 2026. The regulation would apply to SMUD, as a forklift operator. Since SMUD has a limited number of forklifts, this regulation is not expected to have a material effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operation.

Transportation and Building Electrification. In recent years, the State has identified transportation and building electrification as key strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, and is advancing policy to support or accelerate electrification. For example, in addition to the zero-emission fleet mandates and LCFS regulations discussed herein, CARB adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks regulations to require vehicle manufacturers to increase sales of zero-emission vehicles and equipment, respectively. The CEC’s Building Energy Efficiency Standards are encouraging the use of electric heat pumps in new homes and certain non-residential buildings across the state. The draft 2025 Energy Standards, which are expected to be proposed by April 2024 and adopted by August 2024, would establish prescriptive heat pump requirements for both space and water heating in new homes, and may require existing homes to install a heat pump when replacing an air conditioner. The 2025 Energy Standards, if approved, would take effect on January 1, 2025. In addition, the State has also provided funding for programs to encourage clean transportation and building electrification.

Increases in transportation and building electrification will result in increased customer usage of electricity.

Renewables Portfolio Standard. Senate Bill 100 was passed by the Legislature and approved by Governor Brown on September 10, 2018. Among other requirements, the bill sets a 50% RPS target for 2026 and sets compliance period targets at 44% by December 31, 2024, 52% by December 31, 2027, and 60% by December 31, 2030. The bill also creates a statewide planning goal to meet all of the state’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.

Sacramento-San Joaquin River Bay-Delta Processes. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is an expansive inland estuary, formed at the western edge of the California Central Valley by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers (“Delta”). There are two substantial Delta planning processes with the potential to affect (1) energy available for SMUD’s purchase from the Central Valley Project (“CVP”) and (2) flows within the Upper American River watershed. These processes are called the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan (“Bay-Delta Plan”) and the Delta Conveyance Project.

The Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan is updated periodically by the State Water Resources Control Board (“SWRCB”), the last time being in 2006. The current Bay-Delta Plan update process is being implemented in four phases. The first phase considered southern Delta water quality, with a

A-71
<!-- Page 657 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)  
significant focus on San Joaquin River tributaries. Phase 2, which is initially being addressed by a document under development by SWRCB staff, will address Sacramento River tributaries and various flow related issues, including the critically important one of those tributaries’ contribution to Delta outflow. Phase 3 will concern changes to water rights needed to implement Phase 2. A substantial change in Delta outflow requirements could have a major impact on the timing of hydroelectric energy generation by the CVP. SMUD has a long-term agreement with WAPA to purchase some of this power (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration”). On July 18, 2018, the SWRCB released an updated Framework document signaling its staff’s intent to propose Delta outflow requirements of 45-65% unimpaired flows for the Sacramento River tributaries (which includes the American River, the upper portions of which are where the AQR sits), though the report will analyze requirements of 35-75%. If these criteria were implemented, they could cut CVP generation by 50 to 63%. Governor Newsom has urged the SWRCB, other agencies and affected parties to execute voluntary agreements (aka the “Healthy Rivers Agreements”) to address species’ needs and outflow requirements. Although the negotiations have been slow, it is expected they will eventually result in a reasonable compromise. However, in September 2023 the SWRCB released a Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document to justify the adoption of the unimpaired flow standard as set forth in the 2018 Framework document. Numerous public entities, including SMUD, filed comments stating that, among other things, the potential updates identified in the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document, if adopted, would violate the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act and Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution, would not protect fish and wildlife, and would not reasonably protect all beneficial uses, including water supplies for millions of Californians and hydroelectric power generation that is essential to California’s resilient energy grid. Moreover, the comments filed also stated that the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document does not comply with CEQA because, among other things, the analysis of the proposed minimum and unimpaired flows for Delta ecosystem health, species sustainability, and generally electrical grid reliability, is not supported by substantial evidence and fails to satisfy informational requirements. In addition, the comments maintain that the Healthy Rivers Agreements are a superior approach to achieving the goal of maximizing both environmental and other beneficial uses. If the unimpaired flow standard is adopted and the Healthy Rivers Agreements do not come to fruition, SMUD plans to fully participate in all regulatory and legal proceedings to argue for consideration and minimization of impacts to hydropower generation. SMUD will assess the potential impacts of proposed modifications to the present outflow objectives on SMUD’s operations once, or if, the SWRCB makes available information with enough specificity for SMUD to conduct the relevant modeling.

In July 2022, the DWR released a Draft Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) to evaluate the potential impacts of carrying out the Delta Conveyance Project; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a separate Environmental Impact Statement to evaluate the effects of the project pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The Delta Conveyance Project is expected to entail construction of two intakes on the Sacramento River that will carry water to a main tunnel to the California Aqueduct for delivery south of the Delta. The Delta Conveyance Project may pose the potential to exacerbate impacts to already imperiled aquatic species, and in turn could have indirectly prompted regulatory agencies to require third parties, such as SMUD, to compensate by making changes to their operations. The Bureau of Reclamation is not a party to the Delta Conveyance Project, which should eliminate the potential for CVP power to be used to supply Delta Conveyance Project pumps. SMUD will monitor the proceedings and participate as necessary to ensure any impacts to SMUD interests are minimized, including potentially filing a challenge to the water rights DWR would need to modify in order to carry out the project.

Proposition 26. Proposition 26 was approved by the electorate on November 2, 2010 and amends Article XIII A and Article XIII C of the State Constitution. Proposition 26 imposes a two-thirds voter approval requirement for the imposition of fees and charges by the State, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. It also imposes a majority voter approval requirement on local governments with  
A-72
<!-- Page 658 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**A-73**

**respect to fees and charges for general purposes, and a two-thirds voter approval requirement with respect to fees and charges for special purposes, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. The initiative, according to its supporters, is intended to prevent the circumvention of tax limitations imposed by the voters pursuant to Proposition 13, approved in 1978, and other measures through the use of non-tax fees and charges. Proposition 26 expressly excludes from its scope a charge imposed for a specific local government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable cost to the local government of providing the service or product. Proposition 26 is not retroactive as applied to local governments. Although SMUD believes that the initiative was not intended to apply to fees for utility services such as those charged by SMUD and its fees and charges meet the criteria of the exclusion described above, it is possible that Proposition 26 could be interpreted to further limit fees and charges for electric utility services and/or require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes. SMUD is unable to predict at this time how Proposition 26 will be interpreted by the courts or what its ultimate impact will be. As of the date of this Official Statement, SMUD is unaware of any fees or charges relating to SMUD’s service that would have to be reduced or eliminated because of Proposition 26. However, certain of SMUD’s adopted rate increases have been challenged. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”**

**Initiative 1935.** A voter initiative entitled “The Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act” (“Initiative 1935”) has been determined to be eligible for the State’s November 2024 statewide general election and, unless withdrawn by its proponent prior to June 27, 2024, will be certified as qualified for the ballot in such election. Were it to be approved by a majority of voters in the election, Initiative 1935 would amend Article XIII C of the State Constitution to, among other things, provide that charges (or increases in charges) imposed or extended by a local government after January 1, 2022 for services or products provided directly to the payor (including, potentially, fees and charges for electric service or product) are “taxes” subject to voter approval unless the local government can provide convincing evidence that the charge is reasonable and does not exceed the “actual cost” of providing the service or product. Initiative 1935 defines “actual cost” as “(i) the minimum amount necessary to reimburse the government for the cost of providing the service or the product to the payor and (ii) where the amount charged is not used by the government for any purpose other than reimbursing that cost.” Initiative 1935 would also require that local governments impose fees and charges by ordinance (which may be subject to judicial interpretation). SMUD is unable to predict whether and how Initiative 1935, if approved, would be interpreted or applied, but it is possible any such interpretation or application could further limit fees and charges or further increase in fees and charges for electric utility services, require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes and/or otherwise adversely impact SMUD and its revenues. In response to an emergency petition filed by Governor Gavin Newsom, with support from the League of California Cities and others, the California Supreme Court has unanimously agreed to decide whether the initiative should appear on the November 2024 ballot or be disqualified. A ruling is expected before June 30, 2024, which is the deadline for placing items on the November 2024 ballot. 

**On November 2, 2023, Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 13 (“ACA 13”) was filed with the Secretary of State and will be on the ballot for the November 2024 statewide general election. If approved by voters, ACA 13 would require any initiative constitutional amendment appearing on the ballot on or after January 1, 2024, that would increase the voter approval requirement to adopt any State or local measure to be approved by the highest voter approval requirement that the initiative measure would impose. In other words, if ACA 13 is approved by voters, its express terms appear to require Initiative 1935 to pass with a 2/3 vote, since Initiative 1935 would extend a 2/3 voter requirement to additional State and local fees and charges. If adopted, ACA 13 and its effect on the adoption of Initiative 1935, if applicable, are likely to be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is not able to predict whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would be interpreted or applied or whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would affect the adoption, interpretation or application of Initiative 1935, if adopted.**

![Wildfire Legislation](https://example.com/image-url)

**Wildfire Legislation.** In response to catastrophic wildfires in California, legislation was adopted and signed into law requiring POUs (including SMUD), IOUs, and electrical cooperatives to construct, maintain and operate their electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by electrical lines and equipment. Senate Bill 247 (“SB 247”), signed by Governor Newsom on October 2, 2019, establishes notification, audit and reporting guidelines for electrical corporations relating to vegetation management requirements in the wildfire mitigation plan. SB 247 also specifies the qualifications for electrical line clearance tree trimmers performing work to comply with the vegetation management requirements in an electrical corporation’s wildfire mitigation plan and requires that qualified line clearance tree trimmers be paid no less than a specified prevailing wage rate. POUs are not required to adhere to SB 247, but the market impacts are projected to significantly increase SMUD’s annual vegetation management costs.

**Nonstock Security.** SMUD sponsored legislation in 2019, Assembly Bill 689, which was signed into law by Governor Newsom on September 5, 2019. This bill expressly allows SMUD the ability to operate a pilot project (effective January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2025), of up to three acquisitions, to hold nonstock security in a corporation or other private entity if acquired as part of a procurement of goods or services from that entity, provided that no separate funding is expended solely for the purposes of that property. 

On September 15, 2022, the Board authorized the CEO & GM to enter into a joint collaboration agreement with ESS Tech, Inc. (“ESS”). Under that agreement SMUD would procure from ESS in flow batteries for utility scale long-duration energy storage applications. The agreement contemplates a multi-year phased deployment of up to 200MW/2GWh of long duration energy storage by 2028. As part of this procurement, SMUD acquired nonstock security in ESS.

SMUD will be sponsoring legislation in 2024 to extend the authority granted by Assembly Bill 689 to future years.

**Future Regulation**

The electric industry is subject to continuing legislative and administrative reform. States and Federal entities routinely consider changes to the way in which they regulate the electric industry. Recently, both further deregulation and forms of additional regulation have been proposed for the industry, which has been highly regulated throughout its history. SMUD is unable to predict at this time the impact any such proposals will have on the operations and finances of SMUD or the electric utility industry generally.

**OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY**

**CAISO Market Initiatives**

The CAISO routinely conducts a number of initiatives and stakeholder processes that propose certain operational and market changes that impact SMUD. SMUD does and will continue to monitor the various initiatives proposed by the CAISO and participate in its stakeholder processes to ensure that its interests are protected.

SMUD participates in the CAISO market for only a small percentage of energy needs, however, it continues to benefit from its participation in the CAISO’s WEIM and is currently exploring further participation in the CAISO’s proposed Extended Day Ahead Market (“EDAM”) (both the WEIM and EDAM are described further below). Along with monitoring other key market initiatives at the CAISO which impact wholesale energy markets, SMUD will continue to actively participate in all processes related

A-74
<!-- Page 660 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to EIM and EDAM, to ensure both participation models are beneficial to SMUD’s customers. Given its success in EIM and active engagement with the CAISO and CAISO leadership, SMUD has earned a key role in the stakeholder processes related to these important and evolving markets.

**Resource Adequacy Filing**

In September 2005, the State Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Assembly Bill 380 (“AB 380”), which requires the CPUC to establish resource adequacy requirements for all LSEs within the CPUC’s jurisdiction. SMUD is not an LSE subject to the CPUC’s jurisdiction. In 2005, the CPUC issued a decision requiring jurisdictional LSEs to demonstrate that they have acquired capacity sufficient to serve their forecast retail customer load plus a minimum 15% planning reserve margin. In June 2022, the CPUC issued a decision increasing the minimum planning reserve margin to 16% for 2023 and 17% for 2024. In June 2023, the CPUC kept the minimum planning reserve margin at 17% for 2024 and extended the 17% requirement for 2025.

AB 380 also required publicly owned utilities, including SMUD, to meet the most recent resource adequacy standard as adopted by the WECC. The WECC has yet to formally adopt a resource adequacy requirement. However, consistent with current WECC practices, SMUD utilizes a minimum 15% planning reserve margin when assessing the need for future resources. For summer 2023, SMUD attained a 17% planning reserve margin and will have at least a 17% planning reserve margin for summer 2024 as well.

In 2022, the State Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 209 (2022) (“AB 209”), which requires the CEC to develop recommendations about approaches to determining an appropriate planning reserve margin for local publicly owned utilities within the CAISO balancing authority area. The CEC has initiated a proceeding and plans to publish a report with a recommended methodology on summer 2024. The report will not directly impact SMUD since SMUD is not in the CAISO; nevertheless, SMUD is monitoring the proceeding. The State Legislature also passed Assembly Bill 1373 (2023) (“AB 1373”) that requires the CEC to submit a report to the Legislature that assesses whether each local publicly owned electric utility in California (both inside and outside the CAISO) exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin for 2023. The report must also assess whether local publicly owned utilities met the planning reserve margin for June through September 2023 established by the CPUC’s June 2022 decision (i.e., 16%). See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Reliability.”

While SMUD believes the CEC’s report will show SMUD met both its 15% planning reserve margin and the CPUC’s 16% planning reserve margin for 2023, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the report, or what the Legislature intends to do with the report. To the extent the CEC or Legislature imposes a higher POU planning reserve margin for future years that includes SMUD, the ultimate impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy/capacity, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers; however, such impacts could be material.

**Western Energy Imbalance Market and Extended Day Ahead Market**

Federal and state policymakers have long-promoted the development of organized markets in the west as a means (among other reasons) to better integrate intermittent renewable resources into the electric system, the first of which markets is the Western EIM, operated by the CAISO. The CAISO successfully launched the WEIM, a real time only imbalance market, on October 1, 2014, with PacifiCorp as the first participant. Since this time, the WEIM has grown significantly with the addition of 21 other Balancing

A-75
<!-- Page 661 -->
![Authority Areas](https://example.com/image.png)

Authority Areas (including BANC) which together comprise roughly 80% of the load in the Western Interconnection.

To date, participation in the WEIM by SMUD has shown significant financial and operational benefits, in addition to furthering an already favorable working partnership between SMUD and the CAISO to develop solutions to integrate renewable resources in support of carbon reduction goals.

BANC’s participation not only signaled the first public power participant in the EIM, but was also implemented utilizing a unique phased approach, with SMUD (as the largest member of BANC) implementing so-called WEIM Phase 1 in 2019, while the other BANC members and WAPA (the “Phase 2 Parties”) joined after further evaluation and approvals in March of 2021.

Part of the BANC Phase 2 participation included reimbursement to SMUD certain upfront infrastructure costs incurred by SMUD in Phase 1 to establish BANC as an WEIM Entity. This reimbursement to SMUD by the Phase 2 Parties has been completed.

The CAISO and WEIM participants, including SMUD and BANC, have participated in developing a design framework to extend the successful WEIM real time framework to the EDAM. Like WEIM, EDAM would broaden the access to regional resources for the reliable integration of renewable resources, only over a longer (day ahead) time horizon by allowing for a more economic and efficient optimization of regional resources by providing grid operators greater time (day ahead as opposed to real time) to commit or decommit units based on market price signals. Only participants in the WEIM will be allowed to extend their participation to EDAM. The CAISO launched a public stakeholder initiative and utilized most of 2022 developing the EDAM design. On February 1, 2023 the CAISO Board of Governors and EIM Governing Body approved the EDAM proposal, with the CAISO filing and amendments with FERC on August 22, 2023. FERC unanimously approved most of the filing on December 20, 2023, rejecting without prejudice just one element of the EDAM proposal related to transmission revenue recovery for market participants. The CAISO will work with first movers, PacifiCorp and BANC, and stakeholders in 2024 to refine transmission revenue recovery based on FERC’s guidance and begin implementation activities, with the market expected to go-live in the first quarter of 2026. Similar to the process around WEIM participation, SMUD, along with BANC, performed cost-benefit studies that demonstrated EDAM participation will expand on the existing WEIM benefits and in August 2023, SMUD and BANC both approved participation in EDAM with an expectation to on-board in time for the first phase of EDAM participation in 2026.

Other Factors

The electric utility industry in general has been, or in the future may be, affected by a number of other factors which could impact the financial condition and competitiveness of many electric utilities and the level of utilization of generating and transmission facilities. In addition to the factors discussed above, such factors include, among others, (a) effects of compliance with rapidly changing environmental, safety, licensing, regulatory and legislative requirements other than those described above; (b) changes resulting from conservation and demand side management programs on the timing and use of electric energy; (c) effects of competition from traditional energy policy; (d) effects of competition from other electric utilities (including increased competition resulting from mergers, acquisitions, and “strategic alliances” of competing electric and natural gas utilities and from competitors transmitting less expensive electricity from much greater distances over an interconnected system) and new methods of, and new facilities for, producing low cost electricity; (e) the repeal of certain federal statutes that would have the effect of increasing the competitiveness of many IOUs; (f) increased competition from independent power producers and marketers, brokers and federal power marketing agencies; (g) “self-generation” or “distributed generation” (such as solar, microturbines and fuel cells) by industrial and commercial customers and others; (h) issues relating to the ability to issue tax exempt obligations, including severe restrictions on the ability

to sell to nongovernmental entities electricity from generation projects and transmission service from transmission line projects financed with tax exempt obligations; (i) effects of inflation on the operating and maintenance costs of an electric utility and its facilities; (j) changes from projected future load requirements; (k) increases in costs and uncertain availability of capital; (l) issues relating to supply chains and the uncertain availability or increased costs of necessary materials; (m) shifts in the availability and relative costs of different fuels (including the cost of natural gas); (n) sudden and dramatic increases in the price of energy purchased on the open market that may occur at times of high peak demand in an area of the country experiencing such high peak demand, such as has occurred in the State; (o) issues relating to risk management procedures and practices with respect to, among other things, the purchase and sale of natural gas, energy and transmission capacity; (p) other legislative changes, voter initiatives, referenda and statewide propositions; (q) effects of changes in the economy; (r) effects of possible manipulation of the electric markets; (s) natural disasters or other physical calamities, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, droughts, severe weather, wildfires and floods; (t) changes to the climate, including increasing volatility in rainfall in the Western United States and a reduction in the depth and duration of the Sierra snowpack; (u) issues relating to cyber-security; and (v) outbreaks of infectious diseases or the occurrence of pandemics. Any of these factors (as well as other factors) could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of any given electric utility, including SMUD’s electric utility, and likely will affect individual utilities in different ways.

SMUD is unable to predict what impact such factors will have on the business operations and financial condition of SMUD’s electric system, but the impact could be significant. SMUD has taken major steps to mitigate the impacts of many of the changes. This Official Statement includes a brief discussion of certain of these factors. This discussion does not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and matters are subject to change subsequent to the date hereof. Extensive information on the electric utility industry is available from the legislative and regulatory sources and other sources in the public domain, and potential purchasers of any of SMUD’s Senior Bonds or Subordinated Bonds described in the forepart of this Official Statement should obtain and review such information.

## BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

The information in this Appendix regarding DTC has been provided by DTC, and SMUD takes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness thereof. SMUD cannot and does not give any assurances that DTC, DTC Participants or Indirect Participants will distribute the Beneficial Owners either (a) payments of interest or principal with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds or (b) certificates representing ownership interest in or other confirmation of ownership interest in the 2024 Series N Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis or that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this Official Statement.

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the 2024 Series N Bonds. The 2024 Series N Bonds will be issued as fully registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.

DTC, the world’s largest depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. DTC holds and accepts servicing for over 3.5 instruments from over 100 countries that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others, such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.

Purchases of the 2024 Series N Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the 2024 Series N Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each 2024 Series N Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their beneficial ownership interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the 2024 Series N Bonds is discontinued.

1
<!-- Page 665 -->
To facilitate subsequent transfers, all 2024 Series N Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of the 2024 Series N Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such 2024 Series N Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the bond documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the 2024 Series N Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners.

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of a maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in the 2024 Series N Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed.

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to SMUD as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the 2024 Series N Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).

Principal, premium, redemption proceeds and interest payments on the 2024 Series N Bonds will be made to Cede & Co. or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts, upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from SMUD or the Trustee, on a

# APPENDIX D

## SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Resolution. Other provisions of the Resolution are described under the captions “THE 2024 SERIES N BONDS” and “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS.” This summary is not to be considered a full statement of the terms of the Resolution and accordingly is qualified by reference thereto and is subject to the full text thereof. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Official Statement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

Between July 1997 and August 2003, SMUD received consents to amend the Resolution from the owners of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Bonds. Pursuant to the authority granted by such consents, SMUD amended the Resolution in October 2003 by adopting the Forty-Eighth Supplemental Resolution. The following summary of the Resolution reflects such amendments.

The purchasers of the 2024 Series N Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series N Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution (the “Proposed Amendments”). Such amendments are described in **bold italic** font in the forepart of this Official Statement under “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Rates and Charges” and “– Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues” and in this summary of the Resolution under the captions “Certain Definitions” and “Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds.” The written consents to the Proposed Amendments of the holders and registered owners of at least 60% of the Bonds outstanding have been filed with SMUD or the Trustee, as required by the Resolution. However, while certain Bonds remain outstanding SMUD must also obtain the written consents of the holders and registered owners of the Proposed Amendments. SMUD expects to implement the Proposed Amendments when the written consents of such bond insurers are obtained or when the Bonds insured by such bond insurers are no longer outstanding. The final maturity date of the insured Bonds is July 1, 2024.

### Certain Definitions

“Assumed Interest Payments” means for any fiscal year or period interest which would accrue during such fiscal year or period on an amount equal to the then unamortized balance of the remaining sum of Assumed Principal Payments at the Assumed Interest Rate.

“Assumed Interest Rate” for any Parity Bond means an interest rate equal to the “Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index” most recently published in The Bond Buyer prior to the date of issuance of the Parity Bond to which the Assumed Interest Rate is applicable.

“Assumed Principal Payments” means for any fiscal year or period the sum of all amortized portions of each Excluded Principal Payment which fall within such fiscal year or period after the Excluded Principal Payments have been amortized (for purposes of this definition) equally over the years (pro rata in the case of a partial year) in the period commencing on the date of issuance of the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payment relates and ending on the date which is 30 years from such date of issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parity Bonds determined by SMUD to be an Excluded Principal Payment are refinanced with Parity Bonds determined by SMUD to be another Excluded Principal Payment, (1) Assumed Principal Payments with respect to the refinancing Parity Bonds shall not include any amount of principal which has previously been assumed amortized with respect to the refinanced Parity Bonds and (2) the period over which the refinancing Parity Bonds shall be assumed to be amortized shall be the period commencing on the date of issuance of the refinancing Parity Bonds and ending on the date which is 30 years from the date of issuance of the refinanced Parity Bonds.
<!-- Page 668 -->
**“Electric System”** means the entire electric system of SMUD, together with all additions, betterments, extensions and improvements.

**“Energy Payments”** means, when used with respect to the Electric System, all actual costs incurred, or charges made therefor, by SMUD in any particular fiscal year or period to which said term is applicable for purchased power (including power purchased from any special district included within the boundaries of SMUD), electric and thermal energy and capacity under contracts providing for payments by SMUD for electric or thermal energy or capacity whether or not such energy or capacity is delivered or capable of being delivered or otherwise made available to or received by or for the account of SMUD.

**“Excluded Principal Payments”** means each payment of principal on Parity Bonds which the Board of Directors of SMUD determines (on a date not later than the date of issuance of such Parity Bonds) that SMUD intends to refinance at or prior to the maturity date(s) of such Parity Bonds or otherwise to pay with moneys which are not Revenues. No such determination shall affect the security for such Parity Bonds or the obligation of SMUD to pay such payments from Revenues.

**“Financial Products Agreement”** means an interest rate swap, cap, collar, option, floor, forward or other hedging agreement, arrangement or security, however denominated, entered into by SMUD with a Qualified Provider not for investment purposes but with respect to specific Parity Bonds for the purpose of (1) reducing or otherwise managing SMUD’s risk of interest rate changes or (2) effectively converting SMUD’s interest rate exposure, in whole or in part, from a fixed rate exposure to a variable rate exposure, or from a variable rate exposure to a fixed rate exposure.

**“Financial Product Payments”** means payments periodically required to be paid to a counterparty by SMUD pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement.

**“Financial Product Receipts”** means amounts periodically required to be paid to SMUD by a counterparty pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement.

**“Maintenance and Operation Costs”** means all actual maintenance and operation costs incurred by SMUD (including purchased power and fuel costs) or charges therefor made in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, exclusive in all cases of depreciation, or obsolescence charges or reserves therefor, amortization of intangibles or other entries of a similar nature, interest charges and charges for the payment of principal of SMUD debt.

**“Net Revenues”** for any fiscal period means the sum of (a) the Revenues for such fiscal period plus (b) the amounts, if any, withdrawn by SMUD from the Rate Stabilization Fund for treatment as Revenues for such fiscal period, less the sum of (c) all Maintenance and Operation Costs for such fiscal period, (d) all Energy Payments for such fiscal period not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs for such fiscal period, and (e) the amounts, if any, withdrawn by SMUD from Revenues for such fiscal period for deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund pursuant to the Resolution.

**“Parity Bonds”** includes the Bonds and all revenue bonds issued on a parity with the Bonds as provided or permitted in the Resolution. No Parity Bonds (other than the Bonds) are currently outstanding.

**“Qualified Provider”** means any financial institution or insurance company which is a party to a Financial Products Agreement if the unsecured long-term debt obligations of such financial institution or insurance company (or of the parent or a subsidiary of such financial institution or insurance company if such parent or subsidiary unconditionally guarantees the performance of such financial institution or insurance company under such Financial Products Agreement and the Trustee receives an opinion of
<!-- Page 669 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Rate Stabilization Fund** means the fund by that name established in the Resolution. From time to time, after provision for debt service, SMUD may deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund from remaining Revenues such amounts as SMUD shall determine, provided that deposits may be made until (but not after) the date 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. SMUD may withdraw amounts from the Rate Stabilization Fund only for inclusion in Revenues for any fiscal year, such withdrawals to be made until (but not after) 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. All interest or other earnings on deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be withdrawn therefrom and accounted for as Revenues. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no deposit of Revenues to the Rate Stabilization Fund may be made to the extent such Revenues were included in an engineer’s certificate submitted in connection with the issuance of additional revenue bonds payable from Revenues and withdrawal of the Revenues to be deposited in the Rate Stabilization Fund from the Revenues employed in rendering said engineer’s certificate would have caused noncompliance with the provisions of the Resolution restricting issuance of additional obligations or securities payable from Revenues or to the extent any withdrawal of amounts from remaining Revenues for the Rate Stabilization Fund for any fiscal year would have reduced the debt service ratio referred to in this Appendix under the caption “Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds” to or below 1.40.

**Revenues** means all revenues derived by SMUD from the operation of the Electric System, or arising from the Electric System (consisting primarily of income derived from the sale or use of electric energy generated, transmitted or distributed by the Electric System, but also including receipts from the sale of property pertaining to the Electric System or incidental to the operation of the Electric System or from services performed by SMUD in connection with the Electric System and revenues derived from certain wholesale, but not retail, sales of water), but exclusive in every case of any moneys derived from the levy or collection of taxes upon any taxable property in SMUD.

**Subsidy** means any subsidy, reimbursement or other payment from the federal government of the United States of America under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (or any similar legislation or regulation of the federal government of the United States of America or any other governmental entity or extension of any such legislation or regulation).

**Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds**

The Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund (the “Reserve Fund”) is created under the Resolution. The Reserve Fund secures all Bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 that are currently outstanding (and not otherwise deemed to be paid and discharged under the Resolution) and may secure additional Bonds issued in the future. However, the Reserve Fund does not secure and will not be available to pay debt service on the 2024 Series N Bonds.

After the close of each fiscal year, SMUD shall determine the ratio (herein called the “debt service ratio”) of (1) the Net Revenues during said fiscal year to (2) the maximum annual debt service during the period of three fiscal years next following said fiscal year on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding. For this purpose, the term “maximum annual debt service” shall mean the sum of (i) the interest falling due on serial bonds and term bonds, (ii) the principal amount of serial bonds falling due by
<!-- Page 670 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

their terms, and (iii) the amount of minimum sinking fund payments required, as computed for the year in which such sum shall be a maximum. Interest during construction which has been funded and provided for shall not be included in "minimum annual debt service" for the purpose of the above calculation.

So long as the debt service ratio shall exceed 1.40, the amount required to be maintained in the Reserve Fund shall be an amount such that the amount in the combined reserve funds of all Parity Bonds then outstanding will at no time be less than the current annual interest requirements on all then outstanding Parity Bonds, except any bonds (if any) for which payment has been provided in advance. If the debt service ratio in any fiscal year shall fall below 1.40, the Treasurer shall set aside in the Reserve Fund or in any other reserve fund or funds established for any one or more issues of the Parity Bonds (on or before the first day of each month of the next succeeding fiscal year) from the first available Net Revenues an amount not less than 15% of the sum of the current monthly interest requirements of all Parity Bonds then outstanding until the next year in which the debt service ratio shall exceed 1.40 or until the aggregate amount in the combined reserve funds established for all of the Parity Bonds (including the Reserve Fund) is equal to the maximum annual debt service on all of the Parity Bonds then outstanding, whichever shall first occur.

For purposes of the above calculation, the interest rates of Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such interest rate or rates for such period or periods, and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period covered by such known period or periods, the interest rate shall be the greater of the numerical maximum rate that such Bonds may vary or be adjusted to and the numerical maximum rate (if any) that the interest rate for such Bonds may be fixed to, in both cases as set forth in the supplemental resolution authorizing such Bonds, or if such rate or rates have been increased in accordance with such supplemental resolution at such increased rate or rates.

Any amount in the Reserve Fund at any time in excess of the balance required to be then maintained therein shall be released to SMUD for any SMUD use.

SMUD shall not be required, notwithstanding anything herein contained, to maintain in the combined reserve funds appertaining to all Parity Bonds of SMUD, an aggregate amount in excess of the maximum annual debt service requirements in any subsequent fiscal year on all of the then outstanding Parity Bonds.

Any moneys at any time in any of said reserve funds shall be held by the Treasurer in trust for the benefit of the holder or holders from time to time of the Bonds and the coupons appertaining thereto entitled to be paid therewith, and SMUD shall not have any beneficial right or interest in any such moneys.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Supplemental Resolution adopted after the Forty-Eighth Supplemental Resolution may provide that a Series of Bonds issued pursuant to such Supplemental Resolution shall not be secured by the Reserve Fund. In such event, (i) payments of the principal of and interest on such Bonds shall be excluded from all calculations made in respect of the amount to be maintained in the Reserve Fund and (ii) amounts on deposit in the Reserve Fund shall not be applied to the payment of the principal of or interest on such Bonds, even if no other moneys are available therefor.

any expiration or termination thereof; provided, however, that no such drawing need be made if other moneys or a letter of credit are available in the Reserve Fund in the amount of the Reserve Fund Requirement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the prior two paragraphs, if at any time that there is on deposit in the Reserve Fund a combination of cash, a letter of credit and/or a surety bond as contemplated above, SMUD shall draw first on such cash to the extent required and available, then on (1) such surety bond and letter of credit on a pro rata basis (if both a surety bond and letter of credit are available) to the extent required and available, or (2) such surety bond or letter of credit (if either a surety bond or letter of credit, but not both, is available) to the extent required and available.

For purposes of calculating the “debt service ratio” and, unless otherwise specified in a Supplemental Resolution providing for the issuance of a series of Parity Bonds, the amount required to be maintained in the Reserve Fund as described above: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Net Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

### Additional Covenants

The Resolution contains the following additional covenants, among others:

1. That the Electric System will be maintained in good repair, working order and condition at all times, and will be continuously operated in an efficient and economical manner.

2. That no electric energy shall be supplied free by SMUD, and a reasonable wholesale charge will be made for water distributed at any cost to SMUD and such charge will be deemed Revenues; but SMUD may supply without charge water furnished to it without distribution cost, and any moneys received from any retail sales of water will not be deemed Revenues.

3. That all taxes and governmental charges and other lawful claims which might become a lien on the Electric System or the Revenues or impair the security of the Bonds will be paid and discharged when due.

4. That SMUD will comply with all lawful orders of any governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction in the premises (except while the validity or application thereof is being contested in good faith) and with all necessary permits and licenses issued by the NRC.

5. That no lease or agreement will be entered into, or sale or other disposition of essential property made, that would impair the operation of the Electric System or the rights of Bondholders with respect to the Revenues; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Master Resolution, SMUD may sell or otherwise dispose of its accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD provided that SMUD delivers to the Trustee:

   (a) a Certificate of SMUD to the effect that the amount derived by SMUD from the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances is a result of the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances upon fair and reasonable terms no
<!-- Page 673 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

less favorable to SMUD than the terms of a comparable arm’s-length transaction treated as a sale and not a loan under generally accepted accounting principles; and  
(b) a written statement or report of an independent certified public accountant to the effect that, based on the audited financial statements of SMUD for the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available and after giving effect to such transaction by reducing Revenues for such fiscal year by the difference between the face amount of such accounts receivable or loan balances and the amount derived by SMUD from the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances, the debt service ratio computed pursuant to the Master Resolution would not have been reduced to less than 1.40:1.0.

6. That proper records and accounts will be maintained of all transactions relating to the Electric System and the Revenues (open to inspection by the Trustee and the holders of not less than 10 percent in principal amount of the Bonds), to be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant within 90 days after close of the fiscal year, and copies of such financial statements supplied to Bondholders on request.

7. That insurance adequate in amounts and as to risks covered will be maintained against such risks as are usually insurable in connection with similar electric systems, and in addition public liability and property damage insurance in amounts not less than $1,000,000 per accident and adequate fidelity bonds on all officers and employees of SMUD handling or responsible for SMUD funds, subject in each case to the condition that such insurance is obtainable at reasonable rates and upon reasonable terms and conditions. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – INSURANCE” attached to this Official Statement for a description of such insurance.

8. That the net proceeds realized by SMUD in the event all or any part of the Electric System is taken by eminent domain proceedings will be applied to the redemption or retirement of all Bonds and Parity Bonds if sufficient therefor, and, if not, then pro rata to the redemption or retirement of Bonds and Parity Bonds or to new facilities if the additional Revenues to be derived therefrom will sufficiently offset the loss of Revenues resulting from such eminent domain so that the ability of SMUD to meet its obligations will not be substantially impaired.

9. That SMUD will at all times use its best efforts to maintain the powers, functions and duties now reposed in it pursuant to law.

10. That SMUD will establish and at all times maintain and collect rates and charges for the sale or use of its electric energy sufficient to permit SMUD to purchase power or issue and sell Bonds or Parity Bonds to finance additions, betterments, extensions and improvements to the Electric System as may be reasonably necessary to satisfy its then projected electric demand upon its Electric System, and that unless the Board determines that SMUD will be able to satisfy such demand through the purchase of electric energy, SMUD will proceed with all reasonable diligence to issue and sell such Bonds or Parity Bonds.

11. That SMUD will not create, or permit the creation of, any mortgage or lien upon the Electric System or any property essential to the proper operation of the Electric System or to the maintenance of the Revenues. SMUD will not create, or permit the creation of, any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon the Revenues except as provided in the Master Resolution; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Master Resolution, SMUD may create a pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon its accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD (which pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance shall be prior to any pledge, lien, charge or
<!-- Page 674 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

encumbrance created or made pursuant to the Master Resolution, including without limitation the pledge of Revenues made pursuant to the Master Resolution) to secure indebtedness with a term of one year or less provided that the principal amount of such indebtedness does not exceed 50% of the aggregate face amount of the accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD as shown on SMUD’s most recent audited financial statements.

## Amendment of the Resolution

The Resolution and the rights and obligations of SMUD and of the holders of the Bonds may be modified or amended at any time pursuant to the affirmative vote at a meeting of Bondholders, or with the written consent without a meeting, of the holders of 60 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding, provided that no such modification or amendment shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Bond, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Bond so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Bonds required for consent to an amendment or modification, without the consent of the holders of all the Bonds then outstanding. Modifications or amendments may be made, without the consent of any Bondholders, to add covenants of SMUD or to surrender rights reserved by SMUD in the Resolution, to cure ambiguities or defective or inconsistent provisions or in regard to questions arising under the Resolution without adversely affecting the interests of the Bondholders, or to provide for the issuance of a series of Bonds, subject to the provisions contained in the Resolution with respect thereto.

## Events of Default and Remedies of Bondholders

The Resolution declares each of the following to be an event of default:

(a) Failure to pay the principal of and premium on any Bond when due and payable;

(b) Failure to pay any installment of interest on any Bond when due and payable, if such default continues for a period of 30 days;

(c) Default by SMUD in the observance of any of the covenants, agreements or conditions on its part in the Resolution or in the Bonds, if such default continues for a period of 60 days after written notice thereof (specifying such default and requiring the same to be remedied) has been given to SMUD by the Trustee, or to SMUD and the Trustee by the holders of not less than 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time outstanding; and

(d) If, under the provisions of any law for the relief or aid of debtors, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume custody or control of SMUD or of the whole or any substantial part of its property, and such custody or control shall not be terminated or stayed within 60 days;

In the event of default, the Trustee or the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Bonds may, upon written notice to SMUD, declare the principal of all outstanding Bonds, and the interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately. The Trustee is appointed as trustee to represent Bondholders and may take such action as may seem appropriate to it, and, upon the written request of the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Bonds, and upon being furnished with indemnity satisfactory to it, will take such action on behalf of Bondholders as is specified in such written request. Each Bondholder is entitled to proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in such holder by the Resolution by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such holder deems most effectual.
<!-- Page 675 -->
![Page 9](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+9)

The rights of Bondholders are limited and restricted to the use and application of Revenues as provided in the Resolution and do not extend to the levy of any attachment or execution upon or forfeiture of any of the properties of SMUD or to any moneys derived by SMUD from the levy or collection of taxes.

In addition to the limitations on remedies contained in the Resolution, the rights and remedies provided by the Bonds and the Resolution, as well as the enforcement by SMUD of contracts with customers of the Electric System, may be limited by and are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

### Refunding of 2024 Series N Bonds
If Refunding Bonds are issued for the purpose of refunding 2024 Series N Bonds, then SMUD is authorized to apply proceeds of the sale of such Refunding Bonds to the payment of the purchase price of direct noncallable obligations of the United States of America (“Treasury Obligations”) to be held by the Trustee to insure the payment or retirement at or before maturity of all or a portion of the outstanding 2024 Series N Bonds. Upon deposit with the Trustee, in trust, of money or Treasury Obligations (including, but not limited to, direct obligations of the United States of America issued in book-entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury of the United States of America), or any combination thereof, sufficient, together with the interest to accrue on any such Treasury Obligations, to pay or redeem all or a portion of 2024 Series N Bonds then outstanding at or before their maturity date, all liability of SMUD in respect of such 2024 Series N Bonds shall cease, determine and be completely discharged, and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to payment by SMUD of the money and Treasury Obligations deposited with the Trustee for their payment. If the liability of SMUD shall cease and determine with respect to all or a portion of the 2024 Series N Bonds, then said 2024 Series N Bonds shall not be considered to be outstanding Bonds for any purpose of the Resolution.

### Discharge of Resolution
The Resolution may be discharged by depositing with the Trustee in trust, moneys or Federal Securities or general obligation bonds of the State of California, in such amount as the Trustee shall determine will, together with the interest to accrue thereon, be fully sufficient to pay and discharge the indebtedness on all Bonds at or before their respective maturity dates.

### Investment of Funds
Moneys in any fund established by the Resolution may be invested in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, bills, bankers acceptances or other securities in which funds of SMUD may be legally invested as provided by the law in effect at the time of such investment. Currently this investment authority includes, among other things, the Local Agency Investment Fund which is administered by the Treasurer of the State of California for the investment of funds belonging to local agencies in the State of California.

## PROPOSED FORM OF LEGAL OPINION FOR 2024 SERIES N BONDS

[Closing Date]  
Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Sacramento, California  

Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2024 Series N  
(Final Opinion)  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) in connection with the issuance of $ __________ aggregate principal amount of Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2024 Series N (the “2024 Series N Bonds”), issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 of the Board of Directors of SMUD, adopted January 7, 1971 (the “Master Resolution”), as supplemented and amended by later resolutions of said Board of Directors (as so supplemented and amended, the “Resolution”), including Resolution No. 24-03-[__], adopted March 21, 2024 (the “Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Resolution; the Tax Certificate, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”), executed by SMUD; opinions of counsel to SMUD and the Trustee; certificates of SMUD, the Trustee and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after original delivery of the 2024 Series N Bonds on the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after original delivery of the 2024 Series N Bonds on the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not be, relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters. Our engagement with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds has concluded with their issuance, and we disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures provided to us and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than SMUD. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to in the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes.

or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against governmental entities such as SMUD in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the property described in or as subject to the lien of the Resolution or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein of, or the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such property. Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official Statement, dated ______, 2024, or other offering material relating to the 2024 Series N Bonds and express no opinion or view with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1. The 2024 Series N Bonds constitute the valid and binding obligations of SMUD.

2. The Resolution, including the Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, has been duly adopted by, and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of, SMUD. The Resolution creates a valid pledge, to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds, of the Net Revenues, subject to the provisions of the Resolution permitting the application thereof for the purposes on and the terms and conditions set forth in the Resolution.

3. Interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. We observe that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series N Bonds.

Faithfully yours,

**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his designee to approve the inclusion of SMUD’s disclosure information (Appendix A) in the Preliminary Official Statement pursuant to the commodity prepay transaction with the Northern California Energy Authority (NCEA) as the bond issuer and execute the Commodity Supply Agreement and any other related documents necessary to facilitate this transaction.

**Summary:**  
SMUD entered into a 30 year commodity supply agreement with NCEA in 2018 for an initial 5-year term. NCEA is refinancing and extending the original transaction to a new 6-8 year term which will allow SMUD to save as much as $3 million annually, depending on market conditions at pricing. The commodity supply agreement allows for maximum flexibility where SMUD can receive fuel, electricity, or novate an existing renewable power purchase agreement or novate a supply of biogas. It also provides SMUD the opportunity to switch to from natural gas to one of the other commodity types prior to 2029 if desired.

Approval of SMUD’s disclosure information will allow NCEA to issue the bonds, and the Commodity Supply Agreement will allow SMUD to purchase natural gas or electricity at a discount, with J.Aron (Goldman Sachs) as the gas/electricity supplier.

**Board Policy:**  
SD-2 Competitive Rates, SD-3 Access to Credit Markets  
**Benefits:**  
SMUD expects to purchase gas/electricity from NCEA at rates lower than index prices.  
**Cost/Budgeted:**  
All fees are expected to be paid by the transaction.  
**Alternatives:**  
Forgo the prepay transaction and associated savings.

"Amortized Value" means, with respect to any Series 2024 Bond to be redeemed when a Fixed Rate Period is in effect with respect to such Bond, the principal amount of such Bond multiplied by the price of such Bond expressed as a percentage, calculated by a major market maker in municipal securities, as the quotation agent, selected by the Issuer, based on the industry standard method of calculating bond prices (as such industry standard prevails on the date of delivery of the Bonds), with a delivery date equal to the date of redemption, a maturity date equal to the earlier of (a) the stated maturity date of such Bond or (b) the Fixed Rate Tender Date of such Bond and a yield equal to such Bond’s original reoffering yield, which, in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds and certain dates, produces the amounts for all of the Series 2024 Bonds set forth in Schedule IV.

"Applicable Factor" means (a) with respect to the initial issuance of a Series of Bonds bearing interest at a SOFR Index Rate, the percentage or factor of the SOFR Rate determined by the Underwriter and specified in the Index Rate Determination Certificate for such Series of Bonds, or (b) with respect to a Series of Bonds for which the Interest Rate Period is being converted to a SOFR Index Rate Period (including a change in such Interest Rate Period from one SOFR Index Determination to another SOFR Index Rate Period), the percentage or factor of the SOFR Index determined by the Remarketing Agent and specified in the applicable Index Rate Determination Certificate or Index Rate Continuation Notice, provided in each case that the Issuer delivers to the Trustee a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel addressing the selection of such percentage or factor.

(g) A rating on the Bonds from at least one Rating Agency.

**Section 2.4 Initial Interest Rate Period; Subsequent Interest Rate Periods.** (a) The Series 2024 Bonds shall be initially issued in the Interest Rate Period set forth in Section 2.2(b). Upon the purchase of the Series 2024 Bonds on the Series 2024 Mandatory Purchase Date, the Interest Rate Period for the Series 2024 Bonds may be converted to a Daily Interest Rate Period, a Weekly Interest Rate Period, a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, an Index Rate Period, a Fixed Rate Period or a combination thereof, as provided in this Article II.

(b) In the manner hereinafter provided, the term of each Series of Bonds will be divided into consecutive Interest Rate Periods during each of which such Bonds shall bear interest at the Daily Interest Rate, the Weekly Interest Rate, CP Interest Term Rates, a Fixed Rate or an Index Rate; provided, however, that the Interest Rate Period shall be the same for all Bonds of a Series, and no Bond shall bear interest in excess of the Maximum Rate. The Interest Rate Period for any Series of Bonds (other than the Initial Interest Rate Period for the Series 2024 Bonds) shall be established pursuant to the related Supplemental Indenture.

**Section 2.5 Daily Interest Rate Period.** (a) **Determination of Daily Interest Rates.** During each Daily Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, the Bonds of such Series shall bear interest at the Daily Interest Rate, which shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent on or before 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on each Business Day for such Business Day.

**Section 2.6 Weekly Interest Rate Period.**

(a) **Determination of Weekly Interest Rates.** During each Weekly Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, the Bonds of such Series shall bear interest at a Daily Interest Rate determined by the Remarketing Agent to be the minimum interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series, would enable the Remarketing Agent to sell the Bonds of such Series on that Business Day at a price (without regarding accrued interest) equal to not less than 100% of the principal amount thereof. With respect to any day that is not a Business Day, the Daily Interest Rate for that day shall be the same Daily Interest Rate established for the immediately preceding Business Day. In the event the Remarketing Agent fails to establish a Daily Interest Rate for any Business Day, then the Daily Interest Rate for that Business Day shall be the Daily Interest Rate for the immediately preceding Business Day if the Daily Interest Rate for the immediately preceding Business Day was established by the Remarketing Agent. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(d), in the event that the Daily Interest Rate for the immediately preceding Business Day was not determined by the Remarketing Agent, or in the event that the Daily Interest Rate determined by the Remarketing Agent shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of law, then the Daily Interest Rate shall be deemed to be equal to the SIFMA Index on the Business Day such Daily Interest Rate would otherwise be determined as provided herein for such Daily Interest Rate Period.

(b) **Conversion to Daily Interest Rate Period.** Subject to Section 2.10, at any time the Issuer, in a Written Direction of the Issuer delivered to the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent (if any), may elect that a Series of Bonds shall bear interest at a Daily Interest Rate. Such direction of the Issuer shall specify (i) the proposed effective date of such Conversion to a Daily Interest Rate Period, which shall be (A) a Business Day not earlier than the 30th day following the second Business Day after receipt by the Trustee of the Written Direction of the Issuer, (B) in the case of a Conversion from a Weekly Interest Rate Period, a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, an Index Rate Period or a Fixed Rate Period, the day immediately following the last day of such Interest Rate Period, or (C) in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture; and (ii) the date of delivery for the Bonds to be purchased on the effective date of such Conversion to a Daily Interest Rate Period. In addition, such direction shall be accompanied by a form of notice required by Section 2.5(c) and a letter of Bond Counsel that it expects to be able to give a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the effective date of the Conversion to the Daily Interest Rate Period. During each Daily Interest Rate Period commencing on the date so specified and ending on the day immediately preceding the effective date of the next succeeding Interest Rate Period, the interest rate borne by the applicable Series of Bonds shall be a Daily Interest Rate.

(c) **Notice of Conversion to Daily Interest Rate Period.** The Trustee shall give notice by first class mail of a Conversion to a Daily Interest Rate Period to the Owners of the Bonds not less than 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of such Daily Interest Rate Period. Such notice shall state: (i) that the Interest Rate Period for such Bonds will be converted to a Daily Interest Rate Period unless Bond Counsel shall fail to deliver a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel as to such Conversion on the applicable Conversion Date; (ii) the proposed Conversion Date to the Daily Interest Rate Period; and (iii) that the Bonds are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the proposed Conversion Date and setting forth the applicable Purchase Price and the place of delivery for purchase of such Bonds.

interest at the Weekly Interest Rate, which shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent by no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday of each week during such Weekly Interest Rate Period, or if such day shall not be a Business Day, then on the next succeeding Business Day. The Weekly Interest Rate for each Weekly Interest Rate Period shall be determined on or prior to the first day of such Weekly Interest Rate Period and shall apply to the period commencing on the first day of such Weekly Interest Rate Period and ending on the next succeeding Wednesday (whether or not a Business Day). Thereafter, each Weekly Interest Rate shall apply to the period commencing on Thursday (whether or not a Business Day) and ending on the next succeeding Wednesday (whether or not a Business Day), unless such Weekly Interest Rate Period shall end on a day other than Wednesday, in which event the last Weekly Interest Rate for such Weekly Interest Rate Period shall apply to the period commencing on Thursday (whether or not a Business Day) preceding the last day of such Weekly Interest Rate Period and ending on the last day of such Weekly Interest Rate Period. The Weekly Interest Rate shall be the rate of interest per annum determined by the Remarketing Agent to be the minimum interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series, would enable the Remarketing Agent to sell the Bonds of such Series for not less than 100% of the principal amount thereof. In the event that the Remarketing Agent fails to establish a Weekly Interest Rate for any week, then the Weekly Interest Rate for such week shall be the same as the Weekly Interest Rate for the immediately preceding week if the Weekly Interest Rate for such preceding week was determined by the Remarketing Agent. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(d), in the event that the Weekly Interest Rate for the immediately preceding week was not determined by the Remarketing Agent, or in the event that the Weekly Interest Rate determined by the Remarketing Agent shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of law, then the interest rate for such week shall be equal to the SIFMA Index on the day such Weekly Interest Rate would otherwise be determined as provided herein for such Weekly Interest Rate Period.

(b) Conversion to Weekly Interest Rate Period. Subject to Section 2.10, at any time, the Issuer, in a Written Direction of the Issuer delivered to the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent (if any), may elect that a Series of Bonds shall bear interest at a Weekly Interest Rate. Such direction of the Issuer shall specify (i) the proposed effective date of such Conversion to a Weekly Interest Rate Period, which shall be (A) a Business Day not earlier than the 30th day following the second Business Day after receipt by the Trustee of such Written Direction of the Issuer, (B) in the case of a Conversion from a Daily Interest Rate Period, a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, an Index Rate Period or a Fixed Rate Period, the day immediately following the last day of such Interest Rate Period, or (C) in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture; and (ii) the date of delivery for such Bonds to be purchased on the effective date of such Conversion to a Weekly Interest Rate Period. In addition, such direction shall be accompanied by a form of notice required by Section 2.6(c) and a letter of Bond Counsel that it expects to be able to give a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the effective date of the Conversion to the Weekly Interest Rate Period. During each Weekly Interest Rate Period commencing on a date so specified and ending on the day immediately preceding the effective date of the next succeeding Interest Rate Period, the interest rate borne by the applicable Series of Bonds shall be a Weekly Interest Rate.

(c) Notice of Conversion to Weekly Interest Rate. The Trustee shall give notice by first-class mail of a Conversion to a Weekly Interest Rate Period to the Owners of the Bonds of the applicable Series not less than 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of such Weekly Interest Rate Period. Such notice shall state: (i) that the Interest Rate Period on such Bonds will be converted to a Weekly Interest Rate unless Bond Counsel fails to deliver a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel as to such Conversion on the applicable Conversion Date; (ii) the proposed Conversion Date to the Weekly Interest Rate Period; and (iii) that the Bonds of the applicable Series are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the proposed Conversion Date and setting forth the applicable Purchase Price and the place of delivery for purchase of such Bonds.

Section 2.7 Fixed Rate Period. (a) Determination of Fixed Rate. During and in connection with a Fixed Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, (i) the Issuer may by Written Notice to the Trustee establish one or more Maturity Dates for the Bonds of such Series, and (ii) each maturity of such Bonds shall bear interest at a Fixed Rate. The Fixed Rate shall be determined by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as the case may be, on a Business Day no later than the Issue Date or the Fixed Rate Conversion Date for such Series of Bonds, as applicable. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.7(d), each Fixed Rate shall be the rate of interest per annum determined by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as the case may be, to be the minimum interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series and maturity, would enable the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as the case may be, to sell the Bonds of such Series and a maturity on such date at a price (without regard to accrued interest) equal to the principal amount thereof. If, for any reason, with respect to any Series of Bonds being converted to a Fixed Rate Period, the Fixed Rate for such Fixed Rate Period is not determined by the Remarketing Agent on or prior to the first day of such Fixed Rate Period, then the Interest Rate Period for the Bonds of the applicable Series shall be a Weekly Interest Rate Period and such Weekly Interest Rate Period shall continue until such time as the Interest Rate Period for such Series of Bonds shall have been converted to a Daily Interest Rate Period, a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, a Fixed Rate Period or an Index Rate Period as provided herein.

(b) Conversion to or Continuation of Fixed Rate Period.

(i) Subject to Section 2.10, at any time, the Issuer, in a Written Direction of the Issuer delivered to the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent (if any), may elect that the Bonds of a Series shall bear interest at a Fixed Rate. Such direction of the Issuer (A) shall specify the proposed effective date of the Fixed Rate Period, which date shall be (1) a Business Day not earlier than the 30th following receipt by the Trustee of such Written Direction of the Issuer, (2) the day immediately following the last day of the Interest Rate Period then in effect, or (3) in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture; (B) shall specify the last day of such Fixed Rate Period, which day shall be either the day immediately prior to the Final Maturity Date for the applicable Series of Bonds, or a day which both immediately precedes a Business Day and is at least 181 days after the effective date of Fixed Rate Period; and (C) with respect to any such Fixed Rate Period, may specify redemption prices and periods different than those set forth in this Indenture or the applicable Supplemental Indenture providing for the issuance of

such Series of Bonds, subject to the Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel as provided in Section 2.7(b)(iii).

(ii) The day following the last day of any Fixed Rate Period for a Series of Bonds shall be a Fixed Rate Tender Date for such Bonds.

(iii) The election of the Issuer described in Section 2.7(b)(i) shall be accompanied by a letter or letters of Bond Counsel and/or Special Tax Counsel that it expects to be able to give a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the Fixed Rate Conversion Date and by a form of the notice to be mailed by the Trustee to the Owners of the Bonds of the applicable Series as provided in Section 2.7(c).

(iv) If, by the 29th day prior to the last day of any Fixed Rate Period that ends on a day other than the day immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the applicable Series of Bonds, the Trustee shall not have received Written Notice of the Issuer’s election that, during the next succeeding Interest Rate Period, the Bonds of such Series shall bear interest at a Daily Interest Rate, a Weekly Interest Rate, a Fixed Rate, an Index Rate or CP Interest Term Rates, then the Bonds of the applicable Series shall be purchased on the applicable Mandatory Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.13 and the Bonds shall not be remarketed.

(v) After the Final Fixed Rate Conversion Date for a Series of Bonds, the Bonds of the applicable Series shall no longer be subject to or have the benefit of the provisions of Section 4.11 through Section 4.22.

(c) Notice of Conversion to or Continuation of Fixed Rate. The Trustee shall give notice of a Conversion to a (or the establishment of another) Fixed Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to the Owners of the Bonds of such Series not less than 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of such Fixed Rate Period. Such notice shall state: (i) that the Interest Rate Period for such Bonds shall be converted to, or continue to be, a Fixed Rate Period unless Bond Counsel fails to deliver a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel as to such Conversion on the Fixed Rate Conversion Date; (ii) the proposed Fixed Rate Conversion Date; and (iii) that such Bonds are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the Fixed Rate Conversion Date and setting forth the applicable Purchase Price and the place of delivery for purchase of such Bonds.

(d) Sale at Premium or Discount. As set forth in Section 2.4(a), the Series 2024 Bonds of each maturity have been sold with an initial issue premium. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.7(a), the Fixed Rate for each maturity of any other Series of Bonds as initially issued, or the Fixed Rate for each maturity of any other Series of Bonds upon conversion to a Fixed Rate Period, shall be the rate of interest per annum determined by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, to be the interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series, would enable the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, to sell such Bonds at a price (without regard to accrued interest) which will result in the lowest net interest cost for such Bonds, after taking into account any premium or discount at which such Bonds are sold by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, provided that:

- 37 -

<!-- Page 737 -->
(i) The Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, certifies in writing to the Trustee and the Issuer that the sale of such Bonds at the interest rate and premium or discount specified by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, is expected to result in the lowest net interest cost for such Bonds;

(ii) The Issuer consents in writing to the sale of such Bonds at such premium or discount;

(iii) In the case of a Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to a Fixed Rate Period, or establishment of another Fixed Rate Period for such Bonds, and the sale of such Bonds at a premium, the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, shall transfer the amount of such premium to the Trustee for deposit into such Funds and Accounts as shall be specified in a Written Direction of the Issuer;

(iv) In the case of a Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to a Fixed Rate Period, or establishment of another Fixed Rate Period for such Bonds, on or before the date of determination of the Fixed Rate, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent a letter or letters of Bond Counsel and/or Special Tax Counsel to the effect that it expects to be able to give a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the Fixed Rate Conversion Date; and

(v) In the case of a Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to a Fixed Rate Period, or establishment of another Fixed Rate Period for such Bonds, on or before the Conversion Date, a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel shall have been received by the Trustee and confirmed to the Issuer and the Remarketing Agent.

Section 2.8 Commercial Paper Interest Rate Periods. (a) Determination of CP Interest Terms and CP Interest Term Rates. During each Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, each Bond of such Series shall bear interest during each CP Interest Term for such Bond and the CP Interest Term Rate for such Bond. The CP Interest Term and the CP Interest Term Rate for each Bond need not be the same for any two Bonds of such Series, even if determined on the same date. Each of such CP Interest Terms and CP Interest Term Rates for each Bond shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent no later than the first day of each CP Interest Term. Each CP Interest Term shall be for a period of days within the range or ranges announced as possible CP Interest Terms no later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of each CP Interest Term by the Remarketing Agent. Each CP Interest Term for each Bond of the applicable Series shall be a period of not more than 180 days, determined by the Remarketing Agent to be the period which, together with all other CP Interest Terms for all Bonds of the applicable Series then Outstanding, will result in the lowest overall interest expense on such Bonds over the next succeeding one hundred eighty (180) days. Each CP Interest Term shall end on either a day which immediately precedes a Business Day or on the day immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the applicable Series of Bonds. If, for any reason, a CP Interest Term for any Bond cannot be so determined by the Remarketing Agent, or if the determination of such CP Interest Term is held by a court of law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such CP Interest Term shall be thirty (30) days, but if the last day so determined shall not be a day immediately preceding a Business Day, such CP Interest Term shall end on the first day immediately preceding the
<!-- Page 738 -->
![Document](https://example.com/document-image)  
Business Day next succeeding such last day, or if such last day would be after the day immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the applicable Series of Bonds, shall end on the day immediately preceding such Final Maturity Date. In determining the number of days in each CP Interest Term, the Remarketing Agent shall take into account the following factors: (i) existing short-term, tax-exempt market rates and indices of such short-term rates; (ii) the existing market supply and demand for short-term tax-exempt securities; (iii) existing yield curves for short-term and long-term tax-exempt securities for obligations of credit quality comparable to the Bonds of the applicable Series; (iv) general economic conditions; (v) industry economic and financial conditions that may affect or be relevant to the Bonds of the applicable Series; (vi) the CP Interest Terms of other Bonds of the applicable Series; and (vii) such other facts, circumstances and conditions pertaining to financial markets as the Remarketing Agent, in its sole discretion, shall determine to be relevant.

The CP Interest Term Rate for each CP Interest Term for each Bond in a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period shall be the rate of interest per annum determined by the Remarketing Agent to be the minimum interest rate which, if borne by such Bond, would enable the Remarketing Agent to sell such Bond on the effective date of such rate at a price equal to the principal amount thereof. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(d), if, for any reason, a CP Interest Term Rate for any Bond in a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period is not so established by the Remarketing Agent for any CP Interest Term, or if such CP Interest Term Rate is determined by a court of law to be invalid or unenforceable, then the CP Interest Term Rate for such CP Interest Term shall be a rate per annum equal to the SIFMA Index on the first day of such CP Interest Term.

(b) Conversion to Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period. Subject to Section 2.10, at any time, the Issuer, in a Written Direction of the Issuer to the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent (if any), may elect that a Series of Bonds shall bear interest at CP Interest Term Rates. Such Written Direction of the Issuer shall specify (i) the proposed effective date of the Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, which shall be (A) a Business Day not earlier than the thirtieth (30th) day following the second Business Day after receipt by the Trustee of such direction, (B) the day immediately following the last day of the Interest Rate Period then in effect, or (C) in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture; and (ii) the date of delivery of such Bonds to be purchased. In addition, the Written Direction of the Issuer shall be accompanied by (i) a letter of Bond Counsel that it expects to be able to give a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the Conversion Date, and (ii) a form of the notice to be mailed by the Trustee to the Owners of the Bonds of the applicable Series as provided in Section 2.8(c). During each Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period commencing on the date so specified and ending on the day immediately preceding the effective date of the next succeeding Interest Rate Period, each Bond of such Series shall bear interest at a CP Interest Term Rate applicable to the CP Interest Term then in effect for such Bond.

(c) Notice of Conversion to CP Interest Term Rates. The Trustee shall give notice by first-class mail of a Conversion to a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period to the Owners of the Bonds of the applicable Series not less than 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of such Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period.

Bond Counsel as to such Conversion on the Conversion Date or other conditions precedent to such adjustment are not met; (ii) the proposed Conversion Date; and (iii) that such Bonds are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on such proposed Conversion Date, regardless of whether any or all conditions precedent to such Conversion are met, and setting forth the applicable Purchase Price and the place of delivery for purchase of such Bonds.

In connection with any such election, and notwithstanding any provision contained in this Section 2.8 to the contrary, each CP Interest Term established by the Remarketing Agent for the Bonds shall end on the same date in order to facilitate the Conversion of such Bonds. The date on which all CP Interest Terms determined for the Bonds end shall be the last day of the then-current Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period and the day next succeeding such date shall be the effective date of the Daily Interest Rate Period, Weekly Interest Rate Period, Fixed Rate Period or Index Rate Period elected by the Issuer for such Bonds.

**Section 2.9 Index Rate Periods.** (a) **Determination of Applicable Spread.** In connection with the issuance of a Series of Bonds bearing interest at an Index Rate, or the Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to an Index Rate, the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, shall determine the Applicable Spread and, if applicable, the Applicable Factor, and shall specify the same in the Index Rate Determination Certificate for the applicable Index Rate Period. The Applicable Spread and any Applicable Factor for an Index Rate Period shall be such amount or percentage as shall result in the minimum interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series as of the first day of the applicable Index Rate Period, under Prevailing Market Conditions, would enable the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, to sell the Bonds at a price equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate principal amount of such Bonds on the first day of the applicable Index Rate Period.

(b) **Determination of Index Rate.**

(i) During any Index Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, such Bonds shall bear interest at an Index Rate, as specified in the applicable Index Rate Determination Certificate delivered to the Trustee on or before the first day of such Interest Rate Period.

(ii) With respect to each SIFMA Index Rate Period, the Calculation Agent shall (A) determine the SIFMA Index by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on each Wednesday or, if such Wednesday is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately succeeding such Wednesday, and (B) determine the SIFMA Index Rate at or before 12:00 noon, New York City time, on each Index Rate Reset Date. The Calculation Agent shall furnish each SIFMA Index Rate so determined to the Issuer and the Trustee by Electronic Means not later than each Index Rate Reset Date.

(iii) With respect to each SOFR Index Rate Period, the Calculation Agent shall (A) determine and provide to the Trustee by Electronic Means the SOFR Index by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on each SOFR Publish Date, and (B) determine and provide to the Trustee by Electronic Means the SOFR Index Rate at or before 12:00 noon, New York City time, on each SOFR Effective Date.

(iv) During any Index Rate Period, interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year and actual days elapsed. The Calculation Agent shall calculate and provide by Electronic Means to the Issuer and the Trustee the amount of interest due and payable on each Series of Bonds bearing interest at an Index Rate (A) with respect to a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SIFMA Index Rate, on or prior to each Interest Payment Date, and (B) with respect to a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SOFR Index Rate, on each Interest Payment Date, which in the case of a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SOFR Index Rate shall be the SOFR Interest Calculation Date. The amount of interest due on a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SIFMA Index Rate on any Interest Payment Date shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the calendar month immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. The amount of interest due on a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SOFR Index Rate on any Interest Payment Date shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the SOFR Accrual Period immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. All percentages resulting from any step in the calculation of interest on a Series of Bonds while in an Index Rate Period will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest ten thousandth of a percentage point (i.e., to five decimal places) when rounded upward, and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation of interest on such Bonds while in an Index Rate Period will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).

(v) Upon the written request of any Bondholder, the Trustee shall (A) confirm the applicable Index Rate then in effect, and (B) provide the calculation of, and supporting data for, the amount of interest due on a Series of Bonds bearing interest at an Index Rate on each Interest Payment Date.

(vi) In determining the Index Rate that any Bond shall bear as provided in this Section 2.9, neither the Underwriter nor the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, the Calculation Agent, nor the Trustee shall have any liability to the Issuer or the Holder of such Bond, except for its negligence or willful misconduct.

(vii) If, during any Index Rate Period, the Index or rate used to determine an Index Rate is not reported by the relevant source at the time necessary for determination of such Index Rate or otherwise ceases to be available, the Issuer or its independent financial advisor shall determine a substitute or replacement Index Rate (as applicable), including any Alternative Rate and any Adjustments, and promptly provide the same via Electronic Means to the Trustee and the Calculation Agent, together with the effective date of the substitute or replacement Index Rate.

which substitute or replacement must be consistent with any corresponding substitute or replacement index designated pursuant to the relevant Interest Rate Swap.

(c) Index Rate Continuation.

(i) On any Mandatory Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.13 or in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture, and unless the Issuer has given written notice with respect to the Conversion of the Bonds to an Interest Rate Period other than the Index Rate Period, the Issuer may establish a new Index Rate Period and a new Index Rate for the Bonds with such right to be exercised by delivery of an Index Rate Continuation Notice to the Trustee no less than 30 days prior to the effective date of the new Index Rate Period. The Index Rate Continuation Notice shall be accompanied by a letter or letters of Bond Counsel and/or Special Tax Counsel to the effect that it expects to be able to deliver a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the effective date of the new Index Rate Period.

(ii) Any establishment of a new Index Rate and Index Rate Period for a Series of Bonds pursuant to paragraph (i) above must comply with the following conditions:

(A) the first day of such new Index Rate Period must be a Mandatory Purchase Date for such Bonds pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.13, and such Bonds shall be required to be tendered for purchase on such date;

(B) the first day of such new Index Rate Period must be a Business Day; and

(iii) Upon receipt by the Trustee of an Index Rate Continuation Notice from an Authorized Officer of the Issuer, as soon as practicable, but in any event not less than 10 Business Days prior to the first day of the proposed Index Rate Period, the Issuer (or any Dissemination Agent appointed by the Issuer) shall give notice by first-class mail or by Electronic Means via EMMA to the Holders of the Bonds of the applicable Series, which notice shall state in substance:

(A) that a new Index Rate Period and Index Rate is to be established for such Bonds and the proposed effective date of such new Index Rate Period (which date shall be the Mandatory Purchase Date for such Bonds pursuant to Section 4.13), and that such new Index Rate Period and Index Rate will become effective on such date if the conditions specified in this Section 2.9 are satisfied on or before such date;

(C) the first day of the new Index Rate Period;

(D) that the new Index Rate Period and Index Rate for the Bonds shall not be established unless a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel is delivered to the Trustee on the first day of the new Index Rate Period and no Failed Remarketing has occurred;

(E) the CUSIP numbers or other identification information of the applicable Series; and

(F) that, to the extent that there shall be on deposit with the Trustee on the first day of the new Index Rate Period an amount of money sufficient to pay the Purchase Price thereof, all the Bonds not delivered to the Trustee on or prior to such date shall be deemed to have been properly tendered for purchase and shall cease to constitute or represent a right on behalf of the Holder thereof to payment of principal thereof or interest thereon and shall represent and constitute only the right to payment of the Purchase Price on deposit with the Trustee, without interest accruing thereon after such date.

(d) End of Index Rate Period. In the event the Issuer has not given an Index Rate Continuation Notice or other Written Notice reasonably acceptable to the Trustee with respect to the Conversion of Bonds to an Interest Rate Period other than an Index Rate Period, in either case at the time required by this Indenture, or if the conditions to the effectiveness of a new Index Rate Period and new Index Rate set forth in Section 2.9(c)(ii) are not satisfied, including as a result of the Remarketing Agent’s failure to establish an Index Rate as herein provided, then the Bonds of the applicable Series shall be purchased on the applicable Mandatory Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.13 and the Bonds shall not be remarketed.

Section 2.10 Notice of Conversion. (a) In the event that the Issuer shall elect to convert the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to a Daily Interest Rate Period, a Weekly Interest Rate Period, a Fixed Rate Period, an Index Rate Period or a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period as provided in this Article II, then the Written Direction of the Issuer required to be delivered to the Trustee by the applicable provision of this Article II shall be given by registered or certified mail, or by Electronic Means.

and the Bonds of the applicable Series shall continue to bear interest in the Daily Interest Rate Period, Weekly Interest Rate Period, Fixed Rate Period, Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period or Index Rate Period, as the case may be, as in effect immediately prior to such proposed Conversion (provided, that the period of any such continuing Fixed Rate Period shall be one year). In any event, if notice of a Conversion has been mailed to the Owners as provided in this Article II and the Issuer rescinds its election to make such Conversion, then the Bonds of the applicable Series shall continue to be subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the date which would have been the Conversion Date as provided in Section 4.14.

(c) No Conversion of a Series of Bonds from one Interest Rate Period to another shall take effect under this Indenture unless each of the following conditions, to the extent applicable, shall have been satisfied:

(i) the Trustee shall have received a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to such Conversion;

(iv) in the case of a Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to an Index Rate Period, prior to the Conversion Date the Issuer shall have appointed a Calculation Agent and executed and delivered a Calculation Agent Agreement with respect to such Series of Bonds.

(d) If any condition to the Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds shall not have been satisfied, then the Interest Rate Period shall not be converted and the Bonds of the applicable Series shall continue in the Daily Interest Rate Period, Weekly Interest Rate Period, Fixed Rate Period, or Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, as the case may be, as in effect immediately prior to such proposed Conversion (provided, that the period of any such continuing Fixed Rate Period shall be one year), and the Bonds of such Series shall continue to be subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the date which would have been the effective date of the Conversion as provided in Section 4.14.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Article II to the contrary, in connection with the Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds from a Fixed Rate Period that would require the mandatory tender for purchase of such Bonds at a Purchase Price greater than the principal amount thereof, the Issuer, as a condition to exercising its option to cause a Conversion - 44 -

**Section 2.12 Provisions Regarding the Issuer Commodity Swap.** (a) In connection with the Commodity Project, the Issuer shall enter into the initial Issuer Commodity Swap with the Commodity Swap Counterparty. The following shall apply to the Commodity Swaps:

(iv) If an Issuer Commodity Swap is not otherwise replaced but the Commodity Supplier is obligated under Section 3(d) of a Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement to continue paying Commodity Swap Receipts in the same amount that would have applied under such Issuer Commodity Swap, then such Issuer Commodity Swap will be deemed to be replaced by such obligation under such Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement and such obligation under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement will be treated as the Issuer Commodity Swap thereafter until such terminated Issuer Commodity Swap is otherwise replaced by another Issuer Commodity Swap.

(c) The following shall apply with respect to the termination of the Issuer Commodity Swap:

(i) Upon the occurrence of a Commodity Swap Replacement Event (defined below), the Issuer shall (A) notify the Commodity Supplier of such event pursuant to Section 17.5(b) of the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and (B) in accordance with Section 17.5(c) of the Commodity Purchase Agreement, either (I) replace the affected Issuer Commodity Swap by exercising its right to increase its notional quantities under the Issuer Commodity Swap with another Commodity Swap Counterparty if such a Commodity Swap is in effect and is not subject to termination, and otherwise (II) use its good faith efforts to replace such Issuer Commodity Swap with an alternate Issuer Commodity Swap during the swap replacement period set forth in Section 17.5(d) of the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

### Section 3.2 Legends.
The Bonds may contain or have endorsed thereon such provisions, specifications and descriptive words not inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture as may be necessary or desirable to comply with custom, the rules of any securities exchange or commission or brokerage board, or otherwise, as may be determined by the Issuer prior to the authentication and delivery thereof.

### Section 3.3 Execution and Authentication.
(a) The Issuer and the Trustee agree that the Electronic Signature of a party to this Indenture, including all acknowledgments, authorizations, directions, waivers and consents thereto (or any amendment or supplement thereto) shall be as valid as an original signature of such party and shall be effective to bind such party to this Indenture. The Issuer and the Trustee agree that any Electronically Signed Document (including this Indenture) shall be deemed (i) to be “written” or “be in writing,” (ii) to have been signed, and (iii) to constitute a record established and maintained in the ordinary course of business and an original written record when printed from electronic files.

In case any one or more of the officers who have signed or sealed any of the Bonds shall cease to be such officer before the Bonds so signed and sealed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, such Bonds may, nevertheless, be authenticated and delivered as herein provided, and may be issued as if the Persons who signed or sealed such Bonds had not ceased to hold such offices.

(c) The Bonds shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication, in the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto, executed manually by the Trustee. Only such Bonds as shall bear thereon such certificate of authentication shall be entitled to any right or benefit under this Indenture, and no Bond shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose until such certificate of authentication shall have been duly executed by the Trustee. Such certificate of the Trustee upon any Bond executed on behalf of the Issuer shall be conclusive evidence that the Bond so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered under this Indenture and that the Holder thereof is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

Section 3.4 Exchange, Transfer and Registry. (a) The Bonds shall be registered as transferred only upon the books of the Issuer, which shall be held and controlled by the Bond Registrar and kept for such purposes at the designated corporate trust office of the Bond Registrar, by the registered owner thereof in person or by its attorney duly authorized in writing, upon surrender thereof together with a written instrument of transfer, in form and with guaranty of signature satisfactory to the Bond Registrar duly executed by the registered owner or its duly authorized attorney. The transferor shall also provide, or cause to be provided, to the Trustee all information reasonably required by the Trustee to allow it to comply with any applicable federal, state or local tax reporting obligations, including, without limitation, any cost-basis reporting obligations under Section 6045 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Trustee may rely upon such information provided to it and shall have no responsibility to verify or ensure the accuracy of such information. Upon the registration of transfer of any Bond, the Issuer shall issue in the name of the transferee a new Bond or Bonds of the same Series, aggregate principal amount and maturity as the surrendered Bond.

(b) The registered owner of any Bond or Bonds of one or more denominations shall have the right to exchange such Bond or Bonds for a new Bond or Bonds of any denomination then authorized for such Bond or Bonds of the same Series, aggregate principal amount and maturity of the surrendered Bond or Bonds. Such Bond or Bonds shall be exchanged by the Issuer for a new Bond or Bonds upon the request of the registered owner thereof in person or by its attorney duly authorized in writing, upon surrender of such Bond or Bonds together with a written instrument requesting such exchange, in form and with guaranty of signature satisfactory to the Bond Registrar duly executed by the registered owner or its duly authorized attorney.

(c) The Issuer and each Fiduciary may deem and treat the Person in whose name any Bond shall be registered upon the books of the Issuer maintained by the Bond Registrar as the absolute owner of such Bond, whether such Bond shall be overdue or not, for the purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal and Redemption Price, if any, of and interest on such Bond and for all other purposes, and all such payments so made to any such registered owner or upon its order shall be valid and effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability upon such Bond to the extent of the sum or sums so paid, and neither the Issuer nor any Fiduciary shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

Section 3.5 Regulations with Respect to Exchanges and Registration of Transfers. In all cases in which the privilege of exchanging or registering the transfer of Bonds is exercised, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver Bonds in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture. All Bonds surrendered in any such exchanges or registration of - 49 -

transfer shall forthwith be delivered to the Trustee and cancelled or retained by the Trustee. Prior to every such exchange or registration of transfer of Bonds, whether temporary or definitive, the Issuer or the Bond Registrar may require the Holder to pay an amount sufficient to reimburse it for any tax, fee or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to such exchange or transfer. Unless otherwise provided in a Supplemental Indenture, neither the Issuer nor the Bond Registrar shall be required (a) to register the transfer or exchange of Bonds for the period next preceding any Interest Payment Date for the Bonds, beginning with the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date and ending on such Interest Payment Date, or for the period next preceding any date for the proposed payment of Defaulted Interest with respect to such Bonds beginning with the Special Record Date for the date of such proposed payment and ending on the date of such proposed payment, (b) to register the transfer or exchange of Bonds for a period beginning 15 days before the mailing of any notice of redemption of such Bonds and ending on the day of such mailing, or (c) to register the transfer or exchange of any Bonds called for redemption. Every Person that transfers Bonds shall timely provide or cause to be timely provided to the Trustee all information necessary to allow the Trustee to comply with any applicable tax reporting obligations, including without limitation any cost-basis reporting obligations under Section 6045 of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Trustee may rely on the information provided to it and shall have no responsibility to verify or ensure the accuracy of such information.

If any Bond becomes mutilated or is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver a new Bond of like Series, date of issue, maturity date, principal amount and interest rate per annum as the Bond so mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, provided that (a) in the case of such mutilated Bond, such Bond is first surrendered to the Trustee, (b) in the case of any such lost, stolen or destroyed Bond, there is first furnished evidence of such loss, theft or destruction, in form satisfactory to the Trustee together with indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee while the Bonds are held in a Book-Entry System and to the Trustee and the Issuer at all other times, (c) all other reasonable requirements of the Issuer, set forth in a Written Instrument of the Issuer delivered to the Trustee are complied with, and (d) expenses in connection with such transaction are paid by the Holder. Any Bond surrendered for registration of transfer shall be cancelled. Any such new Bonds issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 in substitution for Bonds alleged to be destroyed, stolen or lost shall constitute original additional contractual obligations on the part of the Issuer, whether or not the Bonds so alleged to be destroyed, stolen or lost be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be equally secured by and entitled to equal and proportionate benefits with all other Bonds issued under this Indenture, in any moneys or securities held by the Issuer or any Fiduciary for the benefit of the Bondholders.

Section 3.7  Temporary Bonds. (a) Until the definitive Bonds are prepared, the Issuer may execute, in the same manner as is provided in Section 3.3, and upon the request of the Issuer, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of definitive Bonds, but subject to the same provisions, limitations and conditions as the definitive Bonds, one or more temporary Bonds substantially of the tenor of the definitive Bonds in lieu of which such temporary Bond or Bonds are issued, and with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate to temporary Bonds. The Issuer at its own expense shall prepare and execute and, upon the surrender of such temporary Bonds for exchange and the cancellation of such surrendered temporary Bonds, the - 50 -

4011B-2

Trustee shall authenticate and, without service charge to the Owner thereof (except a sum sufficient to cover any tax, fee or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto), deliver in exchange therefor, definitive Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount and maturity as the temporary Bonds surrendered. Until so exchanged, the temporary Bonds shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits and security as definitive Bonds authenticated and issued pursuant to this Indenture.

(b) All temporary Bonds surrendered in exchange either for another temporary Bond or Bonds or for a definitive Bond or Bonds shall be forthwith cancelled by the Trustee.

**Section 3.8 Payment of Interest on Bonds; Interest Rights Preserved.** Interest on any Bond which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Bond is registered at the close of business on the date (hereinafter, the “Regular Record Date”) which is the 15th day of the calendar month next preceding such Interest Payment Date.

Any interest on any Bond which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (hereinafter, “Defaulted Interest”) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Person who was the registered owner on the relevant Regular Record Date; and such Defaulted Interest shall be paid by the Issuer to the Persons in whose names the Bonds are registered at the close of business on a date (hereinafter, the “Special Record Date”) for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner: the Issuer shall notify the Bond Registrar in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Bond and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Issuer shall deposit with the Paying Agent an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to and approved in writing by the Paying Agent for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Section 3.8 provided. Thereupon the Bond Registrar shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days or less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Bond Registrar of written notice of the proposed payment. The Bond Registrar shall promptly notify the Issuer of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Bondholder at his address as it appears upon the registry books, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.8, each Bond delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Bond shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Bond.

**Section 3.9 Book Entry System; Appointment of Securities Depository.** All Bonds shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, as Securities Depository, and held in the custody or for the account of the Securities Depository. A single certificate will be issued and delivered to the Securities Depository for each maturity of Bonds, and the Beneficial Owners will not receive physical delivery of Bond certificates except as provided in this Indenture.

long as the Securities Depository shall continue to serve as securities depository for the Bonds as provided herein, all transfers of Beneficial Ownership interests will be made by book-entry only, and no investor or other party purchasing, selling or otherwise transferring Beneficial Ownership of Bonds is to receive, hold or deliver any Bond certificate.

The Issuer may, with written notice to the Trustee but without the consent of any Bondholders, appoint a successor Securities Depository and enter into an agreement with the successor Securities Depository, to establish procedures with respect to a Book-Entry System for the Bonds not inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture. Any successor Securities Depository shall be a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The Issuer and the Trustee may rely conclusively upon (i) a certificate of the Securities Depository as to the identity of the Participants in the Book-Entry System with respect to the Bonds, and (ii) a certificate of any such Participant as to the identity of, and the respective principal amount of the Bonds beneficially owned by the Beneficial Owners.

Whenever, during the term of the Bonds, the Beneficial Ownership of any Series thereof is determined by a book-entry at the Securities Depository, the requirements in this Indenture of holding, delivering or transferring such Bonds shall be deemed modified to require the appropriate Person to meet the requirements of the Securities Depository as to registering or transferring the book-entry to produce the same effect. Any provision hereof permitting or requiring delivery of the Bonds shall, while such Bonds are in such Book-Entry System, be satisfied by the notation on the books of the Securities Depository in accordance with applicable state law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any security (including any transfers between or among Securities Depository Participants or Beneficial Owners) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.

Except as otherwise specifically provided herein with respect to the rights of Participants and Beneficial Owners, when a Book-Entry System is in effect, the Issuer and the Trustee may not treat the Securities Depository (or its nominee) as the sole and exclusive owner of the Bonds registered in its name for the purposes of payment of the principal or purchase price of and interest on such Bonds or portion thereof to be redeemed or purchased, of giving any notice permitted or required to be given to the Bondholders under this Indenture and of voting, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or obligations to the Securities Depository, any Participant, any Beneficial Owner or any other Person which is not shown on the bond register, with respect to (a) the accuracy of any records maintained by the Securities Depository or any Participant; (b) the payment by the Securities Depository or by any Participant of any amount due to any Beneficial Owner in respect of the principal amount or redemption or purchase price of, or interest on, any Bonds; (c) the delivery of any notice by the Securities Depository or any Participant; (d) the selection of the Beneficial Owners to receive payment in the event of any partial redemption of Bonds;

- any of the Bonds; or (e) any other action taken by the Securities Depository or any Participant. The Trustee shall pay all principal or Redemption Price of and interest on the Bonds registered in the name of Cede only to or “upon the order of” the Securities Depository (as that term is used in the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the State and New York), and all such payments shall be valid and effective to fully satisfy and discharge the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the principal, Redemption Price or purchase price of and interest on such Bonds to the extent of the sum or sums so paid.

The Book-Entry System may be discontinued by the Trustee and the Issuer, at the Written Direction and expense of the Issuer, and the Issuer and the Trustee will cause the delivery of Bond certificates to such Beneficial Owners of the Bonds and registered in the names of such Beneficial Owners as shall be specified to the Trustee by the Securities Depository in writing, under the following circumstances:

(a) The Securities Depository determines to discontinue providing its service with respect to any Bonds and no successor Securities Depository is appointed as described above. Such a determination may be made at any time by giving 30 days’ written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law; or

(b) the Issuer determines, with written notice to the Trustee, not to continue the Book-Entry System with a Securities Depository for the Bonds.

In connection with any proposed transfer outside the Book-Entry System of the Securities Depository, the Securities Depository or the Issuer shall provide or cause to be provided to the Trustee all information necessary to allow the Trustee to comply with any applicable tax reporting obligations, including without limitation any cost-basis reporting obligations under Section 6045 of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations thereunder. The Trustee may rely on the information provided to it and shall have no responsibility to verify or ensure the accuracy of such information.

When the Book-Entry System is not in effect, all references herein to the Securities Depository shall be of no further force or effect.

mandatory tender for purchase shall be purchased on the Mandatory Purchase Date unless (i) a Failed Remarketing shall have occurred prior to a Mandatory Purchase Date occurring at the end of any Interest Rate Period, in which case such Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant to Section 4.1 rather than purchased on such Mandatory Purchase Date, or (ii) such Bonds shall have otherwise been redeemed on or prior to, or are not Outstanding as of, such Mandatory Purchase Date; and (c) that in the event that any Owner of a Bond so subject to mandatory tender for purchase shall not surrender such Bond to the Trustee for purchase on such Mandatory Purchase Date, then such Bond shall be deemed to be an Undelivered Bond, and that no interest shall accrue thereon on and after such Mandatory Purchase Date and that the Owner thereof shall have no rights under this Indenture other than to receive payment of the Purchase Price thereof. Any such notice of a mandatory tender of Bonds pursuant to Section 4.12, Section 4.13 or Section 4.14 shall be given no less than 30 days prior to the applicable Mandatory Purchase Date, and in addition, the Trustee shall give a conditional notice of extraordinary redemption pursuant to Section 4.4 no later than the applicable deadlines set forth in that Section to provide for the extraordinary redemption of the Bonds in the event that a Failed Remarketing occurs prior to the Mandatory Purchase Date. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which such conditional notice of extraordinary redemption is required to be given by the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.4, the Issuer shall direct the Trustee to send such conditional redemption notice pursuant to a Written Direction in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, which Written Direction shall include the applicable Redemption Date and method(s) for calculating the Redemption Price, to be followed by notice of the Redemption Price, as provided in Exhibit E.

Section 4.17 Irrevocable Notice Deemed to Be Tender of Bond; Undelivered Bonds. (a) The giving of notice by an Owner of a Bond bearing interest at a Daily Interest Rate or a Weekly Interest Rate pursuant to Section 4.11 shall constitute the irrevocable tender for purchase of each such Bond with respect to which such notice shall have been given, regardless of whether such Bond is delivered to the Trustee for purchase on the relevant Purchase Date as provided in this Article IV.

(b) The Trustee may refuse to accept delivery of any Purchased Bonds for which a proper instrument of transfer, with a satisfactory guaranty of signature, has not been provided; such refusal, however, shall not affect the validity of the purchase of such Bond as herein described.

(b) No Commodity Swap Counterparty shall have any claim upon the amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Account and no Commodity Swap Payments or Extraordinary Expenses shall be made from the Debt Service Reserve Account.

(c) If the Project Participant fails to make a payment when due under the Commodity Supply Contract, the Trustee shall, not later than the next Business Day following such nonpayment, give notice to the Issuer of such default and the amount of the nonpayment. On the last Business Day of the Month, the Trustee shall withdraw from the Debt Service Reserve Account and deposit into the Debt Service Account an amount equal to any deficiency that exists therein as a result of such nonpayment.

(d) If, as a result of any draw on the Debt Service Reserve Account pursuant to Section 5.9(c) above, the amount on deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Account is less than the Debt Service Reserve Requirement then in effect, the Trustee and the Issuer shall take the actions required by Section 7.11(b).

Prior to said transfer, all investments held in the Debt Service Reserve Account shall be liquidated to the extent necessary in order to provide for the timely payment of principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest on the Bonds.

(g) In the event of the defeasance of any Bonds, the Trustee, if the Issuer so directs in writing, may withdraw from the Debt Service Reserve Account a pro rata portion of the amounts accumulated therein applicable to the Bonds being defeased and deposit such amounts with itself as Trustee for the Bonds being defeased to be held for the payment of the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest on the Bonds being defeased; provided that such withdrawal shall not be made unless immediately thereafter the Bonds being defeased shall be deemed to have been paid pursuant to Section 13.1(b).

## Section 5.11 General Fund. 
(a) The Trustee shall apply moneys on deposit in the General Fund in the following amounts and in the following order of priority: first, for deposit into the Debt Service Account, the amount necessary (or all moneys credited to the General Fund if less than the amount necessary) to make up any deficiencies in the deposits to said Account required by Section 5.5(a)(ii); second, for deposit into the Debt Service Reserve Account, the amount necessary to make up any deficiencies in the deposits to such Account pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(iv); third, to the credit of the Commodity Swap Reserve Account, the amount necessary to cause the Minimum Amount to be on deposit therein; fourth, to the payment of (i) any Operating Expenses then due and payable and for which other funds are not available under this Indenture and (ii) any amounts owed by the Issuer under the Commodity Supply Contract with respect to purchases of replacement gas or electricity by the Project Participant; and fifth, to the payment of any amounts then due and payable with respect to Put Receivables or Call Receivables.

(b) Amounts on deposit in the General Fund not required to meet a deficiency or make a deposit as provided in subsection (a) above shall be applied by the Trustee upon the Written Request of the Issuer to the following in the order listed below:

(i) payment of Extraordinary Expenses;

(ii) any fees owed pursuant to any Qualified Investments;

(iii) annual refunds to the Project Participant pursuant to the Commodity Supply Contract;

(iv) the purchase or redemption of Bonds and expenses in connection with the purchase or redemption of such Bonds or any reserves which the Issuer determines shall be required for such purposes;

(v) any other lawful purpose of the Issuer under the Act;

provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 5.10, amounts credited to the General Fund and required by this Indenture to be applied to the purchase or redemption of Bonds shall be applied to such purpose. There is hereby created a Working Capital Account of the General Fund that may be used for any of the purposes contemplated in this Section.

<!-- Page 777 -->
5.11(b) at the Written Request of the Issuer. The Issuer may deposit funds that are not part of the Trust Estate into the Working Capital Account of the General Fund from time to time.

(c) If at any time Bonds of any maturity for which Sinking Fund Installments shall have been established here (i) purchased or redeemed other than pursuant to Section 5.7(d) or (ii) deemed to have been paid pursuant to Section 12.1(b) and, with respect to such Bonds which have been deemed paid, irrevocable written instructions have been given to the Trustee to redeem or purchase the same on or prior to the due date of the Sinking Fund Installment to be credited under this subsection (c), the Issuer may from time to time and at any time by Written Direction to the Trustee specify the portion, if any, of such Bonds so purchased, redeemed or deemed to have been paid and not previously applied as a credit against any Sinking Fund Installment which are to be credited against future Sinking Fund Installments. Such direction shall specify the amounts of such Bonds to be applied as a credit against each Sinking Fund Installment or Installments and the particular Sinking Fund Installment or Installments against which such Bonds are to be applied as a credit; provided, however, that none of such Bonds may be applied as a credit against a Sinking Fund Installment to become due less than 45 days after such notice is delivered to the Trustee. All such Bonds to be applied as a credit shall be surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation on or prior to the due date of the Sinking Fund Installment against which they are being applied as a credit. The portion of any such Sinking Fund Installment remaining after the deduction of any such amounts credited toward the same (or the original amount of any such Sinking Fund Installment if no amounts shall have been credited toward the same) shall constitute the unsatisfied balance of such Sinking Fund Installment for the purpose of calculation of Sinking Fund Installments due on a future date.

Section 5.12 Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund. There shall be established a Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund. There shall be paid into the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund the amounts specified in Section 5(e) of the Commodity Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the case of a Remediation Remarketing (as defined in the Commodity Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement) pursuant to Section 8 of the Commodity Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement, amounts shall be released from the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund upon such remarketing and applied pursuant to a Written Direction of the Issuer as follows: (a) if the proceeds received by the Trustee from the remarketing equal or exceed the Remediation Remarketing Purchase Price, the portion of the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund allocable to such remarketing shall be transferred to the General Fund, and (b) if the proceeds received by the Trustee from the remarketing are less than the Remediation Remarketing Purchase Price, then (x) the portion of the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund allocable to such remarketing shall be used to make a payment to the Commodity Supplier in an amount equal to the excess of such Remediation Remarketing Purchase Price over such proceeds received by the Issuer from the remarketing, and (y) any remaining amounts shall be transferred to the General Fund. For purposes of this Section 5.12, the portion of the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund allocable to a remarketing shall consist of the product of (i) a fraction, the numerator of which is the purchase price of the gas electricity to be remarketed, and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount previously received by the Issuer from any sale of such gas or electricity in a Non-Private Business Sale (as defined in the Commodity Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement) or Private Business Sale (as defined in the Commodity Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement)

that, as of the time of the remarketing, has not been remediated in accordance with Section 8 of the Commodity Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement, multiplied by (ii) the balance of the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund at the time of the remarketing.

**Section 5.13 Assignment Payment Fund.** In connection with the issuance of Refunding Bonds, any Assignment Payment received from the Commodity Supplier shall be deposited into the Assignment Payment Fund to be transferred to the replacement commodity supplier, provided, however, that if the existing Bonds have not been redeemed or defeased on or before the Mandatory Purchase Date, in whole, by the Refunding Bonds, all or a portion of the Assignment Payment shall be transferred to the Redemption Account in Section 5.8, along with the proceeds of the Refunding Bonds, in order to redeem all of the Outstanding Bonds.

**Section 5.14 Purchases of Bonds.** Except as otherwise provided in Section 5.7, any purchase of Bonds (or portions thereof) by or at the direction of the Issuer pursuant to this Indenture may be made with or without tenders of Bonds and at either public or private sale, in such manner as the Issuer may determine.

**ARTICLE VI**

(b) All moneys held under this Indenture by the Trustee, the Issuer or any Depository shall be held in such manner as may then be required by applicable federal or State laws and regulations and applicable state laws and regulations of the state in which such Depository is located, regarding security for, or granting a preference in the case of, the deposit of public or trust funds or, in the absence of such laws and regulations, shall be either (i) continuously or fully insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or (ii) continuously and fully secured, to the extent not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, by lodging with the Trustee, as custodian, as collateral security, Qualified Investments having a market value (exclusive of accrued interest) not less than the amount of such moneys (or portion thereof not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation); provided, however, that, to the extent permitted by law, it shall not be necessary for the Fiduciaries to give security under this subsection (b) for the deposit of any moneys with them held in trust and set aside by them for the payment of the principal or Redemption Price of or interest on any Bonds, or for the Trustee, the Issuer or any Depository to give security for any moneys which shall be represented by obligations or certificates of deposit purchased as an investment of such moneys.

(c) All moneys deposited with the Trustee and each Depository shall be credited to the particular Fund or Account to which such moneys belong and, except as provided with respect to the investment of moneys in Qualified Investments in Section 6.3, the moneys credited to each particular Fund or Account shall be kept separate and apart from, and not commingled with, any moneys credited to any other Fund or Account or any other moneys deposited with the Trustee, the Issuer and each Depository, except as provided in Section 6.3.

If no written investment directions have been delivered to the Trustee for any Fund or Account, moneys shall be held there uninvested by the Trustee.

With respect to any payments to the Revenue Fund from interest earnings on deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Account or the Commodity Swap Reserve Account as provided for under the immediately preceding sentence, any such amounts paid into the Revenue Fund shall be immediately transferred to the Debt Service Account. If no written investment directions have been delivered to the Trustee for any Fund or Account, moneys shall be held there uninvested by the Trustee.

# ARTICLE VII

## PARTICULAR COVENANTS OF the ISSUER

The Issuer covenants and agrees with the Trustee and the Bondholders as follows:

### Section 7.1 Payment of Bonds.
The Issuer shall duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid, but solely from the Trust Estate, the principal or Redemption Price, if any, of every Bond and the interest thereon, at the dates and places and in the manner provided in the Bonds, according to the true intent and meaning thereof.

### Section 7.2 Extension of Payment of Bonds.
The Issuer shall not directly or indirectly extend or assent to the extension of the maturity of any of the Bonds or the time of payment of any claims for interest by the purchase or funding of such Bonds or claims for interest or by any other arrangement, and in case the maturity of any of the Bonds or the time for payment of any such claims for interest shall be extended, such Bonds or claims for interest shall not be entitled, in case of any default under this Indenture, to the benefit of this Indenture or to any payment out of Revenues or Funds established by this Indenture, including the investment income, if any, thereof, pledged under this Indenture or the moneys (except moneys held in trust for the payment of particular Bonds or claims for interest pursuant to this Indenture) held by the Fiduciaries, except subject to the prior payment of the principal of all Bonds Outstanding the maturity of which has not been extended and of such portion of the accrued interest on the Bonds as shall not be represented by such extended claims for interest.

Notwithstanding this grant of agency power, the Issuer shall retain, in the absence of any conflicting action by the Trustee, the right to exercise any rights for which it has appointed the Trustee as its agent in accordance with the foregoing; provided, however, if an Event of Default has occurred, the Trustee shall have the right to notify the Issuer to cease exercising such rights and, upon receipt of such notice with a copy provided to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, and the Commodity Swap Counterparty under the Issuer Commodity Swap, the Trustee shall have exclusive authority to exercise such rights until such time as the Trustee issues a subsequent notice otherwise.

(b) During the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee shall apply all moneys, securities, funds and Revenues received by the Trustee pursuant to this Article VIII as follows and in the following order, provided that (x) moneys held in the Debt Service Account shall not be used for purposes other than payment of the interest and principal or Redemption Price then due on the Bonds and the payment of Interest Rate Swap Payments then due under the Interest Rate Swap in accordance with clause (iii) of this subsection (b) and (y) moneys in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account shall be used first to pay any Commodity Swap Payments then due:

(i) Expenses of Fiduciaries – to the payment of the reasonable fees, charges, expenses and liabilities of the Fiduciaries, including court costs and fees and expenses of their counsel;

(ii) Operating Expenses – to the payment of the amounts required for Operating Expenses and for the payment of such other amounts related to the Commodity Project as are necessary in the judgment of the Trustee to prevent loss of Revenues. For this purpose, the books of record and accounts of the Issuer relating to the Commodity Project shall at all times during regular business hours be subject to the inspection of the Trustee and its representatives and agents during the continuance of such Event of Default; and

(iii) Principal or Redemption Price and Interest – to the payment of the principal and interest then due and unpaid upon the Bonds and the Interest Rate Swap Payments then due under the Interest Rate Swap, without preference or priority of principal over interest, of any Bond over any other Bond, of any payment in respect of such principal or interest over any Interest Rate Swap Payment or of any Interest Rate Swap Payment over any payment in respect of such principal or interest, ratably, according to the amounts due respectively for principal and interest, to the Persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or preference except as to any difference in the respective rates of interest specified in the Bonds and the Interest Rate Swap.

When the Trustee incurs costs or expenses (including legal fees, costs and expenses) or renders services after the occurrence of an Event of Default, such costs and expenses and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, moratorium, reorganization or other debtor relief law.

(b) All rights of action under this Indenture may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Bonds or the production thereof at the trial or other proceedings, and any such suit or proceedings instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its name.

(c) The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, provided that the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee shall be advised by counsel that the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken, or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or be unjustly prejudicial to the Bondholders not parties to such direction.

(d) Upon commencing a suit in equity or upon other commencement of judicial proceedings by the Trustee to enforce any right under this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled

(e) Regardless of the happening of an Event of Default, the Trustee shall have power to, but unless requested in writing by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding and furnished with reasonable security and indemnity, shall be under no obligation to, institute and maintain such suits and proceedings as it may be advised shall be necessary or expedient to prevent any impairment of the security under this Indenture by any acts which may be unlawful or in violation of this Indenture, and such suits and proceedings as the Trustee may be advised shall be necessary or expedient to preserve or protect its interests and the interests of the Bondholders.

Section 8.6 Restriction on Bondholder’s Action. (a) No Holder of any Bond shall have any right to institute any suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity for the enforcement of any provision of this Indenture or the execution of any trust under this Indenture or for any remedy under this Indenture, unless such Holder (i) shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of the happening of an Event of Default, as provided in this Article VIII, and the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding shall have filed a written request with the Trustee, (ii) shall have offered it reasonable opportunity, either to exercise the powers granted in this Indenture or by the Act or by the laws of the State or to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name, and (iii) shall have offered to the Trustee adequate security and indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee shall have refused to comply with such request for a period of 60 days after receipt by it of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders of Bonds shall have any right in any manner whatever by its or their action to affect, disturb or prejudice the pledge created by this Indenture, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner therein provided; and that all proceedings at law or in equity to enforce any provision of this Indenture shall be instituted, had and maintained in the manner provided in this Indenture and for the equal benefit of all Holders of the Outstanding Bonds, subject only to the provisions of Section 7.2.

(b) Nothing in this Indenture or in the Bonds shall affect or impair the obligation of the Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay only from the Trust Estate, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture, at the respective dates of maturity and places therein expressed the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Bonds to the respective Holders thereof, or affect or impair the right of action, which is also absolute and unconditional, of any Holder to enforce such payment of its Bond.

Section 8.7 Remedies Not Exclusive.

of Default shall impair any right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such Event of Default or be an acquiescence therein; and every power and remedy given by this Article VIII to the Trustee or to the Bondholders may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Trustee or by the Bondholders.

(b) Prior to the declaration of maturity of the Bonds as provided in Section 8.1, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding, or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, may on behalf of the Holders of all of the Bonds waive any past default under this Indenture and its consequences, except a default in the payment of interest on or principal of or premium (if any) on any of the Bonds.

expense or liability or to institute or undertake any suit or proceeding under this Indenture or to enter any appearance in or defend any suit in respect thereof, or to advance any of its own moneys, expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability unless properly indemnified against any and all costs and expenses, outlays and counsel fees and other anticipated disbursements, and against all liability except to the extent caused by its own negligence or willful misconduct. Subject to the provisions of subsection (b), no Fiduciary shall be liable in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder except for its own negligence or willful misconduct. To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer shall indemnify the Fiduciaries for, and hold the Fiduciaries harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred by it, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this Indenture or the trusts hereunder or the performance of its duties hereunder, except to the extent determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been primarily caused by its own negligence or willful misconduct. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the permissive rights of any Fiduciary to do things enumerated under this Indenture shall not be construed as duties.

The Trustee shall not be responsible for insuring any property conveyed or collecting any insurance monies, or for the validity of the execution by the Issuer of this Indenture or of any supplements hereto, or instruments of further assurance, or for the sufficiency of the security for the Bonds, or for the investment of monies as herein permitted (except that no investment shall be made except in compliance with Section 6.2 and Section 6.3 hereof), or for the recording or re-recording, filing or re-filing of this Indenture, or any supplement or amendment thereto, or of any security for the Bonds issued hereunder intended to be secured hereby, or for the value or title of the property herein conveyed or otherwise as to the maintenance of the security hereof.

The Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or surety in respect of the execution of the said trusts and powers.

(b) The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing of all Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an Event of Default has occurred (which has not been cured) the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

**Section 9.4 Evidence on Which Fiduciaries May Act.**  
(a) Each Fiduciary, upon receipt of any notice, direction, resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other paper or document furnished to it pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, shall examine such instrument to determine whether it conforms to the requirements of this Indenture and shall be protected in acting upon any such instrument believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. Each Fiduciary may consult with any consultant, accountant, or counsel, who may or may not be counsel to the Issuer, and the opinion of such consultant, accountant, or counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered by it under this Indenture in good faith and in accordance therewith and the Trustee shall be under no duty to make any investigation or inquiry into any statements contained or matters referred to in any such instrument.

(b) Whenever any Fiduciary shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering any action under this Indenture, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be therein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a Written Certificate of the Issuer, and such certificate shall be full warrant for any action taken or suffered in good faith under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof; but in its discretion the Fiduciary may in lieu thereof accept other evidence of such fact or matter or may require such further or additional evidence as it may deem reasonable. Neither the Trustee, the Bond Registrar nor the Paying Agent shall be bound to recognize any Person as a Bondholder or to take any action at its request unless its Bond shall be deposited with such entity or satisfactory evidence of the ownership of such Bond shall be furnished to such entity.

(c) The Trustee shall have the right to accept and act upon directions given pursuant to this Indenture, or any other document reasonably relating to the Bonds and delivered using Electronic Means; provided, however, that the Issuer shall provide to the Trustee a Written Certificate of the Issuer listing Authorized Officers with the authority to provide such directions and containing specimen signatures of such Authorized Officers, which Written Certificate of the Issuer shall be amended whenever a person is to be added or deleted from the listing. If the Issuer elects to give the Trustee directions using Electronic Means and the Trustee in its discretion elects to act upon such directions, the Trustee’s understanding of such directions shall be deemed controlling. The Issuer understands and agrees that the Trustee cannot determine the identity of the actual sender of such directions and that the Trustee shall conclusively presume that directions that purport to have been sent by an Authorized Officer listed on the Written Certificate of the Issuer provided to the Trustee have been sent by such Authorized Officer. The Issuer shall be responsible for ensuring that only Authorized Officers transmit such directions to the Trustee and that all Authorized Officers treat applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys as confidential and with extreme care. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Trustee’s reliance upon and compliance with such directions notwithstanding such directions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written direction. The Issuer agrees: (i) to assume all risks arising out of the use of Electronic Means to submit directions to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the

<!-- Page 799 -->

Trustee acting on unauthorized directions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties; (ii) that it is fully informed of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of transmitting directions to the Trustee and that there may be more secure methods of transmitting directions, (iii) that the security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its transmission of directions provide to it a commercially reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and circumstances and (iv) to notify the Trustee immediately upon learning of any compromise or unauthorized use of the security procedures.

(d) Paper copies or “printouts” of any document, if introduced as evidence in any judicial, arbitral, mediation or other administrative proceeding, will be admissible as between the Issuer and the Trustee to the same extent and under the same conditions as other original business records created and maintained in documentary form. Neither party shall contest the admissibility of true and accurate copies of Electronically Signed Documents on the basis of the best evidence rule or as not satisfying the business records exception to the hearsay rule.

Section 9.5 Compensation. The Issuer shall pay or cause to be paid to each Fiduciary from time to time reasonable compensation for all services rendered under this Indenture, and also all reasonable expenses, charges, legal fees and other disbursements, including those of its attorneys, agents and employees, incurred in and about the performance of their powers and duties under this Indenture, in accordance with the agreements made from time to time between the Issuer and the Fiduciary. Subject to the provisions of Section 9.3, the Issuer further agrees to indemnify and save each Fiduciary harmless against, and agrees to pay or reimburse, the expenses, charges, legal fees and disbursements described in the preceding sentence. The Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement of all expenses and liabilities incurred and all advances made by the Trustee, except for expenses and liabilities incurred or advances made by the Trustee as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Section 9.6 Certain Permitted Acts. Any Fiduciary, individually or otherwise, may become the owner of any Bonds, with the same rights it would have if it were not a Fiduciary. To the extent permitted by law, any Fiduciary may act as depository for, and permit any of its officers or directors to act as a member of, or in any other capacity with respect to, any committee formed to protect the rights of Bondholders or to effect or aid in any reorganization growing out of the enforcement of the Bonds or this Indenture, whether or not any such committee shall represent the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding. Nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Bondholder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, or composition affecting the Bonds or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Bondholder in any such proceeding without the approval of the Bondholders so affected.

Section 9.7 Resignation of Trustee. The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged of the duties created by this Indenture by giving not less than forty-five (45) days’ written notice to the Issuer and mailing notice thereof to the Holders of Bonds then Outstanding, specifying the date when such resignation shall take effect, and such resignation shall take effect upon the day specified in such notice unless (a) previously a successor shall have been appointed by the Issuer or the Bondholders as provided in Section 9.9, in which event such resignation shall take effect immediately on the appointment of such successor, or (b) a successor shall not have

So long as no Event of Default, or an event which, with notice or passage of time, or both, would become an Event of Default, shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee may be removed at any time, with or without cause, upon 30 days’ notice, by a resolution of the Issuer filed with the Trustee and delivery of a Written Certificate of the Issuer to the Trustee with respect to the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such removal of the Trustee shall not be effective until a successor Trustee has been appointed pursuant to Section 9.9. The Trustee’s rights under this Indenture to indemnity and any amounts due and payable to such Trustee shall survive any such removal.

Section 9.9 Appointment of Successor Trustee. (a) In case at any time the Trustee shall resign or shall be removed or shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or if a receiver, liquidator or conservator of the Trustee, or of its property, shall be appointed, or if any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee, or of its property or affairs, a successor Trustee may be appointed by the Issuer by a duly executed written instrument signed by an Authorized Officer.

Said court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as such court may deem proper, appoint a successor Trustee.

(c) Any Trustee appointed under the provisions of this Section 9.9 in succession to the Trustee shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of any state or a national banking association and shall have capital stock, surplus and undivided earnings aggregating at least $500,000,000 if there be such a bank with trust powers or trust company or national banking association willing and able to accept the office on reasonable and customary terms and authorized by law to perform all the duties imposed upon it by this Indenture.

Section 9.10 Transfer of Rights and Property to Successor Trustee. Any successor trustee appointed under this Indenture shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to its predecessor Trustee, and also to the Issuer, an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all moneys, estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and obligations of such predecessor Trustee, with like effect as if originally named as Trustee; but the Trustee ceasing to act shall nevertheless, on the Written Request of the Issuer or of the successor Trustee, execute, acknowledge and deliver such instrument of conveyance and further assurance and do such other things as may reasonably be

Should any deed, conveyance or instrument in writing from the Issuer be required by such successor Trustee for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee any estates, rights, powers and duties, any and all such deeds, conveyances and instruments in writing shall, on request, and so far as may be authorized by law, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Issuer. Any such successor Trustee shall promptly notify the Paying Agents of its appointment as Trustee.

**Section 9.13 Resignation or Removal of Paying Agent and Appointment of Successor.** (a) Any Paying Agent may at any time resign and be discharged of the duties and obligations created by this Indenture by giving at least 45 days’ written notice to the Issuer, the Trustee and the other Paying Agents. Any Paying Agent may be removed with 30 days’ prior notice by an instrument filed with such Paying Agent and the Trustee and signed by an Authorized Officer.

![Section 9.14 Trustee’s Reliance. The Trustee may conclusively rely, and shall be protected in acting upon any notice, direction, ordinance, resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond, statement, facsimile transmission, electronic mail or other paper or document furnished to the Trustee pursuant to any provision of this Indenture and that is believed by the Trustee to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties and in conformity with the formal requirements of this Indenture. The Trustee may consult with any consultant, account, or counsel, who may or may not be counsel to the Issuer, and the opinion of such consultant, accountant, or counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered by Trustee under this Indenture in good faith and in accordance therewith. The Trustee shall be under no duty to make any investigation or inquiry into any statements contained or matters referred to in any such instrument. Any request, direction, authority or consent given by the Holders of any Bond shall be conclusive and binding upon all Holders of the same Bond and any Bond issued in its place. 

Section 9.15 Trustee’s Liability. (a) The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith, in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, in accordance with the direction of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Bonds, relating to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or, except for its negligence or willful misconduct, exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture with respect to the Bonds.

(b) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of an Event of Default except for those Events of Default in Sections 8.1(a) and (b) unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have actual knowledge of such Event of Default. As used herein, “actual knowledge” shall mean the actual fact or statement of knowing without any independent duty to make any investigation with regard thereto.

(c) The Trustee’s rights to immunities and protection from liability hereunder and its rights to payment of its fees and expenses shall survive its resignation or removal and final payment or defeasance of the Bonds. All rights, benefits, indemnifications and releases from liability granted herein to the Trustee shall extend to the directors, officers, employees, agents and counsel of the Trustee.

(d) Whenever in the administration of the trusts imposed upon it by this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a Written Certificate of the Issuer, and such Written Certificate shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken or suffered in good faith under the provisions of this Indenture in reliance upon such Written Instrument, but in its discretion the Trustee may, in lieu thereof, accept other evidence of such matter or may require such additional evidence as it may deem reasonable.

## AMENDMENTS

### Section 11.1 Mailing.

### Section 11.2 Powers of Amendment.
Any modification or amendment of this Indenture and of the rights and obligations of the Issuer and of the Holders of the Bonds thereunder may be made by a Supplemental Indenture, subject to Section 10.3(e), with the written consent given as provided in Section 11.3 (a) of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of Outstanding Bonds, and (b) in case the modification or amendment changes the terms of any Sinking Fund Installment, of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of Outstanding Bonds of the particular maturity entitled to such Sinking Fund Installment; provided, however, that if such modification or amendment will, by its terms, not take effect so long as any Bonds of any specified like maturity remain Outstanding (or are subject to mandatory purchase) the consent of the Holders of such Bonds shall not be required and such Bonds shall not be deemed to be Outstanding for the purpose of any calculation of Outstanding Bonds under this Section 11.2; and provided further, however, that if such modification or amendment would adversely affect any Interest Rate Swap Counterparty, such modification or amendment shall be subject to the prior written consent of the Interest Rate Swap Counterparty. No such modification or amendment shall permit a change in the terms of redemption or maturity of the principal of any Outstanding Bond or of any installment of interest thereon or a reduction in the principal amount or the Redemption Price thereof or in the rate of interest thereon without the consent of the Holder of such Bond, or shall reduce the percentages or otherwise affect the classes of Bonds the consent of the Holders of which is required to effect any such modification or amendment, or shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of any Fiduciary without its written assent thereto. For the purposes of this Section 11.2, the Bonds shall be deemed to be affected by a modification or amendment of this Indenture if the same adversely affects or diminishes the rights of the Holders of Bonds in any material respect. The Trustee may in its discretion determine whether or not in accordance with the foregoing powers of amendment Bonds would be materially affected by any modification or amendment of this Indenture and any such determination shall be binding and conclusive on the Issuer and all Holders of Bonds. For purposes of this Section 11.2, the Holders of any Bonds may include the initial Holders thereof, regardless of whether such Bonds are being held for resale.

Such Supplemental Indenture shall not be effective unless and until there shall have been filed with the Trustee (a) the written consents of Holders of the percentages of Outstanding

Bonds specified in Section 11.2, subject to Section 11.5(b), (b) the written consent of any Interest Rate Swap Counterparty if required by Section 11.2, and (c) an Opinion of Counsel stating that such Supplemental Indenture has been duly and lawfully executed by the Issuer in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, is authorized or permitted by this Indenture, and is valid and binding upon the Issuer and enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and may state that no opinion is being rendered as to the availability of any particular remedy. For purposes of clause (a) of the preceding sentence, the written consent of the Bondholder shall be deemed to have been received if the amendment is expressly referred to in the Supplemental Indenture authorizing such Bonds and in the text of such Bonds and such Bonds recite that such Bondholder shall be deemed to have consented to such amendments by accepting such Bonds. Otherwise, each such consent shall be effective only if accompanied by proof of the holding, at the date of such consent, of the Bonds with respect to which such consent is given, which proof shall be as permitted by Section 12.2. A certificate or certificates executed by the Trustee and filed with the Trustee and the Issuer stating that it has examined such proof and that such proof is sufficient in accordance with Section 12.2 shall be conclusive that the consents have been given by the Holders of the Bonds described in such certificate or certificates of the Trustee. Any such consent shall be irrevocable and shall be binding upon the Holder of the Bonds giving such consent and, anything in Section 12.2 to the contrary notwithstanding, upon any subsequent Holder of such Bonds and of any Bonds issued in exchange therefor (whether or not such subsequent Holder thereof has notice of such consent). At any time after the Holders of the required percentages of Bonds shall have filed their consents to the Supplemental Indenture (or have deemed to have consented to such Supplemental Indenture), the Trustee shall make and file with the Trustee and the Issuer a written statement that the Holders of such required percentages of Bonds have consented to, such Supplemental Indenture. Such written statements shall be conclusive that such consents have been received. At any time thereafter, notice stating in substance that the Supplemental Indenture (which may be referred to as a Supplemental Indenture entered into by the Issuer and the Trustee on a stated date, a copy of which is on file with the Trustee) has been consented to by the Holders of the required percentages of Bonds and will be effective as provided in this Section 11.3, may be given to Bondholders by the Trustee by mailing such notice to Bondholders (but failure to mail such notice shall not prevent such Supplemental Indenture from becoming effective and binding as in this Section 11.3 provided). A record, consisting of the certificates or statements required or permitted by this Section 11.3 to be made by the Trustee, shall be proof of the matters therein stated.

Section 11.4 Notifications by Unanimous Consent. The terms and provisions of this Indenture and the rights and obligations of the Issuer and of the Holders of the Bonds thereunder may be modified or amended in any respect upon the execution of a Supplemental Indenture by the Trustee and the Issuer, the consent of the Holders of all of the Bonds then Outstanding (such consent to be given as provided in Section 11.3), and the consent of any Interest Rate Swap Counterparty if required by Section 11.2; provided, however, that no such modification or amendment shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of any Fiduciary or any of the provisions referenced in Section 10.3(e) without the filing with the Trustee of the written assent thereto of such Fiduciary or the Commodity Swap Counterparty, respectively, in addition to the consent of the Bondholders.

If the Issuer shall pay or cause to be paid, or there shall otherwise be paid, to the Holders of any Outstanding Bonds the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due or to become due thereon, at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and in this Indenture, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any lien, benefit or security under this Indenture, and all covenants, agreements and obligations of the Issuer to the Holders of such Bonds shall thereupon cease, terminate and be discharged and satisfied except for remaining rights of registration of transfer and exchange of Bonds.

(b) Bonds or interest installments for the payment or redemption of which moneys shall have been set aside and shall be held in trust by the Paying Agents (through deposit by the Issuer of funds for such payment or redemption or otherwise) at the maturity or redemption date thereof shall be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in subsection (a). In addition, any Outstanding Bonds shall prior to the maturity or redemption date thereof be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in subsection (a) upon compliance with the provisions of subsection (c).

(c) Subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section 12.1, any Outstanding Bonds shall prior to the maturity or redemption date thereof be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in subsection (a) of this Section 12.1 if (i) in case any of said Bonds are to be redeemed on any date prior to maturity, the Issuer shall have given the Trustee irrevocable written instructions accepted in writing by the Trustee to mail as provided in Article IV notice of redemption of such Bonds (other than Bonds which have been purchased by the Trustee at the direction of the Issuer or purchased or otherwise acquired by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee as hereinafter provided prior to the mailing of such notice of redemption) on said date, (ii) there shall have been deposited with the Trustee either moneys (including moneys withdrawn and deposited pursuant to Section 5.7(g)) in an amount which shall be sufficient, or Defeasance Securities (including any Defeasance Securities issued or held in book-entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury of the United States) the principal of and the interest on which when due will provide moneys which, together with the moneys, if any, deposited with the Trustee at the same time, shall be sufficient, to pay when due the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due and to become due on said Bonds (with such interest being calculated at the Maximum Rate with respect to any Bonds with interest rates that are not fixed to their redemption or maturity date, as applicable) on or prior to the redemption date or maturity date thereof, as the case may be, and (iii) in the event said Bonds are not by their terms subject to redemption within the next succeeding 60 days, the Issuer shall have given the Trustee in form satisfactory to it irrevocable written instructions to mail, as soon as practicable, a notice to the Holders of such Bonds at their last addresses appearing upon the registry books at the close of business on the last Business Day of the month preceding the month for which notice is mailed that the deposit required by (ii) above has been made with the Trustee and that said Bonds are deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 and stating such maturity or redemption date upon which moneys are expected, subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section 12.1, to be available for the payment of the principal or Redemption Price, if

applicable, on said Bonds (other than Bonds which have been purchased by the Trustee at the direction of the Issuer or purchased or otherwise acquired by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee as hereinafter provided prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption referred to in clause (i)). Any notice of redemption mailed pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to Bonds which constitute less than all of the Outstanding Bonds of any maturity shall specify the letter and number or other distinguishing mark of each such Bond. The Trustee shall, as and to the extent necessary, apply moneys held by it pursuant to this Section 12.1 to the retirement of said Bonds in amounts equal to the unsatisfied balances (determined as provided in Section 12.1) of any Sinking Fund Installments with respect to such Bonds, all in the manner provided in this Indenture. The Trustee shall, if so directed by the Issuer (A) prior to the maturity date of Bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 which are not to be redeemed prior to their maturity date or (B) prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption referred to in clause (i) above with respect to any Bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 which are to be redeemed on any date prior to their maturity, apply moneys deposited with the Trustee in respect of such Bonds and redeem or sell Defeasance Securities so deposited with the Trustee and apply the proceeds thereof to the purchase of such Bonds and, the Trustee shall immediately thereafter cancel all such Bonds so purchased; provided, however, that the moneys and Defeasance Securities remaining on deposit with the Trustee after the purchase and cancellation of such Bonds (or the deemed cancellation thereof) shall be sufficient to pay when due the Principal Installment or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due or to become due on all Bonds (calculated as described above), in respect of which such moneys and Defeasance Securities are being held by the Trustee on or prior to the redemption date or maturity date thereof, as the case may be. If, at any time (1) prior to the maturity date of Bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 which are not to be redeemed prior to their maturity date or (2) prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption referred to in clause (i) with respect to any Bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 which are to be redeemed on any date prior to their maturity, the Trustee shall purchase or otherwise acquire any such Bonds and deliver such Bonds to the Trustee prior to their maturity date or redemption date, as the case may be, the Trustee shall immediately cancel all such Bonds so delivered; such delivery of Bonds to the Trustee shall be accompanied by directions from the Issuer to the Trustee as to the manner in which such Bonds are to be applied against the obligation of the Trustee to pay or redeem Bonds deemed paid in accordance with this Section 12.1. The directions given by the Issuer to the Trustee referred to in the preceding sentences shall also specify the portion, if any, of such Bonds so purchased or delivered and cancelled or deemed cancelled to be applied against the obligation of the Trustee to pay Bonds deemed paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 upon their maturity date or dates and the portion, if any, of such Bonds so purchased or delivered and cancelled or deemed cancelled to be applied against the obligation of the Trustee to redeem Bonds deemed paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 on any date or dates prior to their maturity. In the event that on any date as a result of any purchases, acquisitions and cancellations or deemed cancellations of Bonds as provided in this Section 12.1 the total amount of moneys and Defeasance Securities remaining on deposit with the Trustee under this Section 12.1 is in excess of the total amount which would have been required to be deposited with the Trustee on such date in respect of the remaining Bonds in order to satisfy clause (ii) of this subsection (c) of Section 12.1, the Trustee shall, if requested by the Issuer, pay the amount of such excess to the Issuer free and clear of any trust, lien, security interest, pledge or assignment securing said Bonds or otherwise existing under this Indenture. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this Section 12.1, neither Defeasance

to the Trustee, which may nevertheless in its discretion require further or other proof in cases where it deems the same desirable:

(i) The fact and date of the execution by any Bondholder or its attorney of such instruments may be proved by a guarantee of the signature thereof by a bank or trust company or by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds, that the Person signing such request or other instrument acknowledged to him the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness of such execution, duly sworn to before such notary public or other officer. Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership, on behalf of such corporation, association or partnership, such signature, guarantee, certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of its authority.

(ii) The amount of Bonds transferable by delivery held by any Person executing any instrument as a Bondholder, the date of holding such Bonds, and the numbers and other identification thereof, may be proved by a certificate, which need not be acknowledged or verified, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, executed by the Trustee or by a member of a financial firm or by an officer of a bank, trust company, insurance company, or financial corporation or other depository wherever situated, showing at the date therein mentioned that such Person exhibited to such member or officer or had on deposit with such depository the Bonds described in such certificate.

In addition to the foregoing provisions, the Trustee may from time to time make such reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable permitting other proof of holding of Bonds transferable by delivery.

(b) The ownership of Bonds registered other than to bearer and the amount, numbers and other identification, and date of holding the same shall be proved by the registry books.

(c) Any request or consent by the owner of any Bond shall bind all future owners of such Bond in respect of anything done or suffered to be done by the Issuer or any Fiduciary in accordance therewith.

The amounts held by any Fiduciary for the payment of the interest, principal or Redemption Price due on any date with respect to particular Bonds shall, on and after such date and pending such payment, be set aside on its books and held in trust by it for the Holders of the Bonds entitled thereto.

Section 12.4 Preservation and Inspection of Documents. All documents received by any Fiduciary under the provisions of this Indenture shall, at all times during regular business hours (upon reasonable prior written notice) be subject to the inspection of the Issuer, any other Fiduciary, and any Bondholder and their agents and their representatives, any of whom may make copies thereof, subject to such reasonable regulations as such Fiduciary may from time to time determine to be required by law.

**DIRECTION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY TO OPTIONALLY REDEEM COMMODITY SUPPLY REVENUE REFUNDING BONDS, SERIES 2024**

To: Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the “Trustee”)

DIRECTION IS HEREBY GIVEN BY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY (the “Issuer”) to the Trustee for the Issuer’s Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”) issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Trust Indenture, dated as of _______________ 1, 2024 between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Indenture”), to call the Bonds for redemption on _______________ (the “Redemption Date”) at a redemption price (the “Redemption Price”), calculated by a quotation agent selected by the Issuer, equal to [FOR REDEMPTIONS UNDER SECTION 4.3(a): the greater of (a) the Amortized Value of the Series 2024 Bonds as of the Redemption Date, plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date, or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining unpaid payments of principal and interest to be paid on the Series 2024 Bonds to be redeemed from and including the Redemption Date (not including any portion of the interest accrued and unpaid as of the redemption date) to the earlier of the stated maturity date of such Series 2024 Bonds or the Series 2024 Mandatory Purchase Date, discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis at a discount rate equal to the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate for such Bonds minus 0.25% per annum, plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date; or [FOR REDEMPTIONS UNDER SECTION 4.3(b) the Amortized Value of the Series 2024 Bonds as of the Redemption Date, plus $0.__ per $1,000 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date, provided that, if the optional redemption date is the Mandatory Purchase Date, the Redemption Price shall be the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption].

“Amortized Value” means, with respect to any Series 2024 Bond to be redeemed when a Fixed Rate Period is in effect with respect to such Bond, the principal amount of such Bond multiplied by the price of such Bond expressed as a percentage, calculated by a major market maker in municipal securities, as the quotation agent, selected by the Issuer, based on the industry standard method of calculating bond prices (as such industry standard prevails on the date of delivery of the Bonds), with a delivery date equal to the date of redemption, a maturity date equal to the earlier of (a) the stated maturity date of such Bond or (b) the Fixed Rate Tender Date of such Bond and a yield equal to such Bond’s original reoffering yield, which, in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds and certain dates, produces the amounts for all of the Series 2024 Bonds set forth in Schedule IV attached to the Indenture.

“Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate” means, for the Series 2024 Bonds of any maturity, the “Comparable AAA General Obligations” yield curve rate for the year of such maturity or Mandatory Purchase Date, as applicable, as published by Refinitiv Global Markets, Inc. one Business Day prior to the date of this Notice of Conditional Optional Redemption. If no such yield curve rate is established for the applicable year, the “Comparable AAA General Obligations” yield curve rate for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the applicable year shall be determined, and the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate will be

In calculating the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate, should Refinitiv Global Markets, Inc. no longer publish the “Comparable AAA General Obligations” yield curve rate, then the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate shall equal the Consensus Scale yield curve rate for the applicable year. The Consensus Scale yield curve rate is made available daily by Municipal Market Analytics and is available to its subscribers through its internet address: www.mma-research.com.

(a) All Gas delivered under this Agreement shall be delivered and received (i) at the delivery point specified in Exhibit A (the “Primary Gas Delivery Point”), or (ii) to any other point (an “Alternate Gas Delivery Point”) that has been mutually agreed by Seller and Buyer (the Primary Gas Delivery Point or Alternate Gas Delivery Point, if specified, each being a “Gas Delivery Point”).

(b) The Daily Index Price, Index Price (Low) and Monthly Index Price for each Alternate Gas Delivery Point, as applicable, shall be the price mutually agreed and identified by the Parties, or if no such price is identified for such Alternate Gas Delivery Point, the price shall be the Daily Index Price, Index Price (Low) or Monthly Index Price for such Alternate Gas Delivery Point, as applicable, specified on Exhibit A for the Primary Gas Delivery Point from which quantities are being shifted to such Alternate Gas Delivery Point. The Parties shall (i) update Exhibit A upon any change to the terms thereof, including particularly as a result of any update to the Monthly Index Price to reflect a change in the Delivery Point Premium as defined in and established pursuant to the terms of the Commodity Supply Contract, and (ii) deliver a copy of such updated Exhibit A to the Swap Counterparty consistent with the terms of the Buyer Swap and the Seller Swap.

(c) All Electricity delivered under this Agreement shall be delivered (i) at the delivery point set forth in Exhibit A (the “Primary Electricity Delivery Point”), (ii) at one of the secondary delivery points set forth in Exhibit A with six (6) Months’ prior notice from Buyer (the “Secondary Electricity Delivery Points”), (iii) to any other point (an “Alternate Electricity Delivery Point”) that has been mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller or selected by Buyer pursuant to the following sentence or (iv) any applicable Assigned Delivery Point specified in an Assignment Schedule with respect to Assigned Electricity (the Primary Electricity Delivery Point, Secondary Electricity Delivery Point, Alternate Electricity Delivery Point or Assigned Delivery Point, if specified, each being an “Electricity Delivery Point”). Upon twelve (12) Months’ prior written notice to Seller, Buyer may select the California-Oregon Border (“COB”) as an Alternate Electricity Delivery Point provided that (A) Seller, within six (6) months after receiving such notice, confirms that it is able to obtain reliable Electricity supply for the Contract Quantity to be delivered hereunder at COB, (B) Seller may limit such period of deliveries at COB to three (3) years, without prejudice to Buyer’s ability to re-select COB as an Alternate Electricity Delivery Point in the future, and (C) Seller and Buyer are able to mutually agree upon the Day-Ahead Market Price and Real-Time Market Price that will apply for COB. Delivery of Electricity to Buyer at the Primary Electricity Delivery Point and the Secondary Electricity Delivery Points specified in Exhibit A shall be facilitated through submission of Inter-Scheduling Coordinator Trades (“ISTs”). The Project Participant shall designate a scheduling coordinator in the CAISO market for this purpose as specified in Exhibit G-2.

(d) The Day-Ahead Market Price and Real-Time Market Price for each Alternate Electricity Delivery Point, as applicable, shall be the price mutually agreed and identified by the Parties, or if no such price is identified for such Alternate Electricity Delivery Point, the
<!-- Page 875 -->

price shall be the Day-Ahead Market Price and Real-Time Market Price for such Alternate Electricity Delivery Point, as applicable, specified on Exhibit A for the Primary Electricity Delivery Point from which quantities are being shifted to such Alternate Electricity Delivery Point.

## Section 5.2 Responsibility for Transportation; Permits.

(a) **Gas.**

(i) Seller shall obtain and pay for all processing, gathering, and transportation necessary for delivery of the Contract Quantity to each Delivery Point. Buyer shall obtain or cause to be obtained and pay for or cause payment to be made for all transportation necessary to receive the Contract Quantity at each Delivery Point and to transport the Contract Quantity from each Delivery Point.

(ii) Should either Party receive an operational flow order or other order or notice from a Transporter requiring action to be taken in connection with the Gas flowing under this Agreement (a “Critical Notice”), such Party shall notify or cause the notification of the other Party of the Critical Notice and provide or cause to be provided to the other Party a copy of same by electronic mail, or facsimile if requested, within a Commercially Reasonable timeframe. The Parties shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts required by the Critical Notice within the time prescribed by the applicable Transporter. Each Party shall, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 19.1, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from any Claims associated with any Critical Notice (i) of which the indemnifying Party failed to give the indemnified Party the notice required under this Agreement or (ii) under which the indemnifying Party failed to take the action required by the Critical Notice within the time prescribed, provided the notice from the indemnified Party was timely delivered.

(b) **Electricity.** Seller shall arrange and be responsible for transmission service of the Contract Quantity to the Delivery Point and shall Schedule or arrange for Scheduling services with its Transmission Providers, to deliver Electricity to the Delivery Point. Buyer shall arrange and be responsible for transmission service at and from the Delivery Point and shall Schedule or arrange for Scheduling services with its Transmission Providers to receive Electricity at the Delivery Point.

## Section 5.3 Title and Risk of Loss.

(a) Title to the Commodities delivered under this Agreement and risk of loss shall pass from Seller to Buyer at the Delivery Point; provided that the transfer of title and risk of loss for all Assigned Gas and Assigned Electricity shall be in accordance with the applicable Gas Assignment Agreement or PPA Assignment Agreement for any portion of the Contract Quantity for which an assignment agreement is in effect; provided further that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no indemnity obligations shall apply as between the Parties with respect to any Assigned Product or Assigned Gas (as defined in a Gas Assignment Agreement).

(b) With respect to Gas, as between the Parties, Seller shall be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession of the Gas delivered under this Agreement, and responsible for any damage or injury caused thereby, prior to the time such Gas has been delivered to Buyer at the Delivery Point. 

22
<!-- Page 876 -->
![Delivery Point Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Delivery+Point+Agreement)

Delivery Point. After delivery of Gas to Buyer at the Delivery Point, Buyer shall be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession thereof and responsible for any injury or damage caused thereby. Each Party (each, an “Indemnifying Party”) assumes all liability for and, subject to the provisions of Section 19.1, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from any Claims, including death of Persons, arising from any act or incident occurring when title to Gas is vested in the Indemnifying Party.

Section 5.4 Daily Flow Rates. For Gas other than any portion of the Gas Contract Quantity for which a Gas Assignment Agreement is in effect, for which flow rates will be addressed in the applicable Gas Assignment Agreement, Seller shall nominate, schedule and deliver, and Buyer shall nominate, schedule and take, the Contract Quantity of Gas during the Gas Delivery Period at each Delivery Point in accordance with standard Firm service requirements of the Receiving Transporter and Delivering Transporter at such Delivery Point, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, neither Party in any case shall be obligated to incur additional costs by procuring additional services, running imbalances or taking any other actions to accommodate non-standard scheduling requirements of the other Party.

Section 5.5 Imbalances. The Parties shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to avoid the imposition of any Imbalance Charges. If Buyer or Seller receives an invoice from a Transporter that includes Imbalance Charges related to the obligations of either Party under this Agreement, the Parties shall determine the validity as well as the cause of such Imbalance Charges. If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of Buyer’s taking of quantities of Gas greater than or less than the Contract Quantity at any Delivery Point, then Buyer shall pay for such Imbalance Charges or reimburse Seller for such Imbalance Charges paid by Seller. If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of Seller’s delivery of quantities of Gas greater than or less than the Contract Quantities at any Delivery Point, then Seller shall pay for such Imbalance Charges or reimburse Buyer for such Imbalance Charges paid by Buyer. Additionally, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5, Seller shall have no liability for Imbalance Charges in respect of any Gas required to be scheduled or delivered under an Upstream Supply Contract.

Section 5.6 Communications Protocol. Seller and Buyer shall comply with the communications protocols set forth in Exhibit G-1 for Gas deliveries and Exhibit G-2 for Electricity deliveries; provided that, for any portion of the Contract Quantity for which a Gas Assignment Agreement or a PPA Assignment Agreement is in effect, Scheduling shall be in accordance with the applicable assignment agreement.

Section 5.7 Gas Quality and Measurement. Buyer shall not be required to accept Gas delivered by Seller that does not meet the pressure, quality and heat content requirements of the Receiving Transporter as detailed in the applicable pipeline tariff. Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy against Seller with respect to any Gas that fails to meet such pressure, quality and heat content requirements shall be the right to reject non-conforming Gas and to receive payment under Article IV. If such rejected Gas meets the pressure, quality and heat content requirements of the Delivering Transporter, but does not meet such requirements of the Receiving Transporter, any such rejection by Buyer and failure to deliver by Seller shall be deemed to be excused by Force Majeure. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Article XI shall apply to any such event of Force Majeure. If such rejected Gas does not meet such requirements of either the Receiving

**Transporter or the Delivering Transporter, Seller shall be deemed to have failed to deliver any such Gas that is properly rejected. With respect to any measurement of Gas delivered or received under this Agreement at any Delivery Point, the measurement of such Gas (including the definition of Btu used in making such measurement) by the operator of such Delivery Point shall be deemed to be conclusive; provided, however, if the operator of such Delivery Point revises its measurement statements for Gas, such revision shall be effective as the measurement of Gas for the purposes of this Agreement and may be corrected pursuant to Section 14.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but without prejudice to any right of Project Participant to reject Assigned Gas under and as defined in an Upstream Supply Contract, measurement of Assigned Gas shall be as set forth in the applicable Upstream Supply Contract and Seller shall not have any liability for the failure of any Assigned Gas to meet any applicable quality requirements.**

**Section 5.8 Assigned Products. Neither Party shall have any liability under this Article V with respect to any portion of the Contract Quantity for which a Gas Assignment Agreement or a PPA Assignment Agreement is in effect.**

**ARTICLE VI. GAS ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT**

**Section 6.1 Upstream Supply Contract Assignments. The Project Participant may assign and J. Aron may agree to assume a portion of the Project Participant’s rights and obligations under an Upstream Supply Contract consistent with the terms set forth in Exhibit G-1.**

**Section 6.2 Adjustments to Contract Quantity. In connection with the execution of a Gas Assignment Agreement with an Assigned Contract Price (as defined in the relevant Gas Assignment Agreement) that is a fixed price, Seller shall revise Exhibit A to reflect appropriate adjustments to the Contract Quantity consistent with Section 8.3 of Exhibit G-1; provided such adjustments shall be reversed consistent with Section 8.3 of Exhibit G-1 following an early termination of the relevant Assignment Period.**

**ARTICLE VII. COMMODITY REMARKETING**

**Section 7.1 Commodity Remarketing. If the Project Participant is in default under its Commodity Supply Contract or does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Commodities purchased by Buyer under the Agreement as a result of (a) Project Participant’s decreased Gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period, (b) decreased demand by Project Participant’s retail customers or (c) a change in Law and requests that such Commodity be remarketed, then Buyer shall request (and pursuant to Section 4.2 may be deemed to request) remarketing services from Seller pursuant to the provisions of Exhibit C; provided that any remarketing request delivered under clause (c) above shall constitute a “Structural Remarketing Notice” and shall be subject to the following requirements:**

5 OHS NTD: Will this be defined (consistent with the Commodity Supply Agreement) in the Gas Communications Protocol? If not, add definition in Article 1. SM NTD: Thank you for clarifying. We have updated the definition in the Commodity Supply Contract to pick up Assignment Periods under Gas Assignment Agreements and PPA Assignment Agreements.

If Buyer requests remarketing of any Assigned Electricity under any of the circumstances described in the preceding sentence, then Seller will have the right to terminate the Assignment Period applicable to such Assigned Electricity effective as of the First Hour to which such remarketing applies. If Seller elects to remarket any Assigned Electricity, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to adjust the provisions of Exhibit C to reflect pricing, delivery and other terms related to such Assigned Electricity; provided that Seller shall have no obligation to remarket such Assigned Electricity unless and until Buyer and Seller have mutually agreed to such adjustments to Exhibit C

Section 7.2 Delegation of Authority. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall delegate its rights and obligations under Exhibit C to J. Aron pursuant to the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement subject to Section 11 of Exhibit C. Notwithstanding any such delegation, Seller shall remain liable to Buyer for the performance of all of Seller’s duties and obligations under this Agreement, including under Exhibit C.

ARTICLE XIV.  
PAYMENTS  
Section 14.1 Monthly Statements.  
(a) No later than the [7th] day of each Month during the Delivery Period (excluding the first Month of the Delivery Period) and the first Month following the end of the Delivery Period, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (a “Buyer’s Statement”) listing (i) for  
30
<!-- Page 884 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

each purchase of Replacement Gas or Replacement Electricity, the quantity and replacement price applicable to such purchase, and (ii) any other amounts due to Buyer in connection with this Agreement with respect to the prior Month(s).

(b) No later than the [12th] day of each Month during the Delivery Period (excluding the first Month of the Delivery Period) and the first Month following the end of the Delivery Period (the “Billing Date”), Seller shall deliver a statement (a “Billing Statement”) to Buyer indicating (i) the total amount due to Buyer, if any, under Article IV, Article V and Article VII and Exhibit C with respect to the prior Month(s), (ii) any amounts due to Seller in connection with this Agreement with respect to the prior Month(s), and (iii) the net amount due to Buyer or Seller. If the actual quantity delivered is not known by the Billing Date, Seller may provisionally prepare a Billing Statement based on Seller’s best available knowledge of the quantity of Commodities delivered, which shall not exceed the sum of the Contract Quantity of all the Gas Days or Hours (as applicable) in such Month plus any make-up quantities delivered during such Month. The invoiced quantity and amounts paid thereon (with interest calculated on the amount overpaid or underpaid by Buyer at the Default Rate) will then be adjusted on the following Month’s Billing Statement, as actual delivery information becomes available based on the actual quantity delivered. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all amounts owed to and from Seller in connection with the Commodity Project shall be paid pursuant to the SPE Master Custodial Agreement, and the Billing Statement may be provided by J. Aron, as Seller’s agent, in the form of a consolidated statement regarding all amounts owed to and from Seller in connection with the Commodity Project for each Month, including payments to be made under the Funding Agreement, the Commodity Cash and Service Agreement and the Seller Swap.

(c) Upon request by either Party, the other Party shall deliver such supporting documentation of the foregoing as such requesting Party may reasonably request.

Section 14.2 Payment.

(a) If the Billing Statement indicates an amount due from Buyer, then Buyer shall remit such amount to Seller by wire transfer (pursuant to the instructions set forth in the SPE Master Custodial Agreement), in immediately available funds, on or before the later of (i) the 25th day of the Month following the most recent Month to which such Billing Statement relates, or (ii) the 10th day following Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s Billing Statement, or if either such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day. If the Billing Statement indicates an amount due from Seller, then Seller shall remit such amount to Buyer by wire transfer (pursuant to Buyer’s instructions), in immediately available funds, on or before the later of (i) the 22nd day of the Month following the most recent Month to which such Billing Statement relates, or (ii) the 10th day following Seller’s receipt of Buyer’s Statement, or if either such day is not a Business Day, the preceding Business Day.

(b) If Buyer fails to issue a Buyer’s Statement with respect to any Month, Seller shall not be required to estimate any amounts due to Buyer for such Month, provided that Buyer may include any such amount on subsequent Buyer’s Statements issued within the next sixty (60) days. The sixty (60)-day deadline in this subsection (b) replaces the two (2)-year deadline in Section 14.5 with respect to any claim by any non-delivering Party of inaccuracy in any estimated invoice issued or payment made pursuant to this subsection (b).

31
<!-- Page 885 -->
Section 14.3  Payment of Disputed Amounts. If Seller disputes any amounts included in the Buyer’s Statement, Seller shall (a) (except in the case of manifest error) nonetheless calculate the Billing Statement based on the amounts included in Buyer’s Statement and (b) pay any amount required by the Billing Statement in accordance with Section 14.2 without regard to any right of set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or other defenses to payment that Seller may have; provided, however, that Seller shall have the right, after payment, to dispute any amounts included in a Buyer’s Statement or otherwise used to calculate payments due under this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.5(b). If Buyer disputes any amounts included in the Billing Statement, Buyer may withhold payment to the extent of the disputed amount; provided, however, that interest shall be due at the Default Rate for any withheld amount later found to have been properly due.

Section 14.4  Late Payment. If a Party owing a net payment under Section 14.2 fails to remit the full amount payable within one Business Day of when due, interest on the unpaid portion shall accrue from the date due until the date of payment at the Default Rate.

Section 14.5  Audit; Adjustments.

(a) A Party shall have the right, at its own expense, upon reasonable notice to the other Party and at reasonable times, to examine and audit and to obtain copies of the relevant portion of the books, records, and telephone recordings of the other Party to the extent reasonably necessary, but only to such extent, to verify the accuracy of any statement, charge, payment, or computation made under this Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such examination and audit reveals any material discrepancy in the other Party’s books and records, the examining Party shall have a right to be reimbursed by the other Party for costs reasonably incurred in connection with such examination and audit. This right to examine, audit, and obtain copies shall not be available with respect to proprietary information not directly relevant to transactions under this Agreement.

(b) Each Buyer’s Statement and each Billing Statement shall be conclusively presumed final and accurate and all associated claims for under- or overpayments shall be deemed waived unless such Buyer’s Statement or Billing Statement is objected to in writing, with adequate explanation and/or documentation, within two (2) years after the applicable Month of Commodity delivery.

(c) All retroactive adjustments shall be paid in full by the Party owing payment within 30 days of notice and substantiation of such inaccuracy. If the Parties are unable to agree upon any retroactive adjustments requested by either Party within the time period specified in Section 14.5(b), then either Party may pursue any remedies available with respect to such adjustments at law or in equity. Retroactive adjustments for payments made based on incorrect Buyer’s Statements or Billing Statements shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date such payment was made. Buyer shall cause Project Participant to comply with the provisions of Section 14.5(a) to the extent necessary to allow Seller to verify any amounts due under this Agreement.

Section 14.6  Netting. The Parties shall net all amounts due and owing, including any past due amounts (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include any accrued interest), arising under this Agreement such that the Party owing the greater amount shall make a single payment of the net amount to the other Party in accordance with this Article XIV. Notwithstanding

32

the foregoing, Seller shall not be entitled to net (i) any amounts that are in dispute or (ii) any payments due to Seller against (A) the Termination Payment if it becomes due, or (B) any payments due from Seller pursuant to Article IV, Article V or Exhibit C.

**Section 15.1 Assignment by Project Participant.** The Project Participant and the Buyer have agreed pursuant to Article XV of the Commodity Supply Contract that the Project Participant has the right to propose to assign certain Assigned Rights and Obligations under one or more power purchase agreements to J. Aron. If the Project Participant does so, and to the extent such assignment is accepted by J. Aron, Buyer, J. Aron, and the Project Participants have agreed to comply with Article XV of the Commodity Supply Contract. Following the effectiveness of any PPA Assignment Agreement and Assignment Schedule executed pursuant thereto, the Hourly Quantities of Electricity shall be reduced as contemplated by Article XV and Exhibit H of the Commodity Supply Contract to reflect the Commodities acquired by Seller pursuant to such assignment. References to Article XV and Exhibit H of the Commodity Supply Contract mean that Commodity Supply Contract as it originally exists, without regard to any modification, amendments, supplements or waivers thereto (including any embedded definitions or cross-referenced provisions) that have not been consented to by J. Aron in its sole discretion.

**Section 15.2 Adjustments to Swaps.** The Parties agree to issue appropriate notices to cause the Buyer and the Seller Swap to be revised such that the notional quantity under such swaps will be reduced to reflect the Reduced Hourly Quantity determined pursuant to Article XV of the Commodity Supply Contract; provided that such revisions will revert back effective as of the end of the Assignment Period pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Schedule and the applicable PPA Assignment Agreement.

**Section 15.3 Early Termination of Assignment Period.** Except for any Assignment Period that terminates contemporaneously with this Agreement, upon termination for any reason of the Assignment Period for any PPA Assignment Agreement, the Hourly Quantity shall be increased for all future periods to reverse any reductions to the Hourly Quantity made in connection with such PPA Assignment Agreement.

Section 17.2 Payments Following a Ledger Event. Following the occurrence of a Ledger Event, Seller shall pay to Buyer any amounts that become payable from J. Aron to Seller pursuant to Section 17.6 of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, which amounts will accrue from the date of a Ledger Event until (but not including) the date on which a Termination Payment Event occurs.

Section 17.3 Reserved.

Section 17.4 Remedies and Termination.

(a) Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event. Upon the occurrence of any Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event, a Commodity Delivery Termination Date shall be deemed to be designated as the end of the Month in which the Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event occurs.

(b) Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event. If at any time an Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, then the Terminating Party, by notice to the other Party specifying the relevant Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event, may designate a day not earlier than the last day of the Month in which such notice is deemed given under Article XVI as the Commodity Delivery Termination Date; provided, however, that with respect to an Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event related to a Buyer Swap or Seller Swap, the Terminating Party may, at any time after the commencement of the Swap Replacement Period, conditionally designate a Commodity Delivery Termination Date, with such designation being conditioned upon (i) the termination and failure to replace either the corresponding Seller Swap or such Buyer Swap and (ii) the Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurring no earlier than the last day of the Month in which the Swap Replacement Period ends.

(c) Effect of Commodity Delivery Termination Date. As of the Commodity Delivery Termination Date, (i) the Delivery Period shall end, (ii) the obligation of Buyer to receive delivery of Commodities from Seller under this Agreement shall terminate, and (iii) the obligation of Seller to Schedule or make any further deliveries of Commodities to Buyer under this Agreement shall terminate and, unless such Commodity Delivery Termination Date resulted from a Termination Payment Event, such obligation to deliver Commodities shall be replaced with a continuing obligation to make payment of the amounts set forth in Exhibit D-3 to Buyer until the earlier of (A) the Month in which a Termination Payment Event occurs and (B) the last due date for such payments under Exhibit D-3. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) except as set forth in this Section 17.4(c) and in Section 17.4(d), this Agreement will continue past a Commodity Delivery Termination Date, and (ii) a Termination Payment Event may arise contemporaneously with a Commodity Delivery Termination Date or at any time thereafter and the occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date shall not prevent the occurrence of a Termination Payment Event.

(d) Termination Payment Event; Early Termination Payment Date. A Termination Payment Event shall occur upon (i) a Commodity Delivery Termination Event that is
<!-- Page 892 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  

specified as a Termination Payment Event in Section 17.1 or (ii) a J. Aron Acceleration Option. Following a Termination Payment Event, Seller on the Early Termination Payment Date shall (A) pay the Termination Payment and (B) if applicable, pay the Additional Termination Payment, in each case, to the Trustee pursuant to payment instructions issued by Buyer or, in the absence of such instructions, by wire transfer. Such amounts shall be paid together with interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) from (and including) the Early Termination Payment Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Default Rate. The obligation of Seller to pay the Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date is unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby, any waiver or consent by Buyer, or any other circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of Seller or a defense of Seller to pay the Termination Payment. Seller waives all rights to set-off, counterclaim, recoupment and any other defenses that might otherwise be available to Seller with regard to Seller’s obligation to pay the Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date.

(e) Acknowledgement of Parties. The Parties acknowledge that it is impractical and difficult to assess actual damages as a result of a termination of the Delivery Period under this Agreement, and the Parties therefore agree that the payment of the Termination Payment and any applicable Additional Termination Payment or the continued payment of amounts specified in Exhibit D-3, as applicable, is a fair and reasonable pre-estimate of the actual damages that would be incurred by Buyer as a result of termination of the Delivery Period under this Agreement for any reason and is not a penalty.

(f) Exclusive Termination Rights. Neither this Agreement nor the Delivery Period may be terminated for any reason except as specified in this Article XVII and in Section 2.2. Except with respect to amounts due for periods prior to the Commodity Delivery Termination Date, the continued payment of amounts required to be made under Section 17.4(c), and, as applicable, the payment of the Termination Payment and any Additional Termination Payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for each Party upon the termination of the Delivery Period and this Agreement for any reason, including as a result of rejection of this Agreement by either Party in any bankruptcy proceedings.

(g) Payment of Investment Agreement Breakage Costs. In the event that a payment in respect of breakage costs becomes due from Buyer under a Specified Investment Agreement due to the occurrence of an Early Termination Payment Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the amount of such payment no later than the later of (A) one Business Day prior to the date such payment is required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to such Specified Investment Agreement and (B) one Business Day following receipt by Seller of a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of such payment. In the event that a payment in respect of breakage costs becomes payable to Buyer under a Specified Investment Agreement due to the occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the amount of such payment no later than one Business Day following receipt of such payment by Buyer.

Section 17.5 Replacement of Swaps.
<!-- Page 893 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

(a) Neither Party shall exercise any optional right it may have to terminate this Agreement as a result of the termination of any Seller Swap or any Buyer Swap without first complying with this Section 17.5. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees that it will not replace any Buyer Swap or Seller Swap, as applicable, unless the other Party is replacing its Buyer Swap or Seller Swap, as applicable, with the same replacement Swap Counterparty.

(b) If:
(i) any Buyer Swap or any Seller Swap terminates,
(ii) Buyer or Seller delivers a termination notice under a Buyer Swap or Seller Swap,
(iii) a Swap Counterparty delivers a termination notice under a Buyer Swap or Seller Swap, or
(iv) any Buyer Swap or any Seller Swap is otherwise reasonably anticipated to become subject to immediate termination,
then each Party whose swap is affected shall notify the other Party of the existence of such circumstances and identify the affected Buyer Swap or Seller Swap (the “Affected Swap”).

(c) Following receipt of a notice under Section 17.5(b), the Parties shall attempt to replace both the Affected Swap and the corresponding unaffected Seller Swap or Buyer Swap with the same Swap Counterparty (the “Unaffected Swap”) by:
(i) if a Buyer Swap and a Seller Swap with another Swap Counterparty are in effect and otherwise are not subject to termination, (A) exercise any rights they may have to increase their notional quantities under such Buyer Swap and Seller Swap in order to effect a replacement upon termination of the Affected Swap (which increase shall be deemed to be a replacement of both the Buyer Swap and Seller Swap for purposes of Section 17.5 if the full notional quantities of the Affected Swap are thereby replaced), and (B) subsequent to such a replacement, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to locate replacement agreements with a second Swap Counterparty and, upon locating a second Swap Counterparty, Seller and Buyer shall reduce their notional quantities under the remaining Seller Swap and Buyer Swap to their original levels and enter into a replacement Seller Swap and Buyer Swap with the replacement Swap Counterparty for the remaining notional quantities; or
(ii) to the extent Seller or Buyer cannot increase their notional quantities under another Buyer Swap and Seller Swap as contemplated by clause (i), cooperate in good faith to locate replacement agreements with an alternate Swap Counterparty to replace both the relevant Seller Swap and Buyer Swap within the Swap Replacement Period.

(d) The “Swap Replacement Period” is a period (I) commencing on the earlier of the date of (x) any termination of a Buyer Swap or Seller Swap designated by a Swap Counterparty, and (y) delivery of a notice of anticipated termination of a Buyer Swap or Seller.
<!-- Page 894 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
Swap by a Swap Counterparty, and (II) ending 60 days after the commencement of the Swap Replacement Period, provided that if during a Swap Replacement Period Seller:

(i) presents to Buyer a proposed alternate Swap Counterparty,

(ii) requests in writing that Buyer enter into a replacement swap with such alternate Swap Counterparty, and

(iii) agrees to pay Buyer’s reasonable expenses in connection therewith,

then, to the extent permitted by the Buyer Swap and the Bond Indenture and as requested by Seller, Buyer shall: (A) enter into a master agreement with such alternate Swap Counterparty and (B) either (1) terminate the Buyer Swap when permitted thereby and enter into a replacement transaction under such new master agreement to the same effect as the terminated Buyer Swap, (2) cause such Buyer Swap to be novated to such replacement Swap Counterparty, or (3) reduce the notional quantities under its existing Buyer Swap to the level prior to the increase thereof.

(e) If a Seller Swap terminates or is no longer in effect and a Prepay LLC Payments Period (as defined in the Seller Swap Custodial Agreements) is in effect, then, during such Prepay LLC Payments Period, Seller in connection with the delivery of Commodities hereunder shall comply with the terms of the applicable Seller Swap Custodial Agreement and make all payments as and when required under such Seller Swap Custodial Agreement. If a Buyer Swap terminates or is no longer in effect and an Issuer Payments Period (as defined in the Buyer Swap Custodial Agreements) is in effect, then, during such Issuer Payments Period, Buyer in connection with the delivery of Commodities hereunder shall comply with the terms of the applicable Buyer Swap Custodial Agreement and make all payments as and when required under such Buyer Swap Custodial Agreement. The Parties agree that during any Prepay LLC Payments Period and during any Issuer Payments Period, Seller shall act as calculation agent under the applicable Seller Swap Custodial Agreement or the applicable Buyer Swap Custodial Agreement with respect to any terminated Seller Swap or Buyer Swap. Seller agrees not to permit any amendment or other modification to a Seller Swap Custodial Agreement that could adversely affect the right of Buyer to receive payments pursuant such Seller Swap Custodial Agreement. Buyer agrees not to permit any amendment or other modification to a Buyer Swap Custodial Agreement that could adversely affect the right of Seller to receive payments pursuant to such Buyer Swap Custodial Agreement.

Section 17.6 Present Assignment and Waiver of Right to Additional Termination Payments.

(a) The Parties hereto acknowledge that (i) the terms of the Buyer Swap do not entitle Buyer to any payments in respect of any termination of the Buyer Swap other than for Unpaid Amounts (as therein defined), (ii) the terms of the Seller Swap do not entitle the Swap Counterparty to any payments in respect of any termination of a Seller Swap other than in respect of Unpaid Amounts (as defined therein), and (iii) pursuant to the terms of the Buyer Swap, the Swap Counterparty has assigned to Buyer all rights to any payments and rights to receive payments that such Swap Counterparty receives or becomes entitled to receive in the future arising as a result of or otherwise in respect of any termination of a Seller Swap, excluding only any right for
<!-- Page 895 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
the Swap Counterparty to receive Unpaid Amounts (as defined therein) (any such payment under clause (iii), excluding any such Unpaid Amounts, a “Seller Swap MTM Payment”). As additional consideration hereunder, Buyer hereby transfers and assigns to Seller all of Buyer’s right, title, and interest to all payments and rights to receive payments, if any, that Buyer receives or becomes entitled to receive in the future arising as a result of or otherwise in respect of a Seller Swap MTM Payment. Buyer agrees that it will not take any steps to enforce any right to receive any payments that it has assigned to Seller pursuant to this Section 17.6(a).

(b) The Parties further acknowledge that the terms of the Seller Swaps do not entitle Seller to any payments in respect of any termination of a Seller Swap other than Unpaid Amounts (as defined therein). Nonetheless, Seller hereby presently transfers and assigns to Buyer all of Seller’s right, title and interest to any payments and rights to receive payments that Seller receives or becomes entitled to receive in the future arising as a result of or otherwise in respect of any early termination of a Seller Swap, excluding only any right for Seller to receive Unpaid Amounts thereunder.

Section 17.7 Limitation on Damages. THE PARTIES CONFIRM THAT THE EXPRESS REMEDIES AND MEASURES OF DAMAGES PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT SATISFY THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSES HEREOF. FOR BREACH OF ANY PROVISION FOR WHICH AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS HEREIN PROVIDED, SUCH EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, THE OBLIGOR’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED AS SET FORTH IN SUCH PROVISION, AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES FOR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION, OR OTHERWISE. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE NEGLIGENCE OF EITHER PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE. TO THE EXTENT ANY DAMAGES REQUIRED TO BE PAID UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE LIQUIDATED, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE, OTHERWISE OBTAINING AN ADEQUATE REMEDY IS INCONVENIENT, AND THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CONSTITUTE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE HARM OR LOSS. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF DAMAGES THAT WOULD MAKE THE PARTIES WHOLE, THE PARTIES HAVE THOROUGHLY CONSIDERED, INTER ALIA, THE UNCERTAINTY OF FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES, THE ABILITY AND INTENTION OF THE PARTIES TO HEDGE SUCH FLUCTUATIONS, THE BARGAINED-FOR ALLOCATION OF RISK, THE KNOWLEDGE, SOPHISTICATION AND EQUAL BARGAINING POWER OF THE PARTIES, THE ARMS-LENGTH NATURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS TRANSACTION, THE ACCOUNTING AND TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTION BY THE PARTIES, AND THE ENTERING INTO OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS IN RELIANCE ON THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISIONS CONTAINED HEREIN. THE PARTIES

ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A SALE OF GOODS SUBJECT TO ARTICLE 2 OF THE NEW YORK UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, §§ 2-706(6), 2-711, 2-718, AND 2-719.

**Section 17.8 Option to Purchase Bonds.** In connection with any new Interest Rate Period established under the Bond Indenture after the initial Interest Rate Period, Seller shall have the option to purchase Bonds to be remarked on the relevant Mandatory Purchase Date by delivering written notice to Buyer and the Trustee no later than the last Business Day of the Reset Period that Seller will purchase a quantity of Bonds necessary to avoid the occurrence of a Failed Remarketing. In the event that Seller exercises such option, (x) Seller shall be obligated to pay the purchase price of such Bonds in immediately available funds on the Mandatory Purchase Date, and (y) to the extent any CSC Remarketing Elections are in effect with respect to the Reset Period commencing immediately prior to such Interest Rate Period, then Seller shall be required to remarket the Contract Quantities associated with such CSC Remarketing Elections, provided that:

(a) Seller shall be entitled to purchase such Commodities for its own account,

(b) for all such Commodities, regardless of how it is remarked, Seller shall pay Buyer the amount determined pursuant to Section 5(d)(i) of Exhibit C, and

(c) to the extent that it is determined that interest on the Bonds purchased by Seller is not excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, Section 7 through Section 10 of Exhibit C shall not apply to any such remarketing.

**Section 17.9 Termination Payment Adjustment Schedule.** Seller shall prepare revisions to the then-current Exhibit D-2 (Termination Payment Adjustment Schedule) in connection with each successive Interest Rate Period pursuant to the terms of the Re-Pricing Agreement by delivering a revised Exhibit D-2 to Buyer no later than the last day of the applicable Reset Period, in which case such amendments will be effective as of the first day of the next Interest Rate Period.

**ARTICLE XVIII. RECEIVABLES PURCHASES**

In accordance with the provisions of Exhibit E, Seller has the option to purchase Call Receivables (as defined in Exhibit E). The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Call Receivables purchased by Seller under Exhibit E shall be re-purchased by J. Aron from Seller to the extent the conditions set forth in Exhibit C of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement are satisfied.

**ARTICLE XIX. MISCELLANEOUS**

**Section 19.1 Indemnification Procedure.** With respect to each indemnification included in this Agreement, the indemnity is given to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the following provisions shall be applicable.

assume its investigation and defense, including employment of counsel, and shall be obligated to pay related court costs, attorneys’ fees and experts’ fees and to post any appeals bonds; provided, however, that the indemnified Party shall have the right to employ at its expense separate counsel and participate in the defense of any Claim. The indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of a Claim without its express written consent thereto. In order to prevent double recovery, the indemnified Party shall reimburse the indemnifying Party for payments or costs incurred in respect of an indemnity with the proceeds of any judgment, insurance, bond, surety or other recovery made by the indemnified Party with respect to a covered event.

**Section 19.2 Deliveries.** No later than delivery of the Prepayment, Buyer will deliver to Seller a copy of the Bond Indenture. The following documents shall be executed and delivered by the Parties contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement (unless otherwise specified):

(c) by Seller, evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer of (i) Seller’s authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and (ii) the appropriate individuals who are authorized to sign this Agreement.

**Section 19.3 Entirety; Amendments.**

(a) This Agreement, the Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Re-Pricing Agreement, including the exhibits and attachments hereto and thereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior discussions and agreements between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations affecting the same subject matter other than those expressed herein and in the Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Re-Pricing Agreement. Except for any matters that, in accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement, may be resolved by oral agreement between the Parties, no amendment, modification, supplement or change hereto shall be enforceable unless reduced to writing and executed by both Parties.

(b) If a Ledger Event occurs, then Buyer and Seller may, upon mutual agreement in each Party’s sole discretion, amend this Agreement to reduce the Contract Quantity for one or more subsequent Months and to obligate Seller to pay the Trustee for the account of Buyer, an amount sufficient, together with other funds available under the terms of the Bond Indenture for such purpose, to pay the redemption price of such Bonds due on such redemption date and any settlement payable by Buyer due to the corresponding amendment to the Buyer Swap, and Buyer and Seller may simultaneously amend Exhibit D to reduce the Termination Payment.
<!-- Page 898 -->
for one or more such Months, but in each case only if Buyer and Seller have delivered to the Trustee:

(i) An executed counterpart of such amendment;

(ii) An executed counterpart of an amendment to the Commodity Supply Contract reducing the Contract Quantity to be sold and delivered thereunder in the same Months by the same quantities;

transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any materially adverse manner as to either Party.

Section 19.8 Winding Up Arrangements.

Section 19.11 Rates and Indices.

(a) Daily Gas Reference Prices.

(i) Price Replacement Process for Gas, Fewer than Six Consecutive Gas Days. If a Daily Commodity Reference Price for Gas is not available for any Gas Day for any reason, then such Daily Commodity Reference Price for such Gas Day shall be the average of the following: (A) the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price for the first Gas Day for which a price has been published that immediately precedes the relevant Gas Day; and (B) the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price for the first Gas Day for which a Daily Commodity Reference Price is published that immediately follows the relevant Gas Day; provided that any unavailability of a Daily Commodity Reference Price lasting for six (6) or more consecutive Gas Days or arising from a permanent cessation of publication of such Daily Commodity Reference Price shall be resolved in accordance with clause (ii) or clause (iii) of this Section 19.11(a), respectively.

(ii) Price Replacement Process, Electricity or Six or More Consecutive Gas Days. If a Daily Commodity Reference Price for Electricity is not available for any Hour or a Daily Commodity Reference Price for Gas is not available for six (6) consecutive Gas Days but, either case, such Daily Commodity Reference Price has not permanently
<!-- Page 900 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

ceased to be published, then the Parties shall promptly endeavor to agree on an alternative source for determination of such Daily Commodity Reference Price for the applicable Gas Days or Hours. If such agreement is not reached by the Parties within three (3) Business Days, the Parties shall request quotations for the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price from four (4) recognized dealers in the applicable Commodity (two (2) selected by each Party) for the period that such Daily Commodity Reference Price is expected to be unavailable. If four (4) quotations are provided as requested, the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price for the applicable Gas Days or Hours shall be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by each recognized dealer after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then one (1) of such quotations shall be disregarded. If exactly three (3) quotations are provided, the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price for the applicable Gas Days or Hours shall be the quotation provided by the relevant dealer that remains after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then the value of the two (2) quotations with the same value shall control. If fewer than three (3) quotations are received, the Parties shall seek additional quotations until at least three (3) have been received.

(iii) Price Replacement Process for Non-Published Index. If a Daily Commodity Reference Price is not available because it has permanently ceased to be published, then the Parties shall promptly endeavor to agree on an alternative source for determination of such Daily Commodity Reference Price, which may include relying upon a published index or a basket of published indices (“Daily Replacement Index”) from which to seek quotes for basis differentials as the replacement for the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price. If such agreement is not reached by the Parties within three (3) Business Days, then the Daily Replacement Index shall be selected by Seller, acting reasonably. The Parties shall request quotations from four (4) recognized dealers in the applicable Commodity (two (2) selected by each Party) for a basis differential (“Daily Basis Differential”) between the Daily Replacement Index and physical prices at the relevant Delivery Point for the remaining term of this Agreement. If four (4) quotations are provided as requested, the Daily Basis Differential will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by each recognized dealer, after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then one (1) of such quotations shall be disregarded. If exactly three (3) quotations are provided, the Daily Basis Differential shall be the quotation provided by the relevant dealer that remains after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then the value of the two (2) quotations with the same value shall control. If fewer than three (3) quotations are provided, the Parties shall seek additional quotations until at least three (3) have been received. The applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price shall be the Daily Replacement Index plus the Daily Basis Differential calculated in accordance with the provisions of this clause (iii).

(b) Monthly Index Prices.
<!-- Page 901 -->
(i) Price Replacement Process. If a Monthly Index Price is not available for any Gas Day for any reason (but such Monthly Index Price has not permanently ceased to be published), then the Parties shall promptly endeavor to negotiate in good faith to select a suitable substitute price. If such agreement is not reached by the Parties within three (3) Business Days, the Parties shall request quotations from four (4) recognized dealers in Gas (two (2) selected by each Party). If four (4) quotations are provided as requested, the applicable Monthly Index Price for that Gas Day shall be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by each recognized dealer after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then one (1) of such quotations shall be disregarded. If exactly three (3) quotations are provided, the applicable Monthly Index Price for that Gas Day shall be the quotation provided by the relevant dealer that remains after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then the value of the two (2) quotations with the same value shall control. If fewer than three (3) quotations are provided, the Parties shall seek additional quotations until at least three (3) have been received.

(ii) Price Replacement Process for Non-Published Index. If a Monthly Index Price is not available because it has permanently ceased to be published, then the Parties shall promptly endeavor to agree on an alternative source for determination of such Monthly Index Price, which may include agreeing upon a published index or a basket of published indices (“Monthly Replacement Index”) from which to seek quotes for basis differentials as the replacement for the applicable Monthly Index Price. If agreement is not reached by the Parties within three (3) Business Days, then the Monthly Replacement Index shall be selected by Seller, acting reasonably. The Parties shall request quotations from four (4) recognized dealers in Gas (two (2) selected by each Party) for a basis differential (“Monthly Basis Differential”) between the Monthly Replacement Index and physical prices at the relevant Delivery Point for the remaining term of this Agreement. If four (4) quotations are provided as requested, the Monthly Basis Differential shall be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by each recognized dealer after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then one (1) of such quotations shall be disregarded. If exactly three (3) quotations are provided, the Monthly Basis Differential shall be the quotation provided by the relevant dealer that remains after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then the value of the two (2) quotations with the same value shall control. If fewer than three (3) quotations are provided, the Parties shall seek additional quotations until at least three (3) have been received. The applicable Monthly Index Price shall be the Monthly Replacement Index plus the Monthly Basis Differential calculated in accordance with the provisions of this clause (ii).

(c) Corrections. If a value published for any rate or index used or to be used in this Agreement is subsequently corrected and the correction is published or announced by the Person responsible for that publication or announcement within thirty (30) days after the original publication or announcement, either Party may notify the other Party of (i) that correction and (ii) the amount (if any) that is payable as a result of that correction. If, not later than thirty (30) days after publication or announcement of that correction, a Party gives notice that an amount is 11
<!-- Page 902 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

so payable, the Party that originally either received or retained such amount shall, not later than three (3) Business Days after the effectiveness of that notice, pay, subject to any other applicable provisions of this Agreement, to the other Party that amount, together with interest on that amount at the Default Rate for the period from and including the day on which a payment originally was (or was not) made to but excluding the day of payment of the refund or payment resulting from that correction.

**Section 19.12 Limitation of Liability.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, including without limitation all obligations to make payments of any kind whatsoever, are special, limited obligations of Buyer, payable solely from the Trust Estate (as such term is defined in the Bond Indenture) as and to the extent provided in the Bond Indenture, including with respect to Operating Expenses (as such term is defined in the Bond Indenture). Buyer shall not be required to advance any moneys derived from any source other than the Revenues (as such term is defined in the Bond Indenture) and other assets pledged under the Bond Indenture for any of the purposes in this Agreement mentioned. Neither the faith and credit of Buyer nor the taxing power of the State of California or any political subdivision thereof is pledged to payments pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall not be directly, indirectly, contingently or otherwise liable for any costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims or actions, of any conceivable kind on any conceivable theory, under or by reasons of or in connection with this Agreement, except solely to the extent Revenues (as such term is defined in the Bond Indenture) are received for the payment thereof and may be applied therefor pursuant to the terms of the Bond Indenture.

**Section 19.13 Counterparts.** This Agreement may be executed and acknowledged in multiple counterparts and by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which shall be and constitute one and the same instrument.

**Section 19.14 Modification of and Compliance with Bond Indenture.** Buyer agrees and covenants that, as long as this Agreement is in effect, it shall not amend or consent to the amendment of any provision of the Bond Indenture (including without limitation Article V of the Bond Indenture), or fail to comply with any covenant applying to Buyer thereunder, that would, in any such case, be reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on Seller, J. Aron, the effectiveness of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

**Section 19.15 Rights of Trustee.** Pursuant to the terms of the Bond Indenture, Buyer has irrevocably appointed the Trustee as its agent to issue notices (including Remarketing Notices) and as directed under the Bond Indenture, to take any other actions that Buyer is required or permitted to take under this Agreement. Seller may rely on notices or other actions taken by Buyer or the Trustee and Seller has the right to exclusively rely on any notices delivered by the Trustee, regardless of any conflicting notices that it may receive from Buyer.

**Section 19.16 Waiver of Defenses.** Seller waives all rights to set-off, counterclaim, recoupment and any other defenses that might otherwise be available to Seller with regard to Seller’s obligations pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

**Section 19.17 Rate Changes.**  
12
<!-- Page 903 -->
(a) Absent the agreement of the Parties to the proposed change, the standard of review for changes to any rate, charge, classification, term or condition of this Agreement, whether proposed by a Party (to the extent that any waiver in Section 19.17(b) below is unenforceable or ineffective as to such Party), a non-party or FERC acting sua sponte, shall solely be the “public interest” application of the “just and reasonable” standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956) and Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348 (1956) and clarified by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish, 554 U.S. 527 (2008).

(b) In addition, and notwithstanding Section 19.17(a), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party, for itself and its successors and assigns, hereby expressly and irrevocably waives any rights it can or may have, now or in the future, whether under Section 205 and/or 206 of the Federal Power Act or otherwise, to seek to obtain from FERC by any means, directly or indirectly (through complaint, investigation or otherwise), and each hereby covenants and agrees not at any time to seek to obtain, an order from FERC changing any section of this Agreement specifying the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition agreed to by the Parties, it being the express intent of the Parties that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, neither Party shall unilaterally seek to obtain from FERC any relief changing the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition of this Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent changes in applicable Law or market conditions that may occur. In the event it were to be determined that applicable Law precludes the Parties from waiving their rights to seek changes from FERC to their market-based power sales contracts (including entering into covenants not to do so) then this Section 19.17(b) shall not apply; provided that, consistent with Section 19.17(a), neither Party shall seek any such changes except solely under the “public interest” application of the “just and reasonable” standard of review and otherwise as set forth in Section 19.17(a).

Section 19.18 U.S. Resolution Stay Provisions. Seller and Buyer hereby confirm that they are adherents to the ISDA 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (“ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol”), the terms of the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol are incorporated into and form a part of this Agreement, and for the purposes of such incorporation, (i) Seller shall be deemed to be a Regulated Entity, (ii) Buyer shall be deemed to be an Adhering Party, and (iii) this Agreement shall be deemed a Protocol Covered Agreement. In the event of any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol, the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol will prevail.7

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Prepaid Commodity Sales Agreement to be duly executed and delivered by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.

<!-- Page 911 -->
(a) Generally. To request remarketing under this Exhibit C, Buyer must issue a Remarketing Notice substantially in the form attached to Exhibit G to the Agreement, which Remarketing Notice must state (i) the portion of the Contract Quantity to be remarketed from each relevant Delivery Point, and (ii) either (A) during the Gas Delivery Period, the Gas Day or Gas Days in which such portion of the Contract Quantity is to be remarketed, or (B) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Delivery Hours in which such portion of the Contract Quantity is to be remarketed.

(b) Monthly Remarketing Notice. During the Electricity Delivery Period, Buyer may designate a Remarketing Notice as a “Monthly Remarketing Notice” if the Remarketing Notice is delivered to Seller not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the start of the first Month in which it applies and applies to a period of one (1) Month or more. During the Gas Delivery Period, Buyer may designate a Remarketing Notice as a “Monthly Remarketing Notice” if the Remarketing Notice:

(i) applies to one (1) or more full Months;

(ii) specifies an equal quantity of Gas to be remarketed from each relevant Delivery Point on each Gas Day in each relevant Month; and

(iii) either (A) is delivered to Seller not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the last day of exchange trading for Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange (or any successor thereto) for deliveries in the first Month to which such Remarketing Notice applies or (B) with respect to any Month for which Buyer is suspending or terminating Gas deliveries to Project Participant in accordance with the provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract, is delivered to Seller not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the first Month to which such Remarketing Notice applies.

(c) Daily Remarketing Notice.

(i) is delivered to Seller not later than 8:30 am CPT two (2) Business Days prior to nominations leaving control of the nominating Party for the first timely nomination cycle for the Transporter for the Gas Day and at the Delivery Point where such Gas was originally intended to be delivered; provided, however, if a Transporter modifies its nomination process, Seller may propose to modify the preceding deadline, subject to Buyer’s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and

(ii) specifies an equal quantity of Gas to be remarketed on Gas Days covering a weekend or any other set of Gas Days that is generally scheduled as a block in the Gas industry. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer may only issue a single Remarketing Notice for any such set of Gas Days covering the weekend or other relevant block of Gas Days.

(iii) In the event the payment due date under a Qualified Sale or Non-Private Business Sale has not yet occurred prior to the date upon which payment is due under this Agreement for the applicable Month, the Parties shall nonetheless issue statements as if the full amount from such Qualified Sale or Non-Private Business Sale had been paid and, if such full payment is not received prior to the next Monthly due date under this Agreement, the Parties shall issue the appropriate statements to reflect the actual proceeds received and true-up any difference.

For purposes of the foregoing, Seller shall be considered to have resolved such Electricity to the extent Seller shall have entered into one or more arrangements in a Commercially Reasonable manner whereby Seller repurchases its obligation to purchase and receive Electricity from another party at the Delivery Point

RF = The Remarketing Fee

AF = The Administrative Fee, provided that the Administrative Fee shall not apply during the Electricity Delivery Period unless such Deemed Remarketing Notice results from Buyer’s failure to Schedule pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Agreement

Section 7. Tracking Remarketing Proceeds. Seller shall maintain four (4) separate ledgers related to remarketing proceeds as described below:

(a) One (1) ledger (the “Non-Private Business Sales Ledger”) shall include, (A) as dollar credits, the Non-Private Business Remarketing Proceeds, and (B) as a Unit credit, the Units of Commodities corresponding to such Non-Private Business Remarketing Proceeds.

(b) Another ledger (the “Private Business Sales Ledger”) shall include, (A) as dollar credits, Private Business Remarketing Proceeds, and (B) as a Unit credit, the Units of Commodities corresponding to such Private Business Remarketing Proceeds.

(c) The other two (2) ledgers shall be maintained as described in Section 9(a) of this Exhibit C.

(d) The credits to be recorded in the ledgers described in Section 7(a) and (b) of this Exhibit C (collectively, the “Ledger Entries”) shall be dated as of the first day of the Month prior to the Month in which Buyer or Project Participant receives the proceeds corresponding to such Ledger Entries.
<!-- Page 916 -->
(e) The four (4) ledgers described in Section 7 of this Exhibit C and all debits and credits to such ledgers shall be kept on an aggregate basis for purposes of this Exhibit C.

(f) Buyer shall provide to Seller all reports provided by a Project Participant pursuant to Section 7.5 of the applicable Commodity Supply Contract. To the extent set forth in Section 7.6(a) of the applicable Commodity Supply Contract, Seller will add “Disqualified Sale Proceeds” to the appropriate ledgers described above.

**Section 8. Remediation Remarketing and Bond Redemptions.**

(a) At any time that the net Ledger Entry balance of either the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger or the Private Business Sales Ledger is greater than zero (0):

(b) Buyer shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to utilize the proceeds represented by the dollar balances of such Ledger Entries to purchase Commodities for resale in Qualified Sales and shall promptly notify Seller following such purchase and sale.

(c) Seller shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to locate opportunities for Buyer to purchase Commodities to sell in Qualified Sales to remediate the proceeds represented by the dollar balances of the Ledger Entries. In this regard, if Seller locates a Remediation Remarketing opportunity, then

(i) Seller shall notify Buyer of such opportunity;

(ii) Buyer shall, upon receipt of such notice, purchase Commodities from Seller at a price determined by Seller in a Commercially Reasonable manner based upon applicable market prices at the location where the remarketing opportunity sale will occur (the “Remediation Remarketing Purchase Price”);

(iii) Seller shall remarket such Commodities on Buyer’s behalf in a Qualified Sale;

(iv) Seller shall remit to Buyer the proceeds collected from such Qualified Sale, but in no event shall Seller remit less than the Minimum Remarketing Sales Price for the remarketing transaction; provided, however, that to the extent Seller does not receive the Remediation Remarketing Purchase Price from Buyer prior to the Remediation Remarketing described herein, Seller shall credit the proceeds collected from such remarketing sale against the Remediation Remarketing Purchase Price owed to Seller, and Seller shall be reimbursed from the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund to the extent necessary to make Seller whole for such Qualified Sale; and

(v) Seller shall issue to Buyer a confirmation notice (including the dollar price and Units) of each purchase of Commodities by or on behalf of Buyer, and each sale of Commodities on Buyer’s behalf, under this Section 8, and amounts due from or to Buyer shall be separately stated on the Billing Statement for the Month in which such remarketing transactions occur.

C-9
<!-- Page 917 -->
For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not sell, nor be required to sell, Commodities to Buyer for a Remediation Remarketing if such Commodities are to be remarkedeted by Seller on behalf of Buyer for less than the Minimum Remarketing Sales Price.

(d) Unless the terms of a Remediation Remarketing undertaken by Seller on Buyer’s behalf are specifically assumed by Buyer, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any costs or liabilities associated with such Remediation Remarketing (other than costs related to the price at which such Commodities are sold and the risk of collecting the sale proceeds from the remarketing buyer), including, without limitation, any cover or replacement costs; termination payments; fees, penalties, costs or charges (in cash or in kind) assessed by any Transporter for failure to satisfy its balance or nomination requirements; Claims for breach of warranty; taxes, fees, levies, penalties, licenses or charges imposed by any Government Agency; and Claims from personal injury or property damages.

(e) The total purchase price of any Commodities purchased by Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section 8(c) of this Exhibit C will be entered by Seller as a dollar debit on (i) first, the Private Business Sales Ledger, if and to the extent such ledger has a positive balance and such Commodities are remarkedeted in a Qualified Sale and (ii) second, on the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger, if and to the extent such ledger has a positive balance, the Private Business Sales Ledger has a zero (0) balance, and such Commodities are remarkedeted in a Qualified Sale, with such debit in the case of (i) or (ii) dated as of the last day of the Month in which such Commodities were purchased. Each dollar debit shall offset and reverse an equal amount of the dollar credits to such ledger that had previously been made in the Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger or the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger in the order in which they were made (beginning with the oldest credit not previously offset and reversed by any prior debit). Whenever a debit is made to the dollar balance of the Ledger Entries of either such ledger, Seller shall also debit the Commodities balance of the Ledger Entries of such ledger based on (i) such dollar debit divided by (ii) an average Commodities price calculated from the net Ledger Entry then present on the relevant ledger being debited. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger nor the Private Business Sales Ledger shall ever have a negative balance, and the same purchase transaction shall not result in a debit to more than one ledger except to the extent that a debit for the transaction causes one (1) ledger to have a zero (0) balance and the remaining portion of the permitted debit is made to the other ledger.

(f) In addition to the ability of Seller or Buyer to engage in Remediation Remarketing to reduce the balances of any Ledger Entries through Qualified Sales of the Commodity (either Gas or Electricity) that was originally remarkedeted the proceeds represented by the dollar balances of such Ledger Entries may also be remediated through the purchase of the other Commodity (either Electricity or Gas) that will be remarkedeted in Qualified Sales. If Seller locates an opportunity for Buyer to purchase the other Commodity for a Remediation Remarketing, the provisions of Section 8c shall apply to such opportunity provided that the entry of unit debits shall be made as follows:

(i) To the extent the Ledger Entries for Units consist of MMBtus, for any Remediation Remarketing of Electricity, a quantity of MMBtus will be debited based on (i) the total proceeds paid for such Electricity divided by (ii) an average Gas price. 

C-10
<!-- Page 918 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image) 

calculated from the net Ledger Entry balance then present on the relevant ledger being debited.

(ii) To the extent the Ledger Entries for Units consist of MWhs, for any Remediation Remarketing of Gas, a quantity of MWhs will be debited based on (i) the total proceeds paid for such Gas divided by (ii) an average Electricity price calculated from the net Ledger Entry balance then present on the relevant ledger being debited.

(g) In the event that (i) the Project Participant remediates the proceeds represented by the dollar balances of the Ledger Entries pursuant to Section 7.5 of the Commodity Supply Contract or (ii) Bonds are redeemed pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.6(c) of the Commodity Supply Contract and Section 4.01(b) of the Bond Indenture, the corresponding Ledger Entries then present on any ledger shall be debited.

(h) Upon the Switch Date, all Ledger Entries for Units consisting of MMBtus shall be converted to MWhs based on an average Gas price calculated from the net Ledger Entry balance then present on the relevant ledger being debited.

Section 9. Ledger Event.

(a) In addition to the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger and the Private Business Sales Ledger described in Section 7(a) and (b) of this Exhibit C, above, Seller shall also maintain an “Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger” and an “Expired Private Business Sales Ledger.” Whenever a credit to the dollar balance of the Ledger Entries of the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger has not been reversed in full within two (2) years of such credit by an offsetting dollar debit in accordance with Section 8(c) or (d) of this Exhibit C, then Seller shall (i) debit the remaining portion of such dollar credit and the Unit balance of the Ledger Entries in the manner described in the penultimate sentence of Section 8(c) and (ii) record such debits as credits to the Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger. Similarly, whenever a credit to the dollar balance of the Ledger Entries of the Private Business Sales Ledger has not been reversed in full within two (2) years of such credit by an offsetting dollar debit in accordance with Section 8(c) or (d) of this Exhibit C, then Seller shall (i) debit the remaining portion of such dollar credit and the Unit balance of the Ledger Entries in the manner described in the penultimate sentence of Section 8(c) and (ii) record such debits as credits to the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger. Pursuant to Section 19.3(b) of the Agreement, upon any partial redemption of Bonds in accordance with the Bond Indenture, the dollar credits made to either the Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger or the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger shall be reduced (in the order of entry) by an aggregate amount corresponding to the principal amount of Bonds so redeemed, and the Unit credits to such ledgers shall be reduced by the contemporaneous Unit credits corresponding to the dollar credits so reduced.

(b) No later than the tenth (10th) day of each Month, Seller shall provide to Buyer copies of the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger, the Private Business Sales Ledger, the Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger and the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger showing all credits and debits to each such ledger since the Execution Date, in each case if a credit has been recorded in such ledger since the Execution Date.

C-11
<!-- Page 919 -->
(c) A “Ledger Event” shall occur if, at any time, either (i) (A) the sum of all Btu credits on the Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger and the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger exceeds (B) the Non-Qualifying Remarketing Limit, or (ii) (A) the sum of all Btu credits on the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger exceeds (B) the Private Business Remarketing Limit.

(d) The occurrence of a Ledger Event and any remedies associated therewith in Article XVII of the Agreement shall be Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedies with respect to any inability by Seller to purchase and remarket Commodities for Buyer pursuant to, or any breach by Seller of its obligations under, this Exhibit C.

Section 10. Remarketing of Contract Quantities under Gas Assignment Agreement or PPA Assignment Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein but subject to the immediately following sentence of this Section 10, if (a) a quantity of Commodities less than (x) the Assigned Gas Quantity as defined in a Gas Assignment Agreement or (y) the Assigned Prepay Quantity as defined in a PPA Assignment Agreement is delivered or taken hereunder in any Month during an Assignment Period for any reason other than Force Majeure, then (i) Buyer will be deemed to have requested Seller to remarket the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered (regardless of whether a Remarketing Notice was delivered) and (ii) Seller shall sell such Commodities or cause such Commodities to be sold in a Private Business Sale at the Contract Specified Price minus the applicable Remarketing Fee. Seller shall pay Buyer for any such Month the product of (I) the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered, multiplied by (II) the Contract Specified Price minus the applicable Remarketing Fee, and such sales shall constitute a Private Business Sale and shall be reflected on the Private Business Sales Ledger.

Section 2.1 Reserved.

Section 2.2 Swap Deficiency Receivables. Prepay LLC shall have an option to purchase certain Swap Deficiency Receivables from Issuer as described in this Section 2.2. Issuer shall sell to Prepay LLC, and Prepay LLC shall purchase, certain Swap Deficiency Receivables under the following circumstances:

(a) If (i) the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under the Commodity Supply Contract with Issuer and (ii) such payment default results in a Swap Payment Deficiency, then on the Business Day following the day on which such default occurs, Issuer shall deliver a written offer (a “Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer”) in the form of Attachment 3 to this Exhibit to sell to Prepay LLC, at par, sufficient receivables (“Swap Deficiency Receivables”) (such amount, less any undisputed amounts owed by Issuer to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, the “Swap Deficiency Receivables Amount”) to fund the Swap Payment Deficiency. Such Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer shall identify the Project Participant and include aging information and the face amount of the corresponding Swap Deficiency Receivables.

(b) No later than the Business Day following Prepay LLC’s receipt of a Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer, Prepay LLC may, but shall be under no obligation to, elect to purchase the Swap Deficiency Receivables referenced in the Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer by delivering a written notice (a “Swap Deficiency Receivable Option Notice”) in the form of Attachment 4 to this Exhibit to Issuer and the Trustee of Prepay LLC’s intent to purchase such Swap Deficiency Receivables (collectively, the “Swap Deficiency Identified Receivables”). The Swap Deficiency Receivable Option Notice will specify a Purchase Date that will be no later than the Payment Date (as defined in the Confirmation to the Buyer Swap) for the month in which Prepay LLC receives the Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer. If Prepay LLC does not deliver a Swap Deficiency Receivable Option Notice to Issuer and the Trustee on or before the Business Day following Prepay LLC’s receipt of a Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer, Prepay LLC will be deemed to have elected not to purchase the referenced Swap Deficiency Receivables.

(iii) if Prepay LLC has elected to purchase Swap Deficiency Receivables, on the Purchase Date thereof written notice that the Purchase Price has been received by the Trustee pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof;

provided that, in addition to the foregoing, the Trustee shall deliver written notice to the Custodian if any Swap Payment Deficiency is otherwise cured on the date that such Swap Payment Deficiency is cured.

Section 2.3 Elective Receivables. Prepay LLC shall have an option to purchase certain Elective Receivables from Issuer as described in this Section 2.3. Issuer shall sell to Prepay LLC, and Prepay LLC shall purchase, certain Elective Receivables under the following circumstances:

(a) To the extent the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under the Commodity Supply Contract and such payment default does not result in a Swap Payment Deficiency, then on such Business Day, Issuer shall deliver a written offer (a “Elective Receivables Offer”) in the form of Attachment 5 to sell to Prepay LLC, at the receivables relating to such payment default (“Elective Receivables”) (such amount, less any undisputed amounts owed by Issuer to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, the “Elective Receivables Amount”). Such Elective Receivables Offer shall identify the Project Participant and include aging information and the face amount of the corresponding Elective Receivables.

(b) At any time after the receipt of an Elective Receivables Offer, Prepay LLC may, but shall be under no obligation to, elect to purchase the Elective Receivables referenced in the Elective Receivables Offer by delivering a written notice (an “Elective Receivable Option Notice”) in the form of Attachment 6 to this Exhibit to Issuer and the Trustee of Prepay LLC’s intent to purchase such Elective Receivables (collectively, the “Elective Identified Receivables”).

(b) Conditions Precedent to Issuer’s Obligation to Sell. Issuer’s obligation to sell the Identified Receivables pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Exhibit shall be subject to the following conditions precedent being satisfied on each Purchase Date:

(i) Prepay LLC and Issuer shall each have delivered to Issuer and the Trustee a duly executed counterpart of a Bill of Sale with respect to the sale of the Identified Receivables in the form of Attachment 1 hereto; and

(ii) The representations and warranties of Prepay LLC in Article VIII of the Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects.

Prepay LLC, while it holds title to any Identified Receivables purchased hereunder, and any such third party transferee, while it holds title to such Identified Receivables, shall be the “Transferee”; provided that (a) any provisions herein that set forth obligations of the Transferee shall be interpreted as requiring Prepay LLC to cause any third party transferee to comply with such provisions and (b) any Transferee other than Prepay LLC shall be a third party beneficiary of the provisions benefiting the Transferee and shall have the right to enforce such provisions. Prepay LLC shall provide prompt notice to Issuer and the Trustee of a transfer of Identified Receivables consistent with this Section 2.7, which notice shall include a notice address and payment instructions for any such Transferee.

If any amounts are paid to Issuer or the Trustee by the Project Participant with respect to an Identified Receivable that has been sold in whole or in part to the Transferee under this Exhibit, Issuer shall promptly pay any such receipts to the Transferee without setoff of any kind.

The Transferee or Issuer may submit a request to the other parties to discuss coordination of collection efforts with respect to the Project Participant. Upon receipt of such request, the parties shall discuss in good faith coordination of collection efforts.

Section 2.14 Excess Payments. If at any time the Transferee receives an amount from any source in respect of any Identified Receivable in excess of the Purchase Price of such Identified Receivable, such amount shall be applied as follows: (i) if such amount is identifiable as payment in respect of the principal amount owing in respect of such Identified Receivable, the Transferee shall remit such amount to the Trustee; and (ii) if such amount is not identifiable as payment in respect of the principal as aforesaid, such amount shall first be credited towards any unpaid interest due to the Transferee under Section 2.11 above, and the Transferee shall remit to the Trustee any portion thereof in excess of any such interest.

REPURCHASE OF IDENTIFIED RECEIVABLES

Section 3.1 Repurchase of Identified Receivables. To the extent Identified Receivables sold to Prepay LLC remain unpaid by the Project Participant, Issuer shall have the right, on any day on which the Transferee has not been paid the full Repurchase Price for Identified Receivables that have been sold to Prepay LLC hereunder, to repurchase in whole or in part one or more Identified Receivables in accordance with this Section 3.1. Issuer shall deliver notice to Prepay LLC setting forth the portion of the Identified Receivables to be repurchased by Issuer (the “Repurchase Notice”). The repurchase date for the Identified Receivables specified in the Repurchase Notice (“Repurchase Date”) shall be a date designated by Issuer that is no later than 12:00 noon New York City time on the first Business Day following receipt of such Repurchase Notice. In the event that funds to be used to repurchase Identified Receivables are insufficient to repurchase all outstanding Identified Receivables, Issuer shall use such funds to repurchase Identified Receivables in the order in which such Identified Receivables were sold to Prepay LLC, in minimum denominations of $1,000.00.

Section 3.2 Repurchase and Transfer of Identified Receivables. On the Repurchase Date, Prepay LLC shall sell, transfer, assign, convey and deliver to Issuer, free and clear of all Encumbrances, all of Prepay LLC’s right, title and interest in and to the portion of the Identified Receivables specified in the applicable Repurchase Notice.

The consideration for the portion of the Identified Receivables identified in the Repurchase Notice to be repurchased by Issuer (the “Repurchase Price”) shall be equal to the Purchase Price for such portion of the Identified Receivables minus all payments received by Prepay LLC with respect to such portion of the Identified Receivables. For the avoidance of doubt, the Repurchase Price for an Identified Receivable.
<!-- Page 931 -->

Receivable shall not be adjusted for the amount of any interest accrued from the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract since the Purchase Date of such Identified Receivable.

(i) The Commodity Supply Contract pursuant to which an Identified Receivable is owed to Issuer is a valid and binding obligation of Issuer, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, is in full force and effect, and has not been amended or supplemented in any material manner or respect except as otherwise indicated to the Transferee.

(ii) There are no breaches or defaults by Issuer of any of its obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract. Except as resulted from the action or omission of the Transferee, no other events have occurred that (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) would result in a breach or default by Issuer under any such Commodity Supply Contract.

(iii) None of the rights of Issuer under the Commodity Supply Contract will be impaired by the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Exhibit.

(iv) Other than with respect to the Bond Indenture or with respect to transactions pursuant to this Exhibit, Issuer has not entered into any agreement (A) with any third party for the sale of the Commodity Supply Contract, (B) that grants any right or interest in the Commodity Supply Contract to any third party or (C) that encumbers in any manner any amounts receivable under the Commodity Supply Contract.

(v) The Commodity Supply Contract is managed and operated by the management and employees and contractors of Issuer and are not subject to any contract, agreement, or arrangement, written or oral, that purports to transfer any right or obligation to manage or operate the Commodity Supply Contract to any third Person.

If any proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an indemnified party or any successor thereto (the “Indemnified Person”) in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Section 5.2 from an indemnifying person or any successor thereto (the “Indemnifying Person”), the Indemnified Person shall give written notice of such proceeding to the Indemnifying Person who shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person and the payment of all expenses; provided, that any delay or failure so to notify the Indemnifying Person shall relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations hereunder only to the extent, if at all, that it is prejudiced by such delay or failure. In no event shall the Indemnified Person be required to make any expenditure or bring any cause of action to enforce the Indemnifying Person’s obligations and liability under and pursuant to the indemnifications set forth in this Section 5.2. The Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any of the foregoing proceedings and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Person unless the Indemnified Person shall in good faith determine that there exist actual or potential conflicts of interest which make representation by the same counsel inappropriate. In the event that the Indemnifying Person, within five days after notice of any such proceeding, fails to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Person shall have the right to undertake the defense, subject to the right of the Indemnifying Person to assume the defense of such proceeding with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person at any time prior to the settlement, compromise or final determination thereof. Anything in this Section 5.2 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Person shall not, without the Indemnified Person’s prior written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, settle or compromise any proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any proceeding; provided that the Indemnifying Person may, without the consent of the Indemnified Person, settle any proceeding for the payment of money with no other liability and no admission of responsibility.

(e) Survival. The indemnifications included in this Exhibit shall survive termination of the Agreement.

Section 5.3 Modification of Bond Indenture. Issuer agrees and covenants that, as long as this Agreement is in effect, it shall not amend or consent to the amendment of any
<!-- Page 935 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

provision of the Bond Indenture (including without limitation Article V of the Bond Indenture) that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the effectiveness of this Exhibit or the transactions contemplated by this Exhibit without the prior written consent of the Transferee, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

Section 5.4 Non-Severability; Miscellaneous. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of the parties pursuant to this Exhibit are an integral part of this Agreement and may not be severed from such agreement in any way whatsoever, whether by transfer, assignment or otherwise.

Section 5.5 Certain Terms Relating to the Trustee.

(d) Notwithstanding any term hereof to the contrary and for the avoidance of doubt, it is acknowledged and agreed that the Trustee shall have the authority to take such actions as it may deem necessary under this Exhibit as agent and on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to and as provided in the Bond Indenture (subject to the rights retained by the Issuer thereunder, in the absence of conflicting actions by the Trustee, to exercise its rights hereunder), including without limitation the right of the Trustee upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Bond Indenture to notify the Issuer to cease exercising its rights hereunder.

ARTICLE IV  
FAILURE TO DELIVER OR TAKE COMMODITIES

Section 4.1 Issuer’s Failure to Deliver the Contract Quantity (Not Due to Force Majeure).

(a) If, on any Gas Day during the Gas Delivery Period or for any Delivery Hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, Issuer breaches its obligation to deliver all or any portion of the Contract Quantity at any Delivery Point pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then the portion of the Contract Quantity that Issuer failed to deliver shall be a “Shortfall Quantity” and Purchaser shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to purchase Replacement Gas (during the Gas Delivery Period) or Replacement Electricity (during the Electricity Delivery Period).

(b) To the extent Purchaser actually purchases Replacement Gas (during the Gas Delivery Period) or Replacement Electricity (during the Electricity Delivery Period) with respect to any Shortfall Quantity, then Issuer shall pay to Purchaser the result determined by the following formula:

P = Q x (RP – CP + AF)

Where:

P = The amount payable by Issuer under this Section 4.1(b);  
Q = The quantity of Replacement Gas or Replacement Electricity Purchased;  
RP = The Replacement Gas Price or Replacement Electricity Price, as applicable;  
16
<!-- Page 978 -->
CP  =  The Contract Price that would have applied to such Commodity;  
AF  =  The Administrative Fee.  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in a case where Project Participant actually purchases Replacement Electricity (during the Electricity Delivery Period) with respect to any Shortfall Quantity at a Secondary Electricity Delivery Point, Issuer shall pay to Purchaser the result of the quantity of Replacement Electricity purchased multiplied by the Day-Ahead Market Price applicable to the Delivery Hour and the Delivery Point for which the Shortfall Quantity arose.  

(c) Purchaser shall monitor nominations and deliveries of Commodities to be delivered to Purchaser at each Delivery Point and shall promptly notify Issuer upon becoming aware that such nominations or deliveries might result in a Shortfall Quantity with respect to such Delivery Point.  

(d) Purchaser shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate Issuer’s damages paid hereunder; provided that, such Commercially Reasonable Efforts shall not require Purchaser to utilize or change its utilization of its owned or controlled assets or market positions to minimize Issuer’s liability.  

(e) Imbalance Charges for Gas shall not be recovered under this Section 4.1, but rather in accordance with Section 5.5.  

**Section 4.2 Purchaser’s Failure to Take the Contract Quantity (Not Due to Force Majeure).** If, on any Gas Day during the Gas Delivery Period or for any Delivery Hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, Purchaser breaches its obligation to take all or any portion of the Contract Quantity at any Delivery Point pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then Purchaser shall remain obligated to pay Issuer the Contract Price for the Contract Quantity. Issuer shall credit to Purchaser’s account any net revenues Issuer may receive from Prepay LLC under the Prepaid Agreement in connection with the ultimate sale of any such Commodities by Prepay LLC to other Municipal Utilities, up to the Contract Price.  

**Section 4.3 Sole Remedies.** Except with respect to the payment of Imbalance Charges pursuant to Section 5.5, the remedies set forth in this Article IV shall be each Party’s sole and exclusive remedies for any failure by the other Party to deliver or take Commodities, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement.  

**Section 4.4 Limitations.** Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither Party shall have any liability or other obligation to the other under this Article IV with respect to a failure to take or deliver any portion of the Contract Quantity for which a Gas Assignment Agreement or a PPA Assignment Agreement is in effect.

Each Party (each, an “Indemnifying Party”) assumes all liability for and, subject to the provisions of Section 18.1, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from any Claims, including death of Persons, arising from any act or incident occurring when title to Gas is vested in the Indemnifying Party.

Section 5.4 Daily Flow Rates. For Gas other than any portion of the Contract Quantity of Gas for which a Gas Assignment Agreement is in effect, for which flow rates will be addressed in the applicable Gas Assignment Agreement, Issuer shall nominate, Schedule and deliver, and Purchaser shall nominate, Schedule and take, the Contract Quantity of Gas during the Gas Delivery.

Period at each Delivery Point in accordance with standard Firm service requirements of the Receiving Transporter and Delivering Transporter at such Delivery Point, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, neither Party in any case shall be obligated to incur additional costs by procuring additional services, running imbalances or taking any other actions to accommodate non-standard scheduling requirements of the other Party.

**Section 5.5 Imbalances.** The Parties shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to avoid the imposition of any Imbalance Charges. If Purchaser or Issuer receives an invoice from a Transporter that includes Imbalance Charges related to the obligations of either Party under this Agreement, the Parties shall determine the validity as well as the cause of such Imbalance Charges. If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of Purchaser’s taking of quantities of Gas greater than or less than the Contract Quantity at any Delivery Point, then Purchaser shall pay for such Imbalance Charges or reimburse Issuer for such Imbalance Charges paid by Issuer.

Purchaser’s sole and exclusive remedy against Issuer with respect to any Gas that fails to meet such pressure, quality and heat content requirements shall be the right to reject such non-conforming Gas and to receive payment under Article IV. If such rejected Gas meets the pressure, quality and heat content requirements of the Delivering Transporter, but does not meet such requirements of the Receiving Transporter, any such rejection by Purchaser and failure to deliver by Issuer shall be deemed to be excused by Force Majeure. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Article XI shall apply to any such event of Force Majeure. If such rejected Gas does not meet such requirements of either the Receiving Transporter or the Delivering Transporter, Issuer shall be deemed to have failed to deliver any such Gas that is properly rejected. With respect to any measurement of Gas delivered or received under this Agreement at any Delivery Point, the measurement of such Gas (including the definition of Btu used in making such measurement) by the operator of such Delivery Point shall be deemed to be conclusive; provided, however, if the operator of such Delivery Point revises its measurement statements for Gas, such revision shall be effective as the measurement of Gas for the purposes of this Agreement and may be corrected pursuant to Section 14.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but without prejudice to any right of Project Participant to reject Assigned Gas under and as defined in a Gas Assignment Agreement, measurement of Assigned Gas shall be as set forth in the applicable Upstream Supply Contract and Issuer shall not have any liability for the failure of any Assigned Gas to meet any applicable quality requirements.

## PAYMENTS

### Section 14.1 Monthly Statements.

(a) No later than the 7th day of each Month during the Delivery Period (excluding the first Month of the Delivery Period) and the first Month following the end of the Delivery Period, Purchaser shall deliver to Issuer a statement (a “Purchaser’s Statement”) listing (i) for each purchase of Replacement Gas or Replacement Electric, the quantity and replacement price applicable to such purchase, and (ii) any other amounts due to Purchaser in connection with this Agreement with respect to the prior Month(s).

(b) No later than the 12th day of each Month during the Delivery Period (excluding the first Month of the Delivery Period) and the first Month following the end of the Delivery Period (the “Billing Date”), Issuer shall deliver a statement (a “Billing Statement”) to Purchaser indicating (i) the total amount due to Issuer for Commodities delivered in the prior Month, (ii) any other amounts due to Issuer or Purchaser in connection with this Agreement with respect to the prior Month(s), and (iii) the net amount due to Issuer or Purchaser. If the actual quantity delivered is not known by the Billing Date, Issuer may provisionally prepare a Billing Statement based on Issuer’s best available knowledge of the quantity of Commodities delivered, which shall not exceed the sum of the Contract Quantity of all the Gas Days or Hours (as applicable) in such Month plus any make-up quantities delivered during such Month. The invoiced quantity and amounts paid thereon (with interest calculated on the amount overpaid or underpaid by Purchaser at the Default Rate) will then be adjusted on the following Month’s Billing Statement, as actual delivery information becomes available based on the actual quantity delivered.

(c) Upon request by either Party, the other Party shall deliver such supporting documentation of the foregoing as such requesting Party may reasonably request.

### Section 14.2 Payment.

(a) If the Billing Statement indicates an amount due from Purchaser, then Purchaser shall remit such amount to the Trustee for the benefit of Issuer by wire transfer (pursuant
<!-- Page 989 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
**Section 14.3 Payment of Disputed Amounts.** If Purchaser disputes any amounts included in Issuer’s Billing Statement, Purchaser shall (except in the case of manifest error) nonetheless pay any amount provided by the Billing Statement in accordance with Section 14.2 without regard to any right of set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or other defenses to payment that Purchaser may have; provided, however, that Purchaser shall have the right, after payment, to dispute any amounts included in a Billing Statement or otherwise used to calculate amounts due under this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.5. If Issuer disputes any amounts included in the Purchaser’s Statement, Issuer may withhold payment to the extent of the disputed amount; provided, however, that interest shall be due at the Default Rate for any withheld amount later found to have been properly due.

**Section 14.4 Late Payment.** If Purchaser fails to remit the full amount payable within one Business Day of when due, interest on the unpaid portion shall accrue from the date due until the date of payment at the Default Rate.

**Section 14.5 Audit; Adjustments.**

(a) A Party shall have the right, at its own expense, upon reasonable notice to the other Party and at reasonable times, to examine and audit and to obtain copies of the relevant portion of the books, records, and telephone recordings of the other Party to the extent reasonably necessary, but only to such extent, to verify the accuracy of any statement, charge, payment, or computation made under this Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such examination and audit reveals any material discrepancy in the other Party’s books and records, the examining Party shall have a right to be reimbursed by the other Party for costs reasonably incurred in connection with such examination and audit. This right to examine, audit, and obtain copies shall not be available with respect to proprietary information not directly relevant to transactions under this Agreement.

(b) Each Purchaser’s Statement and each Billing Statement shall be conclusively presumed final and accurate and all associated claims for under- or overpayments shall be deemed waived unless such Purchaser’s Statement or Billing Statement is objected to in.
<!-- Page 990 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

writing, with adequate explanation and/or documentation, within two (2) years after the applicable Month of Commodity delivery.

(c) All retroactive adjustments shall be paid in full by the Party owing payment within 30 days of notice and substantiation of such inaccuracy. If the Parties are unable to agree upon any retroactive adjustments requested by either Party within the time period specified in Section 14.5(b), then either Party may pursue any remedies available with respect to such adjustments at law or in equity. Retroactive adjustments for payments made based on incorrect Billing Statement(s) shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date such payment was made.

Section 14.6 Netting: No Set-Off. The Parties shall net all amounts due and owing, including any past due amounts (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include any accrued interest), arising under this Agreement such that the Party owing the greater amount shall make a single payment of the net amount to the other Party in accordance with this Article XIV. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment for all amounts set forth in a Billing Statement provided to Purchaser shall be made without set-off or counterclaim of any kind.

Section 14.7 Source of Purchaser’s Payments. Purchaser covenants and agrees to make payments due hereunder from Utility Revenues, and only from such Utility Revenues, as an operating expense of its utility system or an Energy Payment (as defined in Section 14.9); provided, however, that Purchaser may apply any legally available monies to the payment of amounts due hereunder.

Section 14.8 Rate Covenant. Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees that it will establish, fix, prescribe, maintain, and collect rates, fees, and charges from the customers of its utility system so as to provide Utility Revenues sufficient to enable Purchaser to pay any other amounts legally payable from Utility Revenues, and to maintain any required reserves for Purchaser’s utility system. Purchaser further covenants and agrees that it shall not furnish or supply services free of charge to any Person, except any such service free of charge that Purchaser is supplying on the date hereof as has been specifically identified by Purchaser to Issuer in writing, and it shall promptly enforce the payment of any and all accounts owing to Purchaser for the sale of Commodities or the provision of distribution or other services to its customers. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any payments hereunder except from Utility Revenues.

Section 14.9 Pledge of Utility Revenues. Purchaser shall not grant any lien on or security interest in, or otherwise pledge or encumber, the Utility Revenues if the terms or effect of such lien, pledge or other encumbrance results in such lien, pledge or other encumbrance having priority over the obligations of Purchaser to pay the Contract Price for its Contract Quantities hereunder, which obligations constitute operating expenses or Energy Payments (as such term is defined in Purchaser’s Resolution No. 6649, adopted January 7, 1971, as amended and supplemented through May 18, 2024) of Purchaser.

Section 18.13 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed and acknowledged in multiple counterparts and by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which shall be and constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 18.14 Third Party Beneficiaries; Rights of Trustee. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (a) Issuer will pledge and assign its rights, title and interest in this Agreement and the amounts payable by Purchaser under this Agreement to secure Issuer’s obligations under the Bond Indenture, (b) the Trustee shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement with the right to enforce Purchaser’s obligations under this Agreement, (c) the Trustee or any receiver appointed under the Bond Indenture shall have the right to perform all obligations of Issuer under this Agreement, and (d) in the event of any Purchaser Defaults under Section 17.2(a), (i) Prepay LLC may, to the extent provided for in, and in accordance with, the Receivables Purchase Provisions (as defined in the Bond Indenture), take assignment from Issuer of receivables owed by Purchaser to Issuer under this Agreement, and Prepay LLC or any third party transferee who purchases and takes assignment of such receivables from Prepay LLC shall thereafter have all rights of collection with respect to such receivables, and (ii) if such receivables are not so assigned, the Swap Counterparty (as defined in the Bond Indenture) shall have the right to pursue collection of such receivables to the extent of any non-payment by Issuer to the Swap Counterparty was caused by Purchaser’s payment default. Pursuant to the terms of the Bond Indenture, Issuer has irrevocably appointed the Trustee as its agent to issue notices and as directed under the Bond Indenture, to take any other actions that Issuer is required or permitted to take under this Agreement.

<!-- Page 998 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

proposed by a Party (to the extent that any waiver in Section 18.16(b) below is unenforceable or ineffective as to such Party), a non-party or FERC acting sua sponte, shall solely be the “public interest” application of the “just and reasonable” standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956) and Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348 (1956) and clarified by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish, 554 U.S. 527 (2008).

(b) In addition, and notwithstanding Section 18.16(a), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party, for itself and its successors and assigns, hereby expressly and irrevocably waives any rights it can or may have, now or in the future, whether under Section 205 and/or 206 of the Federal Power Act or otherwise, to seek to obtain from FERC by any means, directly or indirectly (through complaint, investigation or otherwise), and each hereby covenants and agrees not at any time to seek to obtain, an order from FERC changing any section of this Agreement specifying the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition agreed to by the Parties, it being the express intent of the Parties that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, neither Party shall unilaterally seek to obtain from FERC any relief changing the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition of this Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent changes in applicable Law or market conditions that may occur. In the event it were to be determined that applicable Law precludes the Parties from waiving their rights to seek changes from FERC to their market-based power sales contracts (including entering into covenants not to do so) then this Section 18.16(b) shall not apply; provided that, consistent with Section 18.16(a), neither Party shall seek any such changes except solely under the “public interest” application of the “just and reasonable” standard of review and otherwise as set forth in Section 18.16(a).

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Amended & Restated Commodity Supply Contract to be duly executed and delivered by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.

## FORM OF FEDERAL TAX CERTIFICATE  

[___], 2024  

This Federal Tax Certificate is executed in connection with the Amended & Restated Commodity Supply Contract dated as of [___], 2024 (the “Supply Contract”), by and between Northern California Energy Authority (“Issuer”) and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“Purchaser”). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Supply Contract, in the Tax Certificate and Agreement, or in the Bond Indenture.  

WHEREAS Purchaser acknowledges that Issuer is issuing the Bonds to fund the prepayment price under the Prepaid Agreement; and  

WHEREAS the Bonds are intended to qualify for tax exemption under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and  

WHEREAS Purchaser’s use of Commodities acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract and certain funds and accounts of Purchaser will affect the Bonds’ qualification for such tax exemption.  

NOW, THEREFORE, PURCHASER HEREBY CERTIFIES AS FOLLOWS:  

1. Purchaser is a municipal utility district created and existing pursuant to the provisions of organized under the provisions of the Municipal Utility District Act (Division 6, Chapter 2, Articles 2 and 3, Sections 11581 through 11614 of the California Public Utilities Code, as amended).  

2. Purchaser will resell Electricity acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract and use all Gas acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract to generate Electricity that is resold, in each case, to its retail Electricity customers within its service area, with retail sales in all cases being made pursuant to regularly established and generally applicable tariffs or under authorized requirements contracts. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the term “service area” means (x) the area throughout which Purchaser provided Electricity transmission or distribution service at all times during the 5-year period ending on [December 31, 2023], and from then until the date of issuance of the Bonds (the “Closing Date”), and (y) any area recognized as the service area of Purchaser under state or federal law.  

3. The annual average amount during the testing period of Gas purchased (other than for resale) used by Purchaser to generate Electricity that is purchased (other than for resale) by customers of Purchaser who are located within the service area of Purchaser is [_____] MMBtu. The maximum annual amount of Gas in any year being acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract is [_____] MMBtu. The annual average amount of Gas that Purchaser holds in storage as of the Closing Date is [_____] MMBtu. The annual average amount of Gas that Purchaser otherwise has a right to acquire as of the Closing Date is [_____] MMBtu. The sum of (a) the maximum amount of Gas in any year being acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract, (b) the annual average amount of Gas which Purchaser holds in storage, and (c) the amount of Gas which Purchaser otherwise has a right to acquire in the year described in the foregoing clause (a) is D-1
<!-- Page 1005 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

[_____] MMBtu. Accordingly, the amount of Gas to be acquired under the Supply Contract by Purchaser, supplemented by the amount of Gas otherwise available to Purchaser as of the Closing Date, during any year does not exceed the sum of (i) [__]% of the annual average amount during the testing period of Gas purchased to generate Electricity that is purchased (other than for resale) by customers of Purchaser who are located within the service area of Purchaser; and (ii) the amount of Gas to be used to transport the prepaid Gas to Purchaser during such year. For purposes of this paragraph 3, the term "testing period" means the 5 calendar years ending [December 31, 2023], and the term "service area" means (x) the area throughout which Purchaser provided Gas distribution service at all times during the testing period, (y) any area within a county contiguous to the area described in (x) in which retail customers of Purchaser are located if such area is not also served by another utility providing Gas services, and (z) any area recognized as the service area of Purchaser under state or federal law.

4. Purchaser expects to pay for Gas acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract solely from funds derived from its Electricity distribution operations. Purchaser expects to use current net revenues of its pay for current Gas acquisitions. There are no funds or accounts of Purchaser or any person who is a Related Person to Purchaser in which monies are invested and which are reasonably expected to be used to pay for Gas acquired more than one year after it is acquired. No portion of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used directly or indirectly to replace funds of Purchaser or any persons who are Related Persons to Purchaser that are or were intended to be used for the purpose for which the Bonds were issued.

5. The authorization, execution and delivery of the Supply Contract and compliance with the provisions thereof (a) will not conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under, (i) any instrument relating to the organization, existence or operation of Purchaser, (ii) any ruling, regulation, ordinance, judgment, order or decree to which Purchaser (or any of its officers in their respective capacities as such) is subject or (iii) any provision of the laws of the State relating to Purchaser and its affairs, and (b) to our knowledge will not result in, or require the creation or imposition of, any lien on any of the properties or revenues of Purchaser pursuant to any of the foregoing.

6. Purchaser is not in breach of or default under any applicable constitutional provision or any law or administrative regulation of the State or the United States or any applicable judgment or decree or, to our knowledge, any loan or other agreement, resolution, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument to which Purchaser is a party or to which Purchaser or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject, and to our knowledge no event has occurred and is continuing which with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default or event of default under any such instrument.

7. Payments to be made by Purchaser under the Supply Contract shall constitute operating expenses of Purchaser's utility system payable solely from the revenues and other available funds of Purchaser's utility system as a cost of purchased gas. The application of the revenues and other available funds of Purchaser's utility system to make such payments is not subject to any prior lien, encumbrance or other restriction.

8. As of the date of this opinion, to the best of our knowledge after due inquiry, there is no pending or threatened action or proceeding at law or in equity by any court, government agency, public board or body affecting or questioning the existence of Purchaser or the titles of its officers to their respective offices or affecting or questioning the legality, validity, or enforceability of this Supply Contract nor to our knowledge is there any basis therefor.

This opinion is rendered solely for the use and benefit of the addressees listed above in connection with the Supply Contract and may not be relied upon other than in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Supply Contract, or by any other person or entity for any purpose whatsoever, nor may this opinion be quoted in whole or in part or otherwise referred to in any document or delivered to any other person or entity, without the prior written consent of the undersigned.

The Operational Nomination shall be delivered electronically to the notice addresses set forth on Attachment 1.

4.1.2 The Delivery Scheduling Entity shall update appropriate nomination details on the relevant Receipt Scheduling Entity’s Operational Nomination and forward to all other Relevant Parties by the close of the Business Day prior to nominations leaving control of the nominating Scheduling Entity for the first timely nomination cycle for the Transporters at the Delivery Points for deliveries in each Month in which Gas is to be delivered.

4.1.3 The Delivery Scheduling Entity shall, if necessary due to reduction during any Month, update appropriate nomination details on the relevant Receipt Scheduling Entity’s Operational Nomination and forward to all other Relevant Parties by not later than 8:00 am CPT two Business Days prior to nominations leaving control of the nominating Scheduling Entity for the first timely nomination cycle for the Transporters at the Delivery Points for deliveries on any Day or Days in which Gas is to be delivered.

4.1.4 The Scheduling Entities acknowledge and understand that changes to Operational Nomination details may occur after the deadline set forth in Section 4.1.1. The Scheduling Entity initiating the change will forward a revised Operational Nomination to the other Scheduling Entity (with a copy to each other Relevant Party) and the other Scheduling Entity will exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to accommodate such change(s). The Relevant Parties will exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to limit the amount of changes and accommodate requested changes at all times as allowed in the Transporter’s tariff.

4.1.5 For any other proposed changes to an Operational Nomination, the Scheduling Entities may initially communicate orally or via other electronic means. However, such changes will be subsequently communicated as a revised Operational Nomination as outlined above as soon as reasonably possible.

4.2 Event-Specific Communications

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

**4.2.2** Each Scheduling Entity shall notify the other Relevant Parties as soon as practicable in the event of: (i) any deficiencies in scheduling related to such Scheduling Entity or such Scheduling Entity’s Transporter; (ii) any deficiencies in scheduling related to the other such Scheduling Entity or such other Scheduling Entity’s Transporter of which the notifying Scheduling Entity becomes aware; and (iii) any action taken by such Scheduling Entity’s Transporter that would reasonably be expected to create issues related to Gas flow under the Prepaid Agreement.

**5. ACCESS AND INFORMATION**

**5.1** The Relevant Parties agree to provide relevant records from Transporters and any other Relevant Transporters necessary to document and verify Gas flows within and after the Month as needed to facilitate settlement under the Gas Contracts.

**5.2** Each Relevant Party acknowledges that the Scheduling Entities may not have immediate access to Gas flow information at the Delivery Points. Therefore, the Scheduling Entities will closely monitor the available nomination information at the Delivery Points and promptly notify each other upon obtaining knowledge of any discrepancies in such nomination information and the quantities required to be delivered and taken under the applicable Gas Contracts at the Delivery Points. Each Relevant Party acknowledges and agrees that the inability of a Relevant Party to immediately access Gas flow information at the Delivery Points shall not impact or be construed as a waiver of any of the rights and obligations of the Relevant Parties set forth in the applicable Gas Contract.

**5.3** Each Scheduling Entity will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with J. Aron to ensure that J. Aron has sufficient agency rights from each such Scheduling Entity with respect to each Transporter to allow J. Aron to view Gas flows at the Delivery Points.

**6. NOTICES**  
Any notice, demand, request or other communication required or authorized by this Communications Protocol to be given by one Relevant Party to another Relevant Party shall be in writing, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. It shall be sent by facsimile (with receipt confirmed by telephone and electronic transmittal receipt), email, courier, or personally delivered (including overnight delivery service) to the applicable representative of the other Relevant Party designated in Attachment 1 hereto. A Relevant Party may change its representative identified in Attachment 1 hereto at any time by written notice to each other Relevant Party. Any notice, demand, or request shall be deemed to be given (i) when sent by facsimile confirmed by telephone and electronic transmittal receipt, (ii) when sent by email.

G-1-4
<!-- Page 1014 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

or (iii) when actually received if delivered by courier or personal delivery (including overnight delivery service). Each Relevant Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the other Relevant Parties, to change its address at any time, and to designate that copies of all such notices be directed to another Person at another address. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Relevant Party may at any time notify the others that any notice, demand, request or communication to it must be provided by email transmission for a specified period of time or until further notice, and any communications delivered by means other than email transmission during such time shall be ineffective.

7. NO IMPACT ON CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  
Except as expressly set forth herein or in an applicable Gas Contract, nothing in this Communications Protocol nor any Relevant Party’s actions or inactions hereunder shall have any impact on any Relevant Party’s rights or obligations under the Gas Contracts.

8. UPSTREAM SUPPLY CONTRACT  
8.1 J. Aron and Participant may designate a contract as an “Upstream Supply Contract” by entering into an Assignment Agreement (as defined below) and notifying the other Relevant Parties of the execution of such Assignment Agreement; provided that (i) any such Upstream Supply Contract must include this Communications Protocol, (ii) any Upstream Supplier thereunder must be contract-enabled with J. Aron; (iii) any Upstream Supplier thereunder must be able to satisfy J. Aron’s internal requirements that are necessary to “know your customer” rules, policies and procedures, anti-money laundering rules and regulations, Dodd-Frank Act, Commodity Exchange Act, PATRIOT Act and similar rules, regulations, requirements and corresponding policies; (iv) any Upstream Supply Contract must have a delivery period of a minimum of two years; (v) any such Upstream Supplier, Participant and J. Aron must enter into a Limited Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Attachment 4 (an “Assignment Agreement”); and (vi) an Affiliate of Participant may only act as an Upstream Supplier (a) to the extent that it is acting as a replacement supplier due to the early termination of an Upstream Supply Contract and (b) for the remaining term for deliveries under such terminated Upstream Supply Contract. An “Upstream Supplier” is the seller of Gas to J. Aron under any Upstream Supply Contract.

8.2 Not later than 180 days prior to the expiration of any Upstream Supply Contract or immediately upon the early termination of any Upstream Supply Contract, J. Aron and Participant will begin to cooperate in good faith and exercise commercially reasonable efforts to locate a replacement Upstream Supply Contract. J. Aron agrees that it will not unreasonably delay or withhold its consent to any Upstream Supply Contract proposed by Participant, provided that it shall not be unreasonable for J. Aron to withhold its consent if the proposed Upstream Supply Contract or Upstream Supplier thereunder (i) fails to satisfy the requirements set forth in Section 8.1 above or (ii) poses materially different risks to J. Aron or the other Relevant Parties (other than Participant) relative to the Upstream Supply Contract and Upstream Supplier that is being replaced (without regard to any adverse changes relating to the Upstream Supplier being replaced that arose after such).

8.3 If the Assigned Contract Price (as defined in any Assignment Agreement) is a fixed price, the Contract Quantity for each Gas Day under the Commodity Supply Contract (and the portion of the Contract Quantity associated therewith under the Prepaid Agreement and the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement) shall equal the (i) Contract Quantity for each Gas Day of the applicable Assignment Period (as defined in the relevant Assignment Agreement) multiplied by (ii) the result of (A) the relevant Assigned Contract Price, divided by (B) [NOTE: To list the result of the following formula as determined at pricing: Front End Fixed Price + (Active Swap Fee – Standby Swap Fee).]. For the avoidance of doubt, such updates to the Contract Quantities shall only apply for the relevant Assignment Period, and, in the event of an early termination of any such Assignment Period, such adjusted Contract Quantities shall be reversed effective as of the first day of the second Month following the Month in which such early termination occurs.

8.4 The declaration of “Force Majeure” by an Upstream Supplier under an Upstream Supply Contract shall be deemed Force Majeure for purposes of each of the Gas Contracts.

# EXHIBIT H
## ASSIGNMENT OF ASSIGNABLE CONTRACTS

1. **General Requirements.**

   1.1. During the Electricity Delivery Period, Assigned Rights and Obligations under a Assignable Contract may only be assigned under this Exhibit H if the following requirements are satisfied:

   1.1.1. The seller under such Assignable Contract (the “APC Party”) either (i) has a long-term senior unsecured credit rating that is “Baa3” or higher from Moody’s Investor’s Service, Inc. (or any successor to its credit rating service operation), “BBB-” or higher from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (or any successor to its credit rating service operation) or “A” or higher from Fitch Ratings, Inc. (or any successor to its credit rating service operation), (ii) provides alternative credit support that is reasonably satisfactory to J. Aron or (iii) otherwise provides evidence of its creditworthiness that is reasonably satisfactory to J. Aron;

   1.1.2. The APC Party can satisfy J. Aron’s internal requirements as they relate to “know your customer” rules, policies and procedures, anti-money laundering rules and regulations, Dodd-Frank Act, Commodity Exchange Act, Patriot Act and similar rules, regulations, requirements and corresponding policies;

   1.1.3. The APC Party is organized in the United States and in a jurisdiction that does not present material and adverse tax consequences to J. Aron or Issuer in connection with such proposed assignment, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Issuer shall have an obligation to reimburse J. Aron for any adverse tax consequences that are not material;

   1.1.4. The Applicable Project (as defined below) is reasonably expected to be able to generate the P99 Generation (as defined below), as agreed by Purchaser and J. Aron; provided that, if Purchaser and J. Aron are unable to reach agreement after good faith discussions, then J. Aron shall make such determination in its sole discretion.

   1.1.5. J. Aron, Purchaser, and Issuer have agreed on and executed an Assignment Schedule for such assignment;

   1.1.6. J. Aron, Purchaser, Issuer, and the applicable APC Party have agreed on and executed an Assignment Agreement for such assignment;

   1.1.7. Any such Assignable Contract must terminate on or before the end of the Electricity Delivery Period; and

H-1
<!-- Page 1048 -->
1.1.8. The contract price (in $/MWh) payable by Purchaser under the applicable Assignable Contract (the “APC Contract Price”) is a fixed price unless Issuer, Purchaser and J. Aron agree, each in their sole discretion, to appropriate changes to the relevant documents to accommodate a floating APC Contract Price. For purposes of this Exhibit H, a “fixed price” shall be deemed to include any price that is fixed but for a periodic escalation (whether pre-determined or by reference to a price index).

2. Proposed Assignment. Purchaser may propose an assignment under Article XV of the Commodity Supply Contract by delivering the following items to Issuer and to J. Aron:

2.1. A written notice of the proposed assignment signed by Purchaser;

2.2. A true and complete copy of the Assignable Contract under which such Assigned Rights and Obligations would arise;

2.3. Evidence reasonably satisfactory to Issuer and J. Aron that all authorizations, consents, approvals, licenses, rulings, permits, exemptions, variances, orders, judgments, decrees, declarations of or regulations by any Government Agency necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Assignable Contract and the assignment of the Assignable Contract to J. Aron have been obtained and are in full force and effect;

2.4. For any Assignable Contract to be assigned during the Electricity Delivery Period, a description and information regarding the applicable project to which the Assignable Contract applies (the “Applicable Project”), including but not limited to information on the location, interconnection(s), and operating history of Applicable Project;

2.5. For any Assignable Contract to be assigned during the Electricity Delivery Period, Purchaser shall deliver monthly historical generation and meteorological data of the Applicable Project dating back to the commercial operation date and, if readily available, a report from a nationally recognized consultant in the energy industry that is reasonably acceptable to Issuer and J. Aron showing the “P99” forecasted generation (“P99 Generation”); and

2.6. Such additional information as Issuer and J. Aron may reasonably request regarding the Assignable Contract and the APC Party.

Following Issuer’s and J. Aron’s receipt of such information, Purchaser and Issuer will, and Issuer will cause J. Aron to, (i) negotiate in good faith with one another regarding a potential Assignment Schedule, with the initial draft of such Assignment Schedule to be developed by J. Aron, and (ii) negotiate in good faith with one another and the APC Party regarding an Assignment Agreement, in each case related to the proposed assignment. If such Assignment Schedule and Assignment are agreed to by the representative parties thereto, the applicable parties will execute such Assignment Agreement and Assignment Schedule to be effective upon the assignment of the Assigned Rights and Obligations from Purchaser to J. Aron pursuant to the Assignment Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser acknowledges that J. Aron will not be required.

to execute any Assignment Agreement, Assignment Schedule, or otherwise accept any Assigned Rights and Obligations unless the APC Party (i) satisfies J. Aron’s internal requirements as they relate to “know your customer” rules, policies and procedures, anti-money laundering rules and regulations, Dodd-Frank Act, Commodity Exchange Act, Patriot Act and similar rules, regulations, requirements and corresponding policies, (ii) is organized in the United States, and (iii) satisfies all other requirements in Section 1 of this Exhibit H.

3. Assignment Schedule. In connection with each assignment, an “Assignment Schedule” will be prepared in the form attached hereto as Attachment 1 (with such changes as agreed by the Parties in their sole discretion), must be executed by Purchaser, Issuer and J. Aron, and must include each of the following:

3.1. The term of such Assigned Rights and Obligations (the “Assignment Period”) shall have the meaning specified in each applicable Assignment Agreement and shall (i) end not later than one (1) Month prior to the end of the current Reset Period, (ii) not commence any earlier than sixty (60) days after Purchaser’s original notice under Section 2.1 above, and (iii) have a primary term that does not exceed 12 Months in duration (provided, for the avoidance of doubt, the primary term references the term of the Assignment Period and not the term of a Assignable Contract). To the extent mutually agreed upon by all parties to the Assignment Schedule, the Assignment Period may include a month-to-month or annual renewal term that may be terminated upon written notice of termination 30 days prior to the end of any renewal term.

3.2. For any Assignable Contract to be assigned during the Electricity Delivery Period, a description of the Applicable Project or upstream supplier.

3.3. For any Assignable Contract to be assigned during the Electricity Delivery Period, the P99 Generation and P50 Generation of the Applicable Project and, if the Assigned Quantities that Purchaser wishes to include in the Assigned Rights and Obligations is less than the total P99 forecasted generation available from the Applicable Project, the Assigned Quantities as so limited. Purchaser and J. Aron shall in good faith attempt to agree upon the P99 Generation based on the information provided pursuant to Section 2.5 above; provided that, if Purchaser and J. Aron are unable to reach agreement, then J. Aron shall make such determination in its sole discretion.

3.4. The “Assigned Prepay Quantity” for each Month of the Assignment Period, which Assigned Prepay Quantity will be the lesser of (i) the P99 Generation of the Applicable Project for such Month, and (ii) the Assigned Quantities as described in Section 3.3 for such Month; provided that, in the case of clause (b), the Assigned Prepay Quantity for each Month may not exceed the limit expressed in the proviso to Section 3.5 below.

3.5. An updated Exhibit A to the Commodity Supply Contract reflecting a reduction in Hourly Quantity during the Assignment Period after giving effect to the Assignment Schedule (the “Reduced Hourly Quantity”), which Reduced Hourly
<!-- Page 1050 -->
Quantity for each Delivery Hour will equal (i) the Assigned Prepay Quantity for such Delivery Hour (which will be determined by dividing the Assigned Prepay Quantity for the applicable Month by the number of Delivery Hours in such Month), multiplied by (ii) the result of (A) the APC Contract Price applicable for such Month, divided by (B) S[____]/MWh while deliveries are to the Primary Electricity Delivery Point; provided that, in each case, if the Reduced Hourly Quantity for any Month would result in a Contract Quantity of less than zero (0), then the Assigned Prepay Quantity for such Month will be reduced to the closest whole MWh, such that the Contract Quantity is not reduced below zero (0).

3.6. The APC Contract Price, which as set forth in Section 1.7 above must be a fixed price unless Issuer, Purchaser and J. Aron agree to appropriate changes to the relevant documents to accommodate a floating APC Contract Price.

3.7. The Assigned Delivery Point for all Assigned Electricity.

3.8. The APC Contract Price must be inclusive of all Assigned Products. Assigned Products may not include (i) capacity or (ii) any other products that are separately delivered from Electricity (during the Electricity Delivery Period) other than RECs whose delivery may be accomplished through the delivery of a certificate or reporting to an applicable tracking agency.

6 NTD: This amount will be the result of the following formula as determined at pricing: Front End Fixed Price + (Active Swap Fee – Standby Swap Fee).

Aron and Company, LLC and [Buyer].**

This Limited Assignment Agreement (this “Assignment Agreement” or “Agreement”) is entered into as of [__], by and among [__], a [__] (“PPA Seller”), [Municipal Participant], a [__] (“PPA Buyer”), and J. Aron & Company LLC, a New York limited liability company (“J. Aron”), and relates to that certain power purchase agreement between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller as further described in Appendix 1 (the “PPA”). Unless the context otherwise specifies or requires, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the PPA.

In consideration of the premises above and the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, PPA Seller, PPA Buyer and J. Aron (the “Parties” hereto; each is a “Party”) agree as follows:

1. **Limited Assignment and Delegation.**

   (a) PPA Buyer hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to J. Aron all right, title and interest in and to the rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA to receive delivery of the products described in Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Products”) during the Assignment Period (as defined in Appendix 1), as such rights may be limited or further described in the “Further Information” section on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Product Rights”). All Assigned Products shall be delivered pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the Assignment Period as provided in Appendix 1. All other rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly reserved for PPA Buyer.

   (b) PPA Buyer hereby delegates to J. Aron the obligation to pay for all Assigned Products that are actually delivered to J. Aron pursuant to the Assigned Product Rights during the Assignment Period (the “Delivered Product Payment Obligation” and together with the Assigned Product Rights, collectively the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”); provided that (i) all other obligations of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly retained by PPA Buyer and PPA Buyer shall be solely responsible for any amounts due to PPA Seller that are not directly related to Assigned Products; and (ii) the Parties acknowledge and agree that PPA Seller will only be obligated to deliver a single consolidated invoice during the Assignment Period (with a copy to J. Aron).

(c) J. Aron hereby accepts and PPA Seller hereby consents and agrees to the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delegation described in clauses (a) and (b) above.

(d) All scheduling of Assigned Products and other communications related to the PPA shall take place pursuant to the terms of the PPA; provided that (i) title to Assigned Product will pass from PPA Seller to J. Aron upon delivery by PPA Seller of Assigned Product in accordance with the PPA; (ii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any Notice of a Force Majeure Event or Event of Default or default, breach or other occurrence that, if not cured within the applicable grace period, could result in an Event of Default contemporaneously upon delivery thereof to PPA Seller and promptly after receipt thereof from PPA Seller; (iii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any forecasts of Energy generation provided by PPA Seller under the PPA; (iv) PPA Seller will provide copies to J. Aron of all invoices and supporting data provided to PPA Buyer pursuant to Section [ ], provided that any payment adjustments or subsequent reconciliations occurring after the date that is 10 days prior to the payment due date for a monthly invoice, including pursuant to Section [ ], will be resolved solely between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller and therefore PPA Seller will not be obligated to deliver copies of any communications relating thereto to J. Aron; and (v) PPA Buyer and PPA Seller, as applicable, will provide copies to J. Aron of any other information reasonably requested by J. Aron relating to Assigned Products.

(e) PPA Seller acknowledges that (i) J.

Aron. To the extent any such PPA Buyer Receivables are transferred to J. Aron, J. Aron may transfer such PPA Buyer Receivables to PPA Seller and apply the face amount thereof as a reduction to any Delivered Product Payment Obligation. To effect such transfer, J. Aron shall deliver to PPA Seller a notice of intent to transfer PPA Buyer Receivables not later than the payment due date for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation and shall deliver to PPA Seller a bill of sale signed by J. Aron not later than five Business Days thereafter. Thereafter, PPA Seller shall be entitled to pursue collection on such PPA Buyer Receivables directly against PPA Buyer.

Aron within five (5) business days following receipt by J. Aron and PPA Buyer of written notice;

(3) delivery of a written notice by PPA Seller if any of the events described in the definition of [Bankrupt] in the PPA occurs with respect to J. Aron; or

(4) delivery of a written notice by J. Aron if any of the events described in the definition of [Bankrupt] [John: Some of the PPAs I just reviewed called this Bankruptcy Event, bracketing for future.] in the PPA occurs with respect to PPA Seller.

![Exhibit A](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Exhibit+A)

The Calculation Agent will undertake the following steps in determining the Available Discount Percentage for any Reset Period (each, a “New Reset Period”):

- **Step 1: Determine the “Prior Remaining Commodity Value”**
  - The Calculation Agent will determine the Remaining Commodity Value for the last month of the current Reset Period (the “Old Reset Period”) based on Attachment 1 hereto, as such Attachment 1 initially existed or was last updated at the beginning of the prior Reset Period (the “Prior Remaining Commodity Value”).
  - “Remaining Commodity Value” means, for any month, the amount set forth on Attachment 1 of the Exhibit A as the “Remaining Commodity Value” for such month, as Attachment 1 may be updated pursuant to this Exhibit A in connection with the establishment of any new Reset Period.

- **Step 2: The Calculation Agent will specify the length of the New Reset Period pursuant to Section 3 of the Agreement**

- **Step 3: The Calculation Agent will specify a Reset Period Implied Rate for the New Reset Period and a Delivery Period Implied Rate**
  - “Reset Period Implied Rate” means, for any Reset Period other than the Current Reset Period, a fixed rate offered by the Funding Recipient for such Reset Period as of the Bond Pricing Date for such Reset Period, which rate the Parties acknowledge (i) will be determined by Funding Recipient in its sole and absolute discretion based on the rate of Funding Recipient, and (ii) for which the Funding Recipient may consider all relevant factors, including (w) the nature of the source of funding provided by the Funding Agreement, including any applicable regulatory or capital charges, (x) the tenor, (y) market interest for such funding at the time, and (z) any other unique attributes of the Funding Agreement funding relative to other sources available to Funding Recipient. The Parties acknowledge that, for purposes of providing an Estimated Available Discount Percentage, the Calculation Agent may rely on indicative pricing proposals from a Qualified Funding Recipient.
  - “Delivery Period Implied Rate” means, for any remaining portion of the Delivery Period that is not covered by a Reset Period, a fixed rate determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole and absolute discretion as of the Bond Pricing Date for such Reset Period which the Calculation Agent determines (in its sole discretion) that Funding Recipient would be able to acquire, as of the date of determination, funding from other sources comparable to the funding provided by the Funding Agreement as of the date of determination if such Funding Agreement were extended for the entire Delivery Period. In determining such a rate, and the Calculation Agent may consider all relevant factors, including (w) the nature of the source of funding provided by the 

Exhibit A – Page 1
<!-- Page 1068 -->
![Funding Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Funding+Agreement)

**Funding Agreement**, including any applicable regulatory or capital charges, (x) the length of the Delivery Period, (y) market interest for such funding at the time, and (z) any other unique attributes of the Funding Agreement funding relative to other sources available to Funding Recipient.

- **Step 4: Determine the “New Remaining Delivery Cost”**
  - The Calculation Agent will determine the “Remaining Delivery Cost” for each month of the Delivery Period after the Old Reset Period. The Remaining Delivery Cost for the first month of the New Reset Period is the “New Remaining Delivery Cost”.
  - “Remaining Delivery Cost” means, for any determination month, an amount calculated by the Calculation Agent equal to the net present value of a stream of monthly payments equal to the Monthly Contract Quantities multiplied by the applicable Fixed Price (as defined in the Prepaid Agreement) for the remainder of the Delivery Period (including such determination month), Discount Percentage at the Reset Period Implied Rate for the New Reset Period and the Delivery Period Implied Rate for the remainder of the Delivery Period after the New Reset Period.

- **Step 5: Additional Reduction Amount or Changing Monthly Contract Quantities**
  - If the Prior Remaining Commodity Value is less than the New Remaining Delivery Cost:
    - If the Reset Period will go to the end of the Delivery Period, the Calculation Agent will reduce the Monthly Contract Quantities to zero in as many months as necessary at the end of the Delivery Period (and, to the extent necessary, reduce the Monthly Contract Quantities in the last remaining month of the Reset Period to a quantity greater than zero) such that the Prior Remaining Commodity Value is equal to the New Remaining Delivery Cost.
    - If the Reset Period will end prior to the Delivery Period, the Calculation Agent may reduce the Monthly Contract Quantities as provided above to the extent such reduction results in a greater Available Discount Percentage for such Reset Period.
  - If the Prior Remaining Commodity Value is greater than the New Remaining Delivery Cost:
    - Subject to the following bullet, the Calculation Agent will pay to the Issuer the amount, if any, by which (A) the Prior Remaining Commodity Value exceeds (B) the New Remaining Delivery Cost (the “Additional Reduction Amount”) on the first day of the contemplated Interest Rate Period, which payment shall be applied by the Issuer to the retirement of Bonds.
    - Notwithstanding the prior bullet, the Calculation Agent shall elect to retain a portion of the Excess Amount to the extent (i) the Reset Period will end prior to the Delivery Period, (ii) such retention results in a greater Available Discount Percentage, and (iii) doing so is.

<!-- Page 1069 -->
![Exhibit A – Page 3](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Exhibit+A+%E2%80%93+Page+3)

- consistent with the amortization requirement of the Bonds. If the Calculation Agent elects to retain a portion of such Excess Amount pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Additional Reduction Amount shall be the portion of such Excess Amount that the Calculation Agent elects to pay.
  - Any Additional Reduction Amount or changes in Monthly Contract Quantities will then be included in calculating the New Remaining Delivery Cost. An Additional Reduction Amount will reduce the Prior Remaining Commodity Value for this purpose.
  - The Calculation Agent will amend Attachment 1 hereto effective as of the beginning of the New Reset Period such that the Remaining Commodity Value for each month in the New Reset Period and the remainder of the Delivery Period is equal to the Remaining Delivery Cost for such month as determined under Step 4 and updated under this Step 5.

- **Step 6: Determine the Fixed Rate for the Bonds for the term of such contemplated Interest Rate Period**
  - The remarketing agent or underwriter of the Bonds for such contemplated Interest Rate Period will specify the Fixed Rate.
  - “Fixed Rate” means, for any New Reset Period, the fixed rate or rates of interest payable by the Issuer with respect to a Series of Bonds or, in the case of a Series of Variable Rate Bonds (as defined in the Bond Indenture), the fixed rate payable by the Issuer under the related fixed rate swap transaction, which Fixed Rates will be determined on the Bond Pricing Date at a rate sufficient to enable all the Bonds to be sold or remarketed on such Bond Pricing Date in accordance with the Bond Indenture (which sale price may include a premium or Discount Percentage to par), as determined based on market information then available.

- **Step 7: Determine Monthly Discount Percentage Portion of Available Discount Percentage**
  - The Calculation Agent will determine the Monthly Discount Percentage portion of the Available Discount Percentage for each portion of the Reset Period based on the expected differences between monthly revenues and monthly debt service and other obligations of the Commodity Project (as defined in the Bond Indenture).

- **Step 8: Determine Annual Refund Portion of Available Discount Percentage**
  - The Calculation Agent and Issuer shall mutually agree upon the projected Annual Refund (as defined in the Commodity Supply Contracts) for the Reset Period, which shall be determined consistent with the Commodity Supply Contracts and shall be the remaining portion of the Available Discount Percentage.

Section 7. SPE Custodian.

(a) The SPE Custodian shall have (i) no liability under any agreement other than this Custodial Agreement and (ii) no duty to inquire as to the provisions of any agreement other than this Custodial Agreement, the Funding Agreement, the Prepaid Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the J. Aron Subordinated Loans and the Back-End Commodity Swap; provided, however, that the SPE Custodian shall have no duties or responsibilities whatsoever except such duties and responsibilities as are specifically set forth in this Agreement. The SPE Custodian may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any written notice, document, instruction or request furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The SPE Custodian shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. The SPE Custodian shall have no duty to solicit any payments which may be due it. The SPE Custodian (in its capacity as SPE Custodian and Valuation Agent) shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the SPE Custodian’s gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of any loss to any party hereto. In connection with the execution of any of its powers or the performance of any of its duties hereunder, the SPE Custodian may consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled Persons selected and retained by it. The SPE Custodian shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or other skilled Persons, provided the SPE Custodian exercised due care and good faith in the selection of such Person. The permissive rights of the SPE Custodian to take actions enumerated under this Custodial Agreement shall not be construed as duties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Custodial Agreement, the Funding Agreement, the Prepaid Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the J. Aron Subordinated Loans and the Back-End Commodity Swap, the SPE Custodian shall not be required to exercise any rights or remedies under this Custodial Agreement or otherwise take any action or refrain from taking any action unless it shall have been directed to do so in a writing by Prepay LLC, Issuer or the Trustee which is authorized or permitted to be given under this Custodial Agreement. So long as the SPE Custodian has requested instructions from one or more of Prepay LLC, Issuer or the Trustee in a timely manner regarding a matter or determination for which such party has the right to provide instructions hereunder, the SPE Custodian shall not be liable for any delay in acting that is attributable to a delay or failure by Prepay LLC, Issuer or the Trustee in providing such instructions to the SPE Custodian, and the SPE Custodian shall be fully protected, and shall incur no liability whatsoever to Prepay LLC, Issuer, the Trustee, the Swap Counterparty or any other Person in connection with, in acting (or failing to act) pursuant to such instructions, provided that
<!-- Page 1091 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

such instructions (i) are reasonably believed to have been given by an Authorized Officer and (ii) are authorized or permitted to be given under this Custodial Agreement. In the event that the SPE Custodian shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Custodial Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise in writing by all of the other parties hereto or by a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The SPE Custodian may interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court of competent jurisdiction or may seek a declaratory judgment with respect to certain circumstances, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and all liability or obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets or any action or non-action based on such declaratory judgment. Anything in this Custodial Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the SPE Custodian be liable for special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages, losses or penalties of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), regardless of the form of action.

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the SPE Custodian is not a fiduciary by virtue of accepting and carrying out its obligations under this Custodial Agreement and has not accepted any fiduciary duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to its services hereunder. The SPE Custodian shall not be required to risk or expend its own funds in performing its obligations under this Custodial Agreement. If and to the extent that Prepay LLC instructs the SPE Custodian to settle transactions in the Prepay LLC Revenue Account, Prepay LLC (i) shall cause such transactions to be funded by depositing with the SPE Custodian sufficient immediately available funds (provided that this requirement shall be satisfied if sufficient funds are available in the Prepay LLC Capital Account for transfer to the Prepay LLC Revenue Account consistent with Section 5(d) of this Custodial Agreement), (ii) shall not rely on the SPE Custodian to extend credit in order to settle any such transaction, and (iii) acknowledges that any transactions not fully funded by Prepay LLC may fail to settle. Subject to the requirements of Section 5(d) of this Custodial Agreement, if the SPE Custodian, in its sole discretion, permits an overdraft in the Prepay LLC Revenue Account or if Prepay LLC is for any other reason indebted to the SPE Custodian, Prepay LLC shall immediately deliver for credit to the Prepay LLC Revenue Account sufficient cash to eliminate such debit balance, plus accrued interest at a rate then charged by the SPE Custodian to its institutional custody clients in the relevant currency, which rate shall be supplied by the SPE Custodian to Prepay LLC from time to time.

Section 8. Removal, Resignation and Succession.

(a) The SPE Custodian may be removed with 30 days’ prior written notice by Prepay LLC, with a copy to each of the other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such removal of the SPE Custodian shall not be effective until a successor SPE Custodian has been appointed pursuant to this Section 8. The SPE Custodian’s rights under this Custodial Agreement to indemnity and any amounts due and payable to the SPE Custodian shall survive any such removal.
<!-- Page 1092 -->
(b) The SPE Custodian may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving not less than 30 days’ advance notice in writing of such resignation to the other parties hereto specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect; and such resignation shall take effect upon the date specified in such notice unless a successor has not been appointed by the other parties to this Custodial Agreement on such date, in which event such resignation shall not take effect until a successor is appointed.

(c) In case at any time the SPE Custodian shall resign or shall be removed or shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or if a receiver, liquidator or conservator of the SPE Custodian, or of its property, shall be appointed, or if any public officer shall take charge or control of the SPE Custodian, or of its property or affairs, Prepay LLC, Issuer and J. Aron shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor custodian in a timely fashion, provided that any custodian appointed in succession to the SPE Custodian shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of any state or a national banking association and shall have capital stock, surplus and undivided earnings aggregating at least $50,000,000 and shall be a bank with trust powers or a trust company willing and able to accept the office on reasonable and customary terms and authorized by law to perform all the duties imposed upon it by this Custodial Agreement. Any corporation or association into which the SPE Custodian may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all of the SPE Custodian’s corporate trust line of business may be transferred, shall be the SPE Custodian under this Custodial Agreement without further act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no appointment of a successor SPE Custodian shall be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 8 within 30 days after (i) Prepay LLC has given notice to the SPE Custodian and the other parties hereto of the SPE Custodian’s removal as provided in this Section 8 or (ii) the SPE Custodian has given to the other parties hereto written notice of its resignation as provided in this Section 8, the SPE Custodian may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor SPE Custodian. Said court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as such court may deem proper, appoint a successor SPE Custodian.

**Section 9. Fees.** J. Aron, as the sole member of Prepay LLC, agrees to pay the SPE Custodian reasonable compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder, which compensation shall be $32,500.00 for each year that this Custodial Agreement is in effect and shall be invoiced annually. The initial fee shall be calculated on a pro rata basis and shall be invoiced on May 1, 2024, and thereafter, on May 1 of each subsequent year. J.

**Section 11. Taxpayer Identification Numbers; Tax Matters.**

Any tax returns or reports required to be prepared and filed in connection with the Prepay LLC Revenue Account and the Prepay LLC Capital Account will be prepared and filed by Prepay LLC and the SPE Custodian shall have no responsibility for the preparation and/or filing of any tax return with respect to any income earned on the Prepay LLC Revenue Account and the Prepay LLC Capital Account. In addition, any tax or other payments required to be made pursuant to such tax return or filing shall be paid by Prepay LLC.

Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Section 12, (i) in the case of communications delivered to the SPE Custodian pursuant to clause (b) or clause (c) of this Section 12 above, such communications shall be deemed to have been given on the date received by the SPE Custodian and (ii) in the case of the notifications required pursuant to Section 3(b), such notices may be given by e-mail to an e-mail address provided by the Funding Recipient to the SPE Custodian from time to time. In the event that the SPE Custodian, in its sole discretion, shall determine that an emergency exists, the SPE Custodian may use such other means of communication as the SPE Custodian deems appropriate.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Custodial Agreement to the contrary, the SPE Custodian shall have the right to accept and act upon instructions or directions provided by a party pursuant to this Custodial Agreement or by the Trustee, or any other document reasonably relating to the Bonds, if delivered using Electronic Means (as defined below); provided, however, that the applicable party shall provide to a Responsible Officer of the SPE Custodian an incumbency certificate listing designated individuals with the authority to provide such instructions (each an “Authorized Officer”) and containing specimen signatures of such Authorized Officers, which incumbency certificate shall be amended, with written notice to a Responsible Officer of the SPE Custodian, whenever an individual is to be added or deleted from the list.

the listing. If a party elects to give the SPE Custodian directions or instructions using Electronic Means and the SPE Custodian in its discretion elects to act upon such directions, the SPE Custodian’s understanding of such directions shall be deemed controlling. The party giving such instructions to the SPE Custodian understands and agrees that the SPE Custodian cannot determine the identity of the actual sender of such directions and that the SPE Custodian may conclusively presume that directions that purport to have been sent by an Authorized Officer listed on the incumbency certificate provided to a Responsible Officer of the SPE Custodian have been sent by such Authorized Officer. The party giving such instructions shall be solely responsible for ensuring that only Authorized Officers of such party transmit such directions to the SPE Custodian and that the party and all Authorized Officers treat applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys as confidential and with extreme care. The SPE Custodian shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from its reliance upon and compliance with such instructions notwithstanding that such instructions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction. The party giving such instructions to the SPE Custodian agrees: (i) to assume all risks arising out of the use of Electronic Means (as defined below) to submit directions to the SPE Custodian, including without limitation the risk of the SPE Custodian acting on unauthorized directions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties; (ii) that it is fully informed of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of transmitting directions to the SPE Custodian and that there may be more secure methods of transmitting directions; (iii) that the security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its transmission of directions provide to it a commercially reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and circumstances; (iv) to notify the SPE Custodian immediately upon learning of any compromise or unauthorized use of the security procedures; and (v) to indemnify and hold harmless the SPE Custodian against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred or sustained by the SPE Custodian as a result of or in connection with the SPE Custodian's reliance upon and compliance with instructions or directions given by Electronic Means (as defined below), except for any claim, damage or loss resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the SPE Custodian (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts due under clause (v) of this Section 12 above shall not duplicate any other amounts due under this Custodial Agreement, including without limitation amounts due under Section 10 or Section 17 hereof).  
As used herein, “Electronic Means” shall mean instructions sent by S.W.I.F.T, e-mail, facsimile and other similar secure electronic transmission platform containing applicable authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys issued by the SPE Custodian (“Secure Platform”) or another method or system specified by a Responsible Officer of the SPE Custodian as available for use in connection with the SPE Custodian’s services hereunder. Access to and use of the SPE Custodian’s systems shall be subject to the terms and conditions contained in a separate written agreement. Prepay LLC, J. Aron and the Issuer shall be responsible for requesting access to any such system of the SPE Custodian and completing the documentation required for such access and nothing herein shall obligate the SPE Custodian to ensure any such access and the SPE Custodian shall have no responsibility or liability should such parties fail to, or elect not to, avail itself of such access. If the parties elect to use an on-line communications system owned or operated by a third party, the SPE Custodian shall have no responsibility or liability for the reliability or availability of any such service.

## Valuation Services Terms and Conditions

1. On each Valuation Date, Valuation Agent shall determine the Delivery Amount and the Return Amount as herein described. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Support Annex to the Back-End Commodity Swap.

2. On the Business Day prior to each Valuation Date as set forth in the Credit Support Annex to the Back-End Commodity Swap, Prepay LLC shall provide the Exposure under the Back-End Commodity Swap to the Valuation Agent. The Valuation Agent shall calculate the Delivery Amount and the Return Amount consistent with the terms of the Credit Support Annex (i.e., the Exposure minus the Posted Collateral and the rounding and Minimum Transfer Amount specified in the Credit Support Annex). On each Valuation Date prior to the Notification Time specified in the Credit Support Annex to the Back-End Commodity Swap, Valuation Agent shall transmit to Prepay LLC and Swap Counterparty a report (“Report”) via e-mail of the values and other amounts determined in accordance with the preceding sentence. By electing to use e-mail for this purpose, Prepay LLC acknowledges that such transmissions are not encrypted and therefore are insecure. Prepay LLC further acknowledges that there are other risks inherent in communicating through the internet such as the possibility of virus contamination and disruptions in service, and agrees that Valuation Agent shall not be responsible for any loss, damage or expense suffered or incurred by any of the parties hereto or any other person claiming by or through the parties as a result of the use of such method.

3. Reports shall be produced on a basis and in such form and content as shall be mutually agreed between Valuation Agent and Prepay LLC. Prepay LLC shall examine (or cause to be examined) each Report and notify Valuation Agent of any error, omission or discrepancy by the close of business on the Business Day immediately following receipt of such Report. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that unless Valuation Agent is notified in writing of any error, omission or discrepancy by the close of the Business Day following receipt, each Report shall be deemed to be correct and conclusive in all respects, absent manifest error. In the event of any errors or omissions in any Report, Valuation Agent’s sole responsibility and liability shall be the preparation of a corrected Report at no additional cost.

4. Valuation Agent is authorized to utilize any generally recognized pricing or other information service providers reasonably believed by it to be reliable in order to perform its valuation and other responsibilities hereunder. The parties hereto understand and agree that certain pricing information with respect to complex financial instruments (e.g., derivatives) may be based on calculated amounts rather than actual market transactions and may not reflect actual market values, and that the variance between such calculated amounts and actual market values may or may not be material. Where pricing and other information service providers do not provide information for particular securities or other property, Prepay LLC may advise Valuation Agent regarding the fair market value of, or provide other information with respect to, such securities or property as determined by it in good faith. It is acknowledged and agreed that information supplied by such pricing or other information service providers may be incorrect or

incomplete and Valuation Agent shall not be liable for any loss, damage or expense incurred as a result of errors or omissions with respect to any pricing or other information utilized by Valuation Agent hereunder.

**DRAFT**  
**RATING: (SEE "RATING" HEREIN)**

See "TAX MATTERS" herein.

NCEA SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL OR REDEMPTION PRICE OF OR INTEREST ON THE BONDS, EXCEPT FROM THE FUNDS PROVIDED THEREUNDER UNDER THE INDENTURE AND NEITHER THE FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF, INCLUDING NCEA, OR OF THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT IS PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OR REDEMPTION PRICE OF ANY INTEREST ON THE BONDS.

The Bonds will bear interest at a fixed rate tied to the Interest Rate Reset Period.

2. **Prepayment:** In 2018, NCEA issued the 2018 Bonds to finance a prepayment to J. Aron & Company LLC ("J. Aron") for an approximately thirty-year supply of Commodities. Effective on the Initial Issue Date of the Bonds, J. Aron will transfer its interests under the 2018 prepayment transaction to Aron Energy Partners 33 LLC ("AEP33"). NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will enter into the Amended & Restated Prepaid Commodity Sales Agreement (the "Commodity Purchase Agreement"). Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, NCEA will pay for additional Commodity quantities and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to (a) deliver specified quantities of gas each month to NCEA during the Gas Delivery Period and specified hourly quantities of electricity during the Electricity Delivery Period; (b) make payments for any commodities not delivered on a fixed basis or the market price, whichever is higher; and (c) make a Termination Payment upon a Termination Payment Event, as described herein.

3. **Funding Agreement:** The Commodity Supplier and J. Aron (the "Funding Recipient"), will enter into a Agreement (the "Funding Agreement") pursuant to which the Commodity Supplier will loan/deposit a specified amount to the Funding Recipient and the Funding Recipient will be obligated to pay Scheduled Withdrawal Amounts to the Commodity Supplier and certain amounts upon any early termination of the Funding Agreement. The Scheduled Withdrawal Amounts payable under the Funding Agreement provide amounts sufficient to meet the Commodity Supplier's monthly Commodity purchase obligations, net of receipts (payments) under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap. The Funding Agreement provides a fixed interest rate for a term equal to the Interest Rate Reset Period on the Bonds and will mature at the end of such Period.

4. **Commodity Supply:** The Commodity Supplier will purchase Commodities from J. Aron under a long-term Commodity Sale and Service Agreement for a prescribed scheduled quantities and delivery points that matches the corresponding schedule under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Commodity Supplier will pay for the Commodities monthly in arrears. J.

5. **Project Participant:** Under the Commodity Supply Contract (which has been in effect since 2018), NCEA will sell to Sacramento Municipal Utility District all of the natural gas delivered by the Commodity Supplier during the Gas Delivery Period, and all of the electricity delivered in the Commodity Supplier during the Electricity Delivery period. In each case on a pay-as-you-go basis and that Contract provides respect to the Commodity Supply Contract which includes specified amounts. The amounts payable by the Project Participant will provide sufficient revenues to cover swap payments and receipts, and investment income from the Debt Service Account to NCEA to make the required scheduled deposits to the Debt Service Account.

6. **Commodity Swaps:** During the Gas Delivery Period, NCEA will pay and receive fixed amounts from the Commodity Swap Counterparty against the payment obligations per the contract which includes fixed revenues available to meet its fixed debt service obligations. The Commodity Supplier will enter into a mirror swap with the same Commodity Swap Counterparty to meet its requirements for market-referenced pricing to fulfill its delivery obligations.

**OFFICIAL STATEMENT**

**$000,000,000***  
**NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY**  
**COMMODITY SUPPLY REVENUE REFUNDING BONDS, SERIES 2024**

**INTRODUCTION**

This Official Statement, which includes the cover page and appendices attached hereto, contains information concerning (a) Northern California Energy Authority (“NCEA”), a joint powers authority organized under the laws of the State of California (the “State”), (b) NCEA’s Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”), being issued in the aggregate principal amount of $000,000,000* and (c) the Commodity Project (defined below) being financed with proceeds of the Bonds. Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings shown in APPENDIX C.

**NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY**

The Northern California Energy Authority (“NCEA”) is a joint powers authority formed pursuant to Chapter 5 of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code of the State of California, as amended and supplemented (the “Act”), by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority (“SFA”). NCEA is authorized to undertake all actions permitted by the Act that are necessary or convenient to assist SMUD with the acquisition and financing of supplies of natural gas and electricity, including undertaking the Commodity Project and selling the Commodity Project to SMUD, as described herein. See “NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY.”

**THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT**

SMUD operates the sixth largest community-owned electric utility system in the United States. SMUD’s electric system has provided retail electric service since 1946, and it currently serves a population of approximately 1.5 million persons in a 900 square mile service area that covers the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. See APPENDIX B for additional information regarding SMUD.

**THE COMMODITY PROJECT**

NCEA previously issued its Commodity Supply Revenue Bonds, Series 2018 (the “2018 Bonds”), pursuant to a Trust Indenture (the “2018 Indenture”) between NCEA and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, to finance the acquisition of an approximately thirty-year supply of natural gas and electricity (together, the “Commodities”) under a Prepaid Commodity Sales Agreement (the “2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement”) with J. Aron & Company LLC, a New York limited liability company (“J. Aron”). Deliveries of natural gas under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement began on June 1, 2019. NCEA entered

* Preliminary, subject to change.
<!-- Page 1117 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
**Commodity Supply Contract**  
into a Commodity Supply Contract (the “2018 Commodity Supply Contract”) with the Project Participant for the sale of all of the Commodities to be delivered under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement.  

The 2018 Bonds mature and are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on July 1, 2024, and a portion of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used to current refund the 2018 Bonds. See “PLAN OF REFUNDING.” Effective as of the Initial Issue Date of the Bonds: (a) J. Aron will transfer by novation of all its interests under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement and its other contracts and agreements related to the 2018 prepayment transaction to Aron Energy Prepay 33 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Commodity Supplier”); (b) in consideration of a lump sum payment for its acceptance of the obligations under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement and such other contracts and agreements, the Commodity Supplier will accept such transfer by novation from J. Aron; (c) NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will enter into an Amended & Restated Prepaid Commodity Sales Agreement (the “Commodity Purchase Agreement”), together with amendments and restatements of various other contracts and agreements entered into in connection with the 2018 prepayment transaction; (d) NCEA will make a prepayment to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement for additional quantities of Commodities to be delivered through September 2054; and (e) NCEA and the Project Participant will enter into an Amended & Restated Commodity Supply Contract (as so amended and restated, the “Commodity Supply Contract”) to provide for the purchase and sale of additional quantities of Commodities through September 2054.  

Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier will continue to deliver natural gas until NCEA exercises its option to switch from gas deliveries to electricity deliveries (the “Gas Delivery Period”). The switch from gas deliveries to electricity deliveries will occur on a date (the “Switch Date”) determined pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement, but may not occur prior to June 1, 2028. Scheduled deliveries of electricity under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will commence on the Switch Date and will continue to the end of the delivery period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (the “Electricity Delivery Period”). The “Commodity Project” consists of NCEA’s purchase of natural gas and electricity pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement and all of its related contractual arrangements and agreements. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT.”  

The Project Participant uses the natural gas that is now being delivered during the Gas Delivery Period as fuel for the generation of electricity that is distributed and sold to retail customers within its service area. If the Switch Date occurs, the Project Participant will distribute and sell the electricity that will be delivered during the Electricity Delivery Period to retail customers within its service area. See “THE COMMODITY SUPPLY CONTRACT.”  

**PLAN OF REFUNDING**  
Proceeds of the Bonds together with other available moneys will be deposited with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to an Escrow Agreement to establish an irrevocable trust escrow account (the “Escrow Account”), consisting of cash and noncallable direct full faith and credit obligations of the United States of America. The amounts in the Escrow Account will be used to refund the $537,295,000 principal amount of 2018 Bonds maturing on and after July 1, 2024 (the “Refunded Bonds”), and are pledged solely for the payment of the Refunded Bonds. Upon the deposit of such amounts and satisfaction of certain requirements of the 2018 Indenture, the Refunded Bonds will be deemed to be paid and will no longer be secured by the pledge of the Trust Estate under the 2018 Indenture. The Refunded Bonds will be called for redemption on July 1, 2024. See “PLAN OF REFUNDING” below.  
<!-- Page 1118 -->
# THE BONDS

From their Initial Issue Date to and including __________, 20__ (the “Interest Rate Reset Period”), the Bonds will bear interest in a Fixed Rate Period, with interest payable semiannually on each [January 1] and [July 1], commencing __________, 20__*, as described herein.

The Bonds are subject to optional redemption and extraordinary mandatory redemption during the Interest Rate Reset Period, and the Bonds maturing on __________, 20__* are required to be tendered for purchase on __________, 20__* (the “Mandatory Purchase Date”), which is the day following the end of the Interest Rate Reset Period. The Purchase Price of Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date is equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest. See “THE BONDS—Redemption” and “—Tender—Mandatory Tender.” Under the Indenture, a “Failed Remarketing” will occur upon the failure (a) of the Trustee to receive the Purchase Price of any Bond required to be purchased or redeemed on a Mandatory Purchase Date by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the fifth Business Day preceding such Mandatory Purchase Date or (b) to purchase or redeem such Bond in whole by such Mandatory Purchase Date. A Failed Remarketing will result in early termination of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the extraordinary redemption of the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date. See “THE BONDS—Redemption” and “—Tender.”

# SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

The Bonds are issued pursuant to the authority contained in the Act, and are issued and secured under an Amended and Restated Trust Indenture, dated as of the first day of the month in which the Bonds are issued (the “Indenture”), between NCEA and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association), as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Bonds are special and limited obligations of NCEA, are payable solely from and secured solely by the Trust Estate pledged by the Indenture, and are expected to be paid from the Revenues of the Commodity Project. See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS.”

# THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT

## Delivery of Commodities. 
Pursuant to the terms and conditions and subject to the limitations set forth in the Commodity Purchase Agreement:

(a) on each gas day during the Gas Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver and NCEA agrees to take, in each case on a firm basis, the Contract Quantity of gas;

(b) during each hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver and NCEA agrees to take, in each case on a firm basis, the Contract Quantity of electricity; and

(c) during each Month of the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver and NCEA agrees to purchase and take, the Assigned Prepay Quantity of electricity, if any.

“Contract Quantity” is defined in the Commodity Purchase Agreement to mean: (a) during the Gas Delivery Period for each gas day and each gas delivery point, the daily quantity of gas (in MMBtu) specified for such

* Preliminary, subject to change.
<!-- Page 1119 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

delivery point for the Month in which such gas day occurs: and (b) during the Electricity Delivery Period, (i) the specified Hourly Quantity of electricity for each hour and each electricity delivery point and (ii) the Assigned Prepay Quantity, if any, of Assigned Electricity for each Month. The delivery points designated in the Commodity Purchase Agreement are located on the natural gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines that serve the Project Participant.

**Switch Date.** On June 1, 2028 or such later date as may be established pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement (the “Switch Date”), deliveries of gas under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will cease, and the Electricity Delivery Period and deliveries of electricity will commence.

**Assigned Electricity.** From and after the Switch Date, the Project Participant may enter into assignment agreements (“PPA Assignment Agreements”) to assign a portion of its rights and obligations (the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”) under power purchase agreements (“Assigned PPAs”) to J. Aron. If such assignments are accepted by J. Aron, the electricity delivered under the Assigned PPAs (the “Assigned Electricity”) will be delivered to J. Aron for sale to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. The monthly quantities of Assigned Electricity that are allocated to the prepayment transaction pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Commodity Supply Contract (the “Assigned Prepay Quantities”) will offset (on an equivalent value basis), and will be used to meet, the Commodity Supplier’s obligations to deliver the Hourly Quantity of electricity to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. NCEA will then deliver such Assigned Prepaid Quantities to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract.

**Commodity Remarketing, Ledger Event and Additional Interest.** Under the circumstances described in the Commodity Purchase Agreement and during the Gas Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier agrees to remarket, on a daily or monthly basis, all or such portion of the Contract Quantity of gas as is designated by NCEA or the Trustee. In the event that the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket any such gas, the Commodity Supplier has agreed to purchase such gas for its own account. During the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier further agrees to remarket or purchase all or such portion of the Hourly Quantity of electricity as is designated by NCEA or the Trustee, and may agree to remarket Assigned Electricity upon mutual agreement with NCEA.

Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (described below), J. Aron has agreed to provide all Commodity marketing services necessary for the Commodity Supplier to meet its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. These services include requirements to (a) enter all remarketing sales or purchases of Commodities on a ledger system that tracks compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Treasury Regulations applicable to tax-exempt bonds that finance prepaid natural gas and electricity supplies, and (b) exercise commercially reasonable efforts to remediate any non-complying sales (i.e., non-qualified use sales and private business use sales) through “qualifying use” sales within two years.

In the event that any non-complying Commodities remarketing sales are not remediated within two years and exceed certain cumulative limits, a “Ledger Event” will occur, subject to certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If a Ledger Event occurs, and an Early Termination Payment Date has not been designated, J. Aron will be obligated to pay the Commodity Supplier, and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay NCEA, scheduled amounts (the “Ledger Event Payments”) calculated to provide a sum sufficient (together with the interest component of the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits) to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate of 8.00% per annum. The Indenture provides that, subject to NCEA’s receipt of such Ledger Event Payments from the Commodity Supplier, interest on the Bonds will be -4-
<!-- Page 1120 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

paid at the Increased Interest Rate after the occurrence of a Ledger Event. See “THE BONDS—Increased Interest Rate Upon Ledger Event,” “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing” and “—Ledger Event,” and “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT—J. Aron as Agent” and “—Ledger Event Payments.”

Commodity Delivery Termination Events. A Commodity Delivery Termination Date (a) will occur automatically under the Commodity Purchase Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events (“Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Events”), and (b) may be designated at the option of the Commodity Supplier upon the occurrence of a Ledger Event and certain other events (“Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Events”). Certain of these Commodity Delivery Termination Events also constitute Termination Payment Events under the Commodity Purchase Agreement as described below.

If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs, the Delivery Period for Commodities under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will end and the Commodity Supplier will be required:

(a) in the case of a Commodity Delivery Termination Event that is a Termination Payment Event, to pay a scheduled termination payment (the “Termination Payment”) to the Trustee on the last Business Day of the Month following the Month in which the Termination Payment Event or, in the case of a Termination Payment Event due to a Failed Remarketing, on the last Business Day of the then-current Interest Rate Period (in either case, the “Early Termination Payment”); or

(b) in the case of a Commodity Delivery Termination Event that is not a Termination Payment Event, to pay scheduled monthly amounts to NCEA until the earlier of (i) the Month in which a Termination Payment Event occurs or (ii) the last date for such scheduled payments.

Termination Payment Events. The Commodity Delivery Termination Events that constitute a Termination Payment Event are described under the caption “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Early Termination” below, and include: (a) a failure of the Commodity Supplier to pay any amounts owed to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement because of a failure by [__________] (the “Funding Recipient”) to pay when due any amounts owed to the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Funding Agreement (defined below) and such failure continues for 30 days after receipt by the Commodity Supplier and the Funding Recipient of notice thereof from NCEA; and (b) [exercise of Funding Recipient/Commodity Supplier Acceleration Option(s)].

If an Early Termination Payment Date occurs, the Bonds will be subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole on the first day of the following Month. The amount of the Termination Payment declines over time as the Commodity Supplier performs its Commodities delivery obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The amount of the Termination Payment, together with the amounts required to be on deposit in certain Funds and Accounts held by the Trustee, has been calculated to provide a sum at least sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of the Bonds, assuming that the Commodity Supplier, the Funding Recipient, the Investment Agreement Providers and the Project Participant pay and perform their respective contract obligations when due. A performance shortfall from any one of these entities could result in a payment shortfall to Bondholders.

If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs that is not a Termination Payment Event, an Early Termination Payment Date will not occur under the Commodity Purchase Agreement until the earlier of (a) the
<!-- Page 1121 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

occurrence of a Termination Payment Event or (b) the end of the Interest Rate Reset Period. In the event that the Funding Recipient does not exercise its option to prepay the Final Payment Amount, the scheduled monthly amounts required to be paid by the Commodity Supplier will be applied to make the debt service payments on the Bonds. The use of these scheduled payments (in lieu of payments made by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract) to make debt service payments could, under certain circumstances, adversely affect the continued tax-exempt status of the Bonds. See “INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS—Loss of Tax Exemption on the Bonds.”

See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT” and “THE BONDS—Redemption—Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption.” A schedule of the Termination Payment as of specified Early Termination Payment Dates under the Commodity Purchase Agreement during the Interest Rate Reset Period is attached as APPENDIX I.

THE FUNDING AGREEMENT

[to be revised/conformed]

The Commodity Supplier will use proceeds from the prepayment it receives from NCEA to purchase a Funding Agreement (the “Funding Agreement”) from the Funding Recipient. Such amount will be deposited into the “Funding Account” established under the Funding Agreement and will earn a fixed rate of interest. The Funding Agreement will mature by its terms on the Business Day preceding the Mandatory Purchase Date of the Bonds (the “Maturity Date”) unless terminated earlier. The Funding Agreement provides for monthly withdrawals of scheduled amounts (the “Scheduled Withdrawals”) from the Funding Account, including a final Scheduled Withdrawal of the unamortized balance of the Funding Account on the Maturity Date or any earlier termination date of the Funding Agreement. For a summary of certain provisions of the Funding Agreement, see “THE FUNDING AGREEMENT.” For certain information regarding [____], see APPENDIX J.

The monthly Scheduled Withdrawals provide amounts sufficient to enable the Commodity Supplier to meet its payment obligations (other than those in respect of the Receivables Purchase Provisions) under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap.

The ability of the Commodity Supplier to meet its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap will directly and materially depend upon full and timely performance by the Funding Recipient under the Funding Agreement. Any failure by the Funding Recipient to timely pay the Scheduled Withdrawals or the Final Payment Amount when due under the Funding Agreement will result in an inability of the Commodity Supplier to meet its contract obligations to NCEA and a shortfall in the amounts necessary for NCEA to pay the principal, interest, Redemption Price and purchase price due on the Bonds. The Funding Agreement is an unsecured obligation of the Funding Recipient. See “INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS—Performance by Others.”

THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT

Under a Commodity Purchase, Sale and Service Agreement (the “Commodity Sale and Service Agreement”) between J. Aron and the Commodity Supplier, J. Aron has agreed to sell Commodities to the
<!-- Page 1122 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

Commodity Supplier on a pay-as-you-go basis in the quantities and at the delivery points necessary to enable the Commodity Supplier to meet its commodity delivery obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. J. Aron is obligated to make payments to the Commodity Supplier for Commodities not delivered or taken under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement for any reason, including force majeure events. J. Aron has also agreed to remarket Commodities and make payments to the Commodity Supplier that enable it to meet its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. J. Aron is appointed as the Commodity Supplier’s agent for taking all actions that the Commodity Supplier is required or permitted to take under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Re-Pricing Agreement and, with respect to ordinary course transactions, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. J. Aron’s commodity delivery, payment, remarketing and receivables purchase obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement mirror the Commodity Supplier’s obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Commodity Supplier may net any amounts due and owing to it by J. Aron against its monthly payments to J. Aron, but J. Aron is not entitled to net any amounts due and owing to it against its monthly payments to the Commodity Supplier.

The payment obligations of J. Aron to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by GSG. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT.”

THE COMMODITY SUPPLY CONTRACT

Gas deliveries began under the 2018 Commodity Supply Contract on June 1, 2019. The Commodity Supply Contract provides for the sale to the Project Participant, on a pay-as-you-go basis, of all of the Commodities to be delivered to NCEA over the term of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. Under the Commodity Supply Contract, NCEA has agreed to deliver, and the Project Participant has agreed to purchase, the specified Contract Quantities of gas at designated delivery points during the Gas Delivery Period and the specified Hourly Quantities of electricity at designated delivery points during the Electricity Delivery Period. The Project Participant is obligated to pay NCEA for the quantities of Commodities delivered under the Commodity Supply Contract, including contracted quantities tendered for delivery by NCEA but not taken by the Project Participant (for which the Project Participant is eligible to receive a credit based on revenues received for the remarketed Commodities under certain circumstances described in such Commodity Supply Contract). The Project Participant has no obligation to pay for Commodities that NCEA fails to deliver. The Commodities sold under the Commodity Supply Contract are priced at the applicable “Contract Price,” which (a) in the case of the Contract Quantity of gas, is the applicable monthly market index price for the gas delivery point plus any applicable delivery point premium and (b) in the case of the Hourly Quantity of electricity, is the day-ahead market price for the electricity delivery point, in each case less a specified discount.

In addition to the provisions with respect to Assigned PPAs described above (see “The Commodity Purchase Agreement—Assigned Electricity”), the Commodity Supply Contract includes provisions that enable the Project Participant to enter into assignment agreements (“Gas Assignment Agreements”) to assign upstream gas supply contracts (“Upstream Supply Contracts”) to J. Aron during the Gas Delivery Period. If such assignments are accepted by J. Aron, the assigned quantities of gas (the “Assigned Gas Quantities”) under the Upstream Supply Contracts will be delivered to J. Aron for sale to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, and will be used to meet the Commodity Supplier’s obligations to deliver the Contract Quantity of gas to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and the Commodity Swaps contain various provisions and adjustments that accommodate the assignment of Upstream Supply Contracts and Assigned PPAs.
<!-- Page 1123 -->
![Payments made by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract are paid to NCEA for deposit into the Revenue Fund. The required payments under the Commodity Supply Contract, together with any net amounts received by NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap described below, constitute the primary and expected sources of the revenues pledged to the payment of the Bonds. The obligations of the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract are payable solely from the revenues of its electric system. Under the Commodity Supply Contract, the Project Participant makes payments directly to the Trustee for deposit into the Revenue Fund. See “THE COMMODITY SUPPLY CONTRACT.”]

# THE COMMODITY SWAPS

Upon the execution of the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement, NCEA and J. Aron entered into commodity price swap agreements with RBC Europe Limited (“RBCEL”), as commodity swap counterparty. Under these swap agreements and during the Gas Delivery Period under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement: (a) NCEA pays an index (floating) natural gas price and receives a fixed natural gas price for notional quantities of natural gas at delivery points that correspond to the quantities and related delivery points under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement; and (b) J. Aron pays a fixed natural gas price and receives a floating natural gas price at the same pricing points for the same notional quantities, also corresponding to the quantities and related delivery points under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement.

Effective as of the Initial Issue Date:

(a) NCEA’s 2018 swap agreement will be amended and restated to (i) replace RBCEL with Royal Bank of Canada (“Royal Bank”) as the Commodity Swap Counterparty (by novation), and (ii) include notional quantities of natural gas with respect to the additional quantities of gas to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement; (as so novated, amended and restated, the “NCEA Commodity Swap”);

(b) J. Aron will novate and transfer all of its interests under its 2018 swap agreement to the Commodity Supplier and such 2018 swap agreement will be amended and restated to (i) replace RBCEL with Royal Bank as the Commodity Swap Counterparty (by novation), and (ii) include notional quantities of natural gas with respect to the additional quantities of gas to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (as so novated, amended and restated, the “Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap”); and

(c) The Commodity Supplier will enter into a Custodial Agreement with the Commodity Swap Counterparty and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee and as custodian (in such capacity, the “Custodian”), to administer payments under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap. NCEA will enter into a Custodial Agreement (the “NCEA Custodial Agreement” and, together with the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement, the “Custodial Agreements”), with the Commodity Swap Counterparty, the Trustee and the Custodian, to administer payments under the NCEA Commodity Swap. See “THE COMMODITY SWAPS—Custodial Agreement.”

During the Gas Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement: (a) under the NCEA Commodity Swap, NCEA pays a floating price to Royal Bank and receives a fixed price from Royal Bank for notional quantities that correspond to the Contract Quantity of gas and pricing points under the Commodity Purchase Agreement; and (b) under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Supplier pays
<!-- Page 1124 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

a fixed price to Royal Bank and receives floating price from Royal Bank for the same notional quantities at the same pricing points. During the Electricity Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement: (a) under the NCEA Commodity Swap, NCEA pays a floating price based on the day-ahead market price of electricity to Royal Bank and receives a fixed price from Royal Bank for notional quantities that correspond to the Hourly Quantity of electricity and pricing points under the Commodity Purchase Agreement; and (b) under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Supplier pays a fixed price to Royal Bank and receives floating price from Royal Bank for the same notional quantities at the same pricing points. The notional quantities under the Commodity Swaps will be reduced to the extent of gas quantities delivered under fixed price Upstream Supply Contracts during the Gas Delivery Period and to the extent of electricity deliveries under fixed price Assigned PPAs during the Electricity Delivery Period.

The NCEA Commodity Swap and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (together, the “Commodity Swaps”) have rolling two-month terms that renew automatically upon the payment due date of each monthly net settlement amount due thereunder through the term of the Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, unless an early termination date occurs under the Commodity Swaps. Each of the Commodity Swaps is subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events as described herein, including upon a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY SWAPS” and “THE COMMODITY SWAP COUNTERPARTY.”

DEBT SERVICE AND COMMODITY SWAP RESERVES

The Indenture establishes funding requirements for various funds and accounts, including the Debt Service Account, the Debt Service Reserve Account and the Commodity Swap Reserve Account. Scheduled Debt Service Deposits are required to be made monthly into the Debt Service Account in amounts equal to the accrued debt service on the Bonds. It is expected that the Debt Service Account, the Debt Service Reserve Account and the Commodity Swap Reserve Account will be invested pursuant to the Investment Agreements described herein. The providers of the Investment Agreements (the “Investment Agreement Providers”) are required to meet certain qualifications specified in the Indenture and will be selected on the date of Bond pricing pursuant to a competitive bidding process. See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS—Investment of Funds.”

The Debt Service Reserve Account and the Commodity Swap Reserve Account provide reserves for debt service deposits and payments under the NCEA Commodity Swap in the event of payment defaults by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract. The Debt Service Reserve Requirement is $________, which approximately equals the maximum monthly Scheduled Debt Service Deposit during the Interest Rate Reset Period. The Minimum Amount required to be on deposit in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account is approximately $________. The Debt Service Reserve Requirement and the Minimum Amount are sufficient to cover payment defaults by the Project Participant for two months of maximum natural gas deliveries during the Interest Rate Reset Period at a monthly market gas index price of approximately $______/MMBtu*. The monthly market index prices of the gas for delivery under the Commodity Supply Contract in the month of [________] is $______/MMBtu.

![Receivables Purchase Provisions](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Receivables+Purchase+Provisions)

**RECEIVABLES PURCHASE PROVISIONS**

**Swap Call Receivables.** If a payment default by the Project Participant results in a deficiency of the funds necessary to pay amounts due under the NCEA Commodity Swap (a “Swap Payment Deficiency”), the Commodity Supplier has the option under the Receivables Purchase Provisions to purchase from the Trustee the rights to payment of net amounts owed by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract (“Swap Call Receivables”) in an amount sufficient to fund the Swap Payment Deficiency. The failure of the Commodity Supplier to exercise its option to purchase Swap Call Receivables is an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Receivables Purchase Provisions.”

**Elective Call Receivables.** If the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under its Commodity Supply Contract and such payment default does not result in a Swap Payment Deficiency, the Commodity Supplier has the option under the Receivables Purchase Provisions to purchase from the Trustee the receivables relating to such payment default (the “Elective Call Receivables” and, together with the Swap Call Receivables, “Call Receivables”). The Commodity Supplier may elect, in its discretion, to purchase the Elective Call Receivables at any time. The failure of the Commodity Supplier to not make such election does not constitute an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Receivables Purchase Provisions” herein.

**Purchase by J. Aron.** Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, J. Aron has agreed to purchase all Receivables purchased by the Commodity Supplier under the Receivables Purchase Provisions, provided that such obligation is subject to J. Aron having consented to the purchase of such Call Receivables by the Commodity Supplier. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT.”

**RE-PRICING PROVISION**

On the Initial Issue Date of the Bonds, NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will enter into an Amended and Restated Re-Pricing Agreement (the “Re-Pricing Agreement”), which provides for (a) the determination of Commodity delivery periods (“Reset Periods”) subsequent to the Reset Period that corresponds to the Interest Rate Reset Period on the Bonds and (b) the calculation of the amount of the discount (in cents per MMBtu or in dollars per MWh, as applicable) from the Contract Price of the Commodities that is available (the “Available Discount”) for sales of Commodities to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract during each Reset Period.

The Reset Period that corresponds to the Interest Rate Reset Period on the Bonds begins on __________ and ends on the last day of __________, and the next Reset Period is expected to begin on __________. In the event that the Available Discount for any Reset Period is less than the minimum discount specified in the Commodity Supply Contract (which includes both monthly discounts and any annual refunds), the Project Participant may elect not to take Commodities during the Reset Period and to have the Commodities remarketed for the duration of the Reset Period (a “Remarketing Election”) by giving notice of such election to NCEA. Any Commodity that is covered by a Remarketing Election will be remarketed in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event that the Project Participant makes a Remarketing Election with respect to such Reset Period, J. Aron will have the right, but not the obligation, to designate a CSSA Early Termination Date under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, which designation is a Termination Payment Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE RE-”

<!-- Page 1128 -->
# STRUCTURE OF THE COMMODITY PROJECT

The expected and intended source of the Revenues and other amounts to be used to pay the debt service on the Bonds are (a) the amounts payable by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, (b) any net amounts payable to NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap and (c) the principal amounts payable by the Investment Agreement Provider for the Debt Service Account. The Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract, the Investment Agreements, the Commodity Swaps, the Indenture, the Bonds and related agreements have been structured so that, assuming timely performance and payment by the Funding Recipient, GSG (as the guarantor of J. Aron’s payment obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement), the Investment Agreement Providers and the Project Participant of their respective contract obligations, the Revenues (defined herein) available to NCEA from the Commodity Project are calculated to be sufficient at all times to provide for the timely payment of the scheduled Debt Service requirements on the Bonds and the amounts due by NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap and the other Operating Expenses of the Commodity Project. These arrangements include:

- The Commodity Supplier is required to deliver Commodities under the Commodity Purchase Agreement in specified quantities at designated delivery points that correspond to the quantities of Commodities and delivery points that NCEA has committed to serve under the Commodity Supply Contract. In the event the Commodity Supplier fails to deliver the Commodities for any reason, including force majeure events, it is required to pay specified amounts to NCEA. In the event that the Assigned Gas Quantity or the Assigned Prepay Quantity is not delivered or taken under an Upstream Supply Contract or an Assigned PPA, NCEA is deemed to have requested that the Commodity Supplier remarket such assigned quantity, and the Commodity Supplier is required to pay specified amounts to NCEA.

- J. Aron is required to sell and deliver Commodities under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement in specified quantities at designated delivery points that correspond to the quantities of Commodities and the delivery points that the Commodity Supplier has committed to serve under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event J. Aron fails to deliver such Commodities for any reason, including force majeure events, it is required to pay certain specified amounts to the Commodity Supplier. The Commodity Supplier may not any amounts due and owing to it by J. Aron against its monthly payments to J. Aron, but J. Aron is not entitled to net any amounts due and owing to it against its monthly payments to the Commodity Supplier.

- The Scheduled Withdrawal Amounts required to be paid by the Funding Recipient under the Funding Agreement will provide the Commodity Supplier with amounts sufficient to make the payments it is required to make to J. Aron under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and any net amounts due to the Commodity Swap Counterparty under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap.

- The Project Participant has agreed to pay for Commodities tendered for delivery under the Commodity Supply Contract at the applicable Contract Price, and to pay specified damages to NCEA for a failure to accept Commodities tendered for delivery by NCEA, subject to the terms of the Commodity Supply Contract and the provisions with respect to a failure to take the Assigned Gas Quantity or the Assigned Prepay Quantity.

-13-
<!-- Page 1129 -->
- In the event that the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed under the Commodity Supply Contract (whether for Commodities taken or damages for Commodities tendered but not taken), NCEA has covenanted in the Indenture to exercise its right under the Commodity Supply Contract to suspend further deliveries of Commodities to the Project Participant.

- In the event of a suspension of Commodity deliveries, J. Aron will remarket such quantities of Commodities pursuant to the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement in compliance with the requirements of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Commodity Purchase Agreement requires specified payments for all Commodities remarketed or purchased, less certain applicable fees.

- In the event that any non-complying remarketing sales of Commodities are not remediated within two years and exceed certain cumulative limits, a Ledger Event will occur, subject to certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If a Ledger Event occurs, J. Aron will be obligated to pay the Commodity Supplier, and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay NCEA, scheduled Ledger Event Payments calculated to provide a sum sufficient (together with the interest component of the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits) to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate of 8.00% per annum. The Indenture provides that, subject to NCEA’s receipt of such Ledger Event Payments from the Commodity Supplier, interest on the Bonds will be paid at the Increased Interest Rate after the occurrence of a Ledger Event.

- If the Commodity Swap Counterparty does not make a required payment under the NCEA Commodity Swap and such payment remains unpaid after the expiration of any grace period, the Custodian under the terms of the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement will pay the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (or in the event of termination of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid into the custodial account as if the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap were still in effect), which such amount is held in custody, to NCEA, and such payment will be treated as a Commodity Swap Receipt for purposes of the Indenture.

- If the Commodity Swap Counterparty does not make a required payment under the NCEA Commodity Swap and such payment remains unpaid after the expiration of any grace period, the Custodian under the terms of the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement will pay the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (or in the event of termination of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid into the custodial account as if the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap were still in effect), which such amount is held in custody, to NCEA, and such payment will be treated as a Commodity Swap Receipt.

- If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay scheduled monthly amounts to NCEA in lieu of Commodity deliveries, which amounts are sufficient to enable NCEA to make the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits required by the Indenture.
<!-- Page 1130 -->
• If an [Event of Default] occurs under the Funding Agreement, the Funding Recipient is required to pay the [Final Payment Amount] to the Commodity Supplier.

• If a Termination Payment Event occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay the scheduled Termination Payment to the Trustee.

• The amounts required to be paid by the Investment Agreement Providers under the Investment Agreements will, together with the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits and the other amounts required to be deposited into the Debt Service Account, provide sufficient monies to NCEA to pay debt service.

**PERFORMANCE BY OTHERS**

The ability of NCEA to pay timely the scheduled debt service on the Bonds depends on the timely performance and payment by (a) the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, (b) the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract and (c) the Investment Agreement Providers under the Investment Agreements. The failure by any one or more of such parties to meet such obligations could materially and adversely affect the ability of NCEA to pay timely the scheduled debt service on the Bonds, and to meet its other obligations under the Indenture, the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract and the NCEA Commodity Swap.

The ability of the Commodity Supplier to meet its performance and payment obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and the Commodity Swap will depend directly and materially on timely payment by the Funding Recipient of the scheduled payments due under the Funding Agreement and on timely payment and performance by J. Aron of its obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. The failure by the Funding Recipient or J. Aron to meet such obligations would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Commodity Supplier to meet its contract obligations to NCEA and, in turn, the ability of NCEA to meet its contract obligations to the Project Participant. The failure by the Funding Recipient to meet such obligations would materially and adversely affect the ability of NCEA to pay timely the scheduled debt service on the Bonds.

The events and conditions that could result in a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds, include items that may be within or outside the control of NCEA or the Commodity Supplier (or both), such as:

• failure by the Funding Recipient to make timely payment of the scheduled amounts due under the Funding Agreement would result in an Early Termination Payment Event and a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds;

• failure by the Project Participant in the timely payment of the amounts due under the Commodity Supply Agreement could result in a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds if such non-payments exceed the amount on deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Account;

• failure by an Investment Agreement Provider to make timely payment of the required amounts due or payable under the Investment Agreements, including non-payment by the Project.
<!-- Page 1131 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Page)

Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, could result in a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds; and

- failure by the Commodity Swap Counterparty to make timely payment of the amounts due under the NCEA Commodity Swap coupled with a failure in the timely performance and enforcement of the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap could result in a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds.

The Commodity Purchase Agreement will terminate automatically upon the occurrence of a Termination Payment Event. If a Termination Payment Event occurs during the Initial Interest Rate Period (a) the Funding Recipient will be obligated to pay to the Commodity Supplier the final [Scheduled Withdrawal] due under the Funding Agreement, (b) the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay the scheduled Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date, and (c) the Bonds will be subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption.

The scheduled amount of the Termination Payment, together with the amounts required to be on deposit in certain Funds and Accounts held by the Trustee, has been calculated to provide NCEA with an amount at least sufficient to redeem all of the Bonds, assuming that the Commodity Supplier, the Funding Recipient and the Investment Agreement Providers pay and perform their respective contract obligations when due. If the Termination Payment becomes payable, the Bonds are to be redeemed at their Amortized Value, regardless of reinvestment rates at the time. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Early Termination” and “THE BONDS—Redemption—Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption.”

COMMODITY REMARKETING

If the Project Participant does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Commodities that it is obligated to purchase under the Commodity Supply Contract as a result of decreased gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period or decreased demand by the Project Participant’s retail customers or for other reasons permitting remarketing thereunder, it may request that NCEA arrange for the Commodity Supplier to remarket such Commodity. Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier has agreed, upon written notice from NCEA or the Trustee, to use commercially reasonable efforts to remarket or cause to be remarked on, a daily or monthly basis, such amounts of Commodities as are identified by NCEA, including Commodities that are covered by a Remarketing Election given by the Project Participant with respect to a Reset Period. In the event that the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket all or any portion of such Commodity, the Commodity Supplier will purchase the Commodity for its own account.

The Commodity Supplier has agreed to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remarket the Commodities to Municipal Utilities pursuant to provisions that are intended to maintain the tax-exempt status of interest on the Bonds (“Qualified Sales”), but, if the Commodity Supplier cannot do so, the Commodity Supplier is also permitted to remarket such Commodity to other governmental entities in non-private business sales (“Non-Private Business Sales”), although it is not required to remarket Commodities at a price that is less than the minimum remarketing price specified in the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket Commodity in Qualified Sales or Non-Private Business Sales, it must purchase the Commodity for its own account (a private business use sale). Under certain circumstances and upon reaching certain thresholds that are not timely remediated, the remarketing of Commodities to entities other than

-16-
<!-- Page 1132 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

Municipal Utilities and the purchase of Commodities by the Commodity Supplier could result in a Ledger Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

The Commodity Supplier will depend upon performance by J. Aron under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to meet its commodity remarketing obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, including particularly the ability of J. Aron to remarket Commodities in Qualified Sales to Municipal Utilities and to remediate any non-complying sales in order avoid the occurrence of a Ledger Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event that any non-complying remarketing sales of Commodities are not remediated within two years and exceed certain cumulative limits, a Ledger Event will occur, subject to certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

The occurrence of a Ledger Event [provides the Commodity Supplier with the option to designate a Commodity Delivery Termination Date, and provides the Funding Recipient with the option to exercise the Funding Recipient Acceleration Option which, if exercised, would result in a Termination Payment Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and a mandatory redemption of the Bonds. If a Ledger Event occurs, and J. Aron does not exercise the [________] Acceleration Option, J. Aron will be obligated to pay the Commodity Supplier, and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay NCEA, scheduled Ledger Event Payments calculated to provide a sum sufficient to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate of 8.00% per annum. The Indenture provides that, subject to NCEA’s receipt of such Ledger Event Payments from the Commodity Supplier, interest on the Bonds will be paid at the Increased Interest Rate after the occurrence of a Ledger Event. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing” and “—Ledger Event Payments,” and “THE BONDS—Increased Interest Rate Upon Ledger Event.” 

The Commodity Project will deliver an average of [____] million MMBtu of natural gas each year to the Project Participant during the Gas Delivery Period [and is expected to deliver [____] MWh of electricity each year to the Project Participant during the Electricity Delivery Period]. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodities Remarketing.”

LIMITATIONS ON EXERCISE OF REMEDIES

The remedies available to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement are limited to those described herein. NCEA has no rights to enforce the provisions of the Funding Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement or the related CSSA Guaranty (defined below) provided to the Commodity Supplier. Neither the Trustee nor the Bondholders have any rights to enforce the Funding Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement or the CSSA Guaranty. See “GSG, J. ARON AND THE COMMODITY SUPPLIER—The Commodity Supplier—Organization” for a description of certain consent and voting rights of the director appointed by NCEA to the Commodity Supplier’s board of directors and related covenants of NCEA.

The remedies available to the Trustee, NCEA and the Holders of the Bonds upon an Event of Default under the Indenture are in many respects dependent upon judicial actions which are often subject to discretion and delay. Under existing constitutional and statutory provisions and judicial decisions, the remedies provided in the Indenture may not be readily available or may be limited.

-17-
<!-- Page 1133 -->
![ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTS](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=ENFORCEABILITY+OF+CONTRACTS)

**ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTS**

The enforceability of the various legal agreements relating to the Commodity Project may be limited by bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors or secured parties generally and by the exercise of judicial discretion in accordance with general principles of equity and by principles of equity, public policy and commercial reasonableness. The Commodity Purchase Agreement and other agreements relating to the Commodity Project are executory contracts. If NCEA or the Funding Recipient, the Commodity Supplier, J. Aron, GSG, the Commodity Swap Counterparty, the Investment Agreement Provider, the Project Participant or any of the parties with which NCEA has contracted under such agreements (including the Commodity Purchase Agreement) is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, the relevant agreement could be discharged in return for a claim for damages against the party’s estate with uncertain value. In particular, an insolvency event with respect to the Funding Recipient that results in a delay or a reduction in the payments due under the Funding Agreement will result in insufficient amounts being available for the payment of the Bonds, whether on a Bond Payment Date, the Mandatory Tender Date or any extraordinary mandatory redemption date. In the event that NCEA is involved in an insolvency proceeding, the exercise of the remedies afforded to the Trustee under the Indenture may be stayed, and the availability of the Revenues necessary for the payment of the Bonds could be materially and adversely affected.

**NO ESTABLISHED TRADING MARKET**

The Bonds constitute a new issue with no established trading market. The Bonds have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance upon exemptions contained therein. The Underwriter has informed NCEA that it currently intends to make a market in the Bonds, the Underwriter is not obligated to do so and may discontinue any such market making at any time without notice. There can be no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Bonds. If an active public market does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Bonds may be adversely affected.

**LOSS OF TAX EXEMPTION**

As described below, the opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to the exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or the courts, and is not a guarantee of a result.

The Indenture, NCEA’s Tax Agreement with respect to the Bonds, the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Supply Contract contain various covenants and agreements on the part of NCEA, the Commodity Supplier and the Project Participant that are intended to establish and maintain the tax-exempt status of the interest on the Bonds. NCEA, the Commodity Supplier and the Project Participant have each agreed to abide by the various covenants and agreements designed to protect the tax-exempt status of the Bonds. A failure by NCEA, the Commodity Supplier and the Project Participant to comply with such covenants and agreements could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the tax-exempt status of the Bonds.

The IRS has an ongoing program of auditing tax-exempt obligations to determine whether, in the view of the IRS, interest on such tax-exempt obligations is includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. It cannot be predicted whether or not the IRS will commence an audit of the Bonds.

-18-
<!-- Page 1134 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

If an audit is commenced, under current procedures the IRS may treat NCEA as a taxpayer and the Bondholders may have no right to participate in such procedure. The commencement of an audit could adversely affect the market value and liquidity of the Bonds until the audit is concluded, regardless of the ultimate outcome.

Any loss of the tax-exempt status of the Bonds could be retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds and could cause all of the interest on the Bonds to be includable in gross income for purposes of federal income taxation. The loss of the tax-exempt status of the Bonds is not a termination event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and will not result in a mandatory redemption of the Bonds. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Ledger Event” and “TAX MATTERS.”

# SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

## THE INDENTURE

The Bonds are limited obligations of NCEA payable solely from and secured solely by a pledge of and lien on the “Trust Estate,” which is defined in the Indenture as follows: (a) the proceeds of the sale of the Bonds, (b) all right, title and interest of NCEA in, to and under the Commodity Supply Contract, (c) the Revenues, (d) any Termination Payment or the right to receive such Termination Payment (subject to the Collateral Agency Agreement), (e) all right, title and interest of NCEA in, to and under the Receivables Purchase Provisions, including payments received from the Commodity Supplier pursuant thereto, (f) all right, title and interest of NCEA in, to and under each Interest Rate Swap and the Interest Rate Swap Receipts, and the Pledged Funds (but excluding Rebate Payments held in any Fund or Account), including the investment income, if any, therefrom. The pledge of and lien on the Trust Estate under the Indenture is subject to (x) the provisions of the Indenture permitting the application thereof for the purposes and on the terms and conditions set forth therein, including the use of the Revenues to pay first, Rebate Payments then due and payable, second, the Commodity Swap Payments then due and payable and third, the other Operating Expenses of the Commodity Project, and (y) a prior lien on and security interest in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account and the amounts and investments on deposit therein in favor of the Commodity Swap Counterparty. Any Additional Termination Payment and the right to receive any Additional Termination Payment that is payable under the Commodity Purchase Agreement is not pledged as part of the Trust Estate.

The term “Revenues” is defined in the Indenture as follows: (a) all revenues, income, rents, user fees or charges, and receipts derived or to be derived by NCEA from or attributable or relating to the ownership and operation of the Commodity Project, including all revenues attributable or relating to the Commodity Project or to the payment of the costs thereof received or to be received by NCEA under the Commodity Supply Contract and the Commodity Purchase Agreement or otherwise payable to the Trustee (for the account of NCEA) for the sale and/or transportation of natural gas or electricity or otherwise with respect to the Commodity Project, (b) interest received or to be received on any moneys or securities (other than moneys or securities held in the Acquisition Account, moneys or securities held in the Redemption Account in the Debt Service Fund, or that portion of moneys in the Operating Fund required for Rebate Payments) held pursuant to the Indenture and paid or required to be paid into the Revenue Fund, and (c) any Commodity Swap Receipts received by the Trustee (on behalf of NCEA). The term “Revenues” does not include (r) any Termination Payment or any Additional Termination Payment paid pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (s) amounts required to be deposited into the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund in accordance with the Indenture, (t) Ledger Event Payments received from the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (u) any

assignment payment received from the Commodity Supplier, (v) any Interest Rate Swap Receipts, (iv) any Supply Administration Fee, (x) payments received from the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Exhibit; (y) any Investment Agreement Breakage Amount payable to NCEA; and (z) any Seller Swap MTM Payment payable to NCEA. The Revenues are to be applied in accordance with the priorities established under the Indenture, including the prior payment from the Revenues of the Operating Expenses of the Commodity Project. See “— Flow of Funds” below.

The term “Operating Expenses” is defined in the Indenture to mean, to the extent properly allocable to the Commodity Project: (a) NCEA’s expenses for operation of the Commodity Project, including all Rebate Payments; Commodity Swap Payments; costs, collateral deposits and other amounts (other than Commodity Swap Payments) necessary to maintain the NCEA Commodity Swap; and payments required under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (which may, under certain circumstances, include imbalance charges and other miscalculation payments) or required to be incurred under or in connection with the performance of NCEA’s obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract; and (b) any other current expenses or obligations required to be paid by NCEA under the provisions of the Indenture (other than Debt Service on the Bonds) or by law or required to be incurred under or in connection with the performance of NCEA’s obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract; provided that, Operating Expenses shall not include any amounts owed by NCEA under the Commodity Supply Contract with respect to purchases of replacement commodities by the Project Participant; (c) fees payable by NCEA with respect to any Remarketing Agreement for the Bonds; (d) the fees and expenses of the Fiduciaries; (e) reasonable accounting, legal and other professional fees and expenses incurred by NCEA, including but not limited to those relating to the administration of the Trust Estate and compliance by NCEA with its continuing disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to the Bonds; (f) the costs of any insurance premiums incurred by NCEA, including, without limitation, directors and officers liability insurance; and (g) fees of rating agencies necessary to maintain ratings on the Bonds. Litigation judgments and settlements and indemnification payments in connection with the payment of any litigation judgment or settlement and Extraordinary Expenses are not Operating Expenses.

THE BONDS DO NOT CONSTITUTE A DEBT OR LIABILITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF (INCLUDING THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT), OTHER THAN NCEA, BUT SHALL BE PAYABLE SOLELY FROM THE FUNDS PROVIDED THEREFOR UNDER THE INDENTURE. NCEA SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL OR REDEMPTION PRICE OF OR INTEREST ON THE BONDS, EXCEPT FROM THE FUNDS PROVIDED THEREFOR UNDER THE INDENTURE AND NEITHER THE FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF, INCLUDING NCEA, OR OF THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT IS PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OR REDEMPTION PRICE OF AND INTEREST ON THE BONDS. THE ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS SHALL NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OR CONTINGENTLY OBLIGATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF (INCLUDING THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT) TO LEVY OR TO PLEDGE ANY FORM OF TAXATION OR TO MAKE ANY APPROPRIATION FOR THEIR PAYMENT. NCEA HAS NO TAXING POWER.

THE OBLIGATION OF THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO NCEA UNDER THE COMMODITY SUPPLY CONTRACT IS NOT, NOR SHALL IT BE CONSTRUED AS, A GUARANTY OR ENDORSEMENT OF OR A SURETY FOR, THE BONDS. SUCH OBLIGATION OF THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT IS NOT A GENERAL OBLIGATION OF THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT, AND IS PAYABLE SOLELY FROM THE REVENUES DERIVED FROM THE OPERATION OF ITS ELECTRIC SYSTEM. THE INDENTURE DOES NOT MORTGAGE THE COMMODITY PROJECT OR ANY TANGIBLE PROPERTIES OR ASSETS OF NCEA OR THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT.

See APPENDIX C for the meanings of certain defined terms, and see APPENDIX D for a further description of certain provisions of the Indenture.

**FLOW OF FUNDS**

All Revenues are required by the Indenture to be deposited upon receipt thereof to the credit of the Revenue Fund. Moneys must be disbursed from the Revenue Fund monthly, on or before the days and to the extent and in the manner and order set forth below:

1. First, into the Operating Fund, not later than the 25th day of such Month, the amount, if any, required so that the balance therein shall equal the amount estimated to be necessary for the payment of Commodity Swap Payments coming due for such Month and other Operating Expenses coming due for the following Month (but no such payments or expenses for any prior Month); provided that, in the event that the amount on deposit in the Operating Fund is not sufficient to pay the Commodity Swap Payments due in any Month, the amount available therein shall be applied to the payment of the amounts due under the NCEA Commodity Swap in effect;

2. Second, into the Debt Service Fund, not later than the last Business Day of such Month for the credit to the Debt Service Account an amount equal to the greater of (A) the Scheduled Debt Service Deposit, as set forth in Schedule II to the Indenture, or (B) the amount necessary to cause the cumulative Scheduled Debt Service Deposits to be on deposit therein (without credit for undisbursed Interest Rate Swap Receipts on deposit therein);

3. Third, into the Commodity Swap Reserve Account in the Project Fund, not later than the last Business Day of such Month, the amount, if any, required so that the balance in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account is at least equal to the Minimum Amount;

4. Fourth, into the Debt Service Fund, not later than the last Business Day of such Month, for deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Account, the amount, if any, required so that the balance in such Debt Service Reserve Account shall equal the Debt Service Reserve Requirement related thereto as of the last day of the then current Month; and

5. Fifth, to the Commodity Supplier, not later than the last Business Day of such Month, the amount, if any, required for the repurchase of Call Receivables and the payment of interest on all Call Receivables sold to the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Provisions.

If, after the scheduled monthly deposit to the Debt Service Account, the balance therein is below the cumulative Scheduled Debt Service Deposits for such month as specified in the Indenture, the Trustee shall (a) promptly notify NCEA of such deficiency and if the Project Participant is in default under the Commodity Supply Contract and NCEA has not previously done so, cause NCEA to suspend all deliveries of all quantities of natural gas or electricity to the Project Participant, and (b) promptly give notice to the Commodity Supplier to follow the provision set forth in the remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

On each [_____] 1, 20[__], after making such transfers, credits and deposits as described in the first paragraph of this section “Flow of Funds,” and after the applicable Principal Installment payment date, the Trustee shall credit to the General Fund the remaining balance in the Revenue Fund. See

-21-
<!-- Page 1137 -->
“Revenues and Revenue Fund; Deposits of Other Amounts” and “Payments from Revenue Fund” in APPENDIX D.

As noted above, certain amounts are pledged as part of the Trust Estate but do not constitute Revenues and are not deposited into the Revenue Fund, including (a) any Termination Payment received under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, which is to be deposited directly into the Redemption Account of the Debt Service Fund, (b) any Assignment Payment shall be deposited directly into the Assignment Payment Fund, (c) amounts received from the Commodity Supplier under the Receivables Purchase Provisions shall be deposited by the Trustee into the Commodity Swap Reserve Account as provided in the Indenture, (d) any Interest Rate Swap Receipts shall be deposited directly into the Debt Service Account, (e) any Seller Swap MTM Payment shall be deposited into the Swap Termination Account and applied as provided in the Indenture, (f) any amounts to be deposited into the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund shall be deposited directly therein, (g) any Additional Termination Payment shall be paid to, or upon Written Instructions provided by, NCEA, (h) Ledger Amount Payments received from the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement shall be deposited directly into the Debt Service Account, (i) any Investment Agreement Breakage Amount payable to NCEA shall be deposited into the Investment Agreement Breakage Account, and [j] amounts received from the Project Participant in respect of the Supply Administration Fee shall be remitted to NCEA.]

DEBT SERVICE ACCOUNT

The Indenture establishes a Debt Service Account, which is held by the Trustee. The amounts deposited into the Debt Service Account, including capitalized interest deposited on the Initial Issue Date, must be held in such Account and applied to the payment of Debt Service payable on the Bonds on each Bond Payment Date when due and to the payment of the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on Bonds to be redeemed on each redemption date. Amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Account will be invested pursuant to the Investment Agreement, which will permit scheduled withdrawals to pay debt service on the Bonds and, in the case of extraordinary redemption, to pay the Redemption Price without penalty or market value adjustments.

DEBT SERVICE RESERVE ACCOUNT

The Indenture establishes a Debt Service Reserve Account which is held by the Trustee. Amounts in the Debt Service Reserve Account must be applied only to (a) make the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits to the Debt Service Account when the Revenues and other available amounts are insufficient or (b) redeem or defease Bonds.

The Debt Service Reserve Requirement is $_________*, which approximately equals 200% of the maximum monthly Scheduled Debt Service Deposit to be made to the Debt Service Account during the Interest Rate Reset Period from the amounts payable by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract. On the date of issuance of the Bonds, NCEA will deposit an amount equal to the Debt Service Reserve Requirement into the Debt Service Reserve Account, which amount will be invested pursuant to the Investment Agreement. See “ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS” above. See also “—Investment Agreement” below.

* Preliminary, subject to change.

<!-- Page 1138 -->
# REDEMPTION ACCOUNT

The Indenture establishes a Redemption Account, which is held by the Trustee. On any Early Termination Payment Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier is directed to pay the Termination Payment directly to the Trustee for the account of NCEA into the Redemption Account. The Trustee will deposit the Termination Payment into the Redemption Account and will apply such amounts to the payment of the Redemption Price of the Bonds as described below under “THE BONDS—Redemption—Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption.”

## COMMODITY SWAP RESERVE ACCOUNT

The Indenture establishes a Commodity Swap Reserve Account in the Project Fund, which is held by the Trustee. NCEA will deposit in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account a portion of the proceeds in an amount equal to $ * (the “Minimum Amount”), which shall be paid from time to time by the Trustee solely to the payment of Commodity Swap Payments in the event the amounts on deposit in the Operating Fund are not sufficient to make such payments; provided, however, that (a) in the event that the amount on deposit in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account is not sufficient to pay the Commodity Swap Payments due in any Month, the amount available in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account shall be applied pro rata to the payment of the amounts due under the Commodity Swaps then in effect, (b) any amounts in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account in excess of the Minimum Amount shall be transferred to the Revenue Fund and (c) any amounts remaining on deposit in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account on the final date for payment of the principal of the Bonds, whether upon maturity, redemption or otherwise, shall be applied to make such payment. The amount deposited in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account will be invested pursuant to the Investment Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Receivables Purchase Provisions—Call Option” and “—Investment of Funds” below.

## NO ADDITIONAL BONDS

Other than the Bonds and any refunding bonds, no additional bonds may be issued under the Indenture.

## AMENDMENT OF INDENTURE

NCEA and the Trustee may, subject to the conditions and restrictions in the Indenture, enter into a Supplemental Indenture or Indentures without the consent of the Bondholders for certain purposes and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. See “Supplemental Indenture Not Requiring Consent of Bondholders,” “General Provisions” and “Powers of Amendment” in APPENDIX D hereto.

## INVESTMENT OF FUNDS

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, amounts on deposit in the Funds and Accounts may be invested in, among other things, guaranteed investment contracts, forward delivery agreements or similar agreements that provide for a specified rate of return over a specified time period with providers (or their guarantors) rated at the time the investment is made at least at the same credit rating level as the Funding Recipient. See APPENDIX C—DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN TERMS and “Investment of Certain Funds” in APPENDIX D.

<!-- Page 1140 -->
NCEA has further covenanted that it will not consent or agree to or permit any termination or rescission of, any assignment or novation (in whole or in part) by the Project Participant of, or any amendment to, or otherwise take any action under or in connection with, a Commodity Supply Contract that will impair the ability of NCEA to comply during the current or any future year with the collection of fees and charges pursuant to the Indenture without a Rating Confirmation. Under the Indenture, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including delivery of a Rating Confirmation, NCEA may amend a Commodity Supply Contract or assign all or a portion of the Project Participant’s rights and obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract.

**Commodity Remarketing.** In the event that the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed to NCEA under a Commodity Supply Contract, NCEA shall promptly give notice to the Commodity Supplier to follow the provisions set forth in the Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement for each Month of such suspension with respect to the quantities of Commodities for which deliveries have been suspended.

**Trustee as Agent.** Under the Indenture, NCEA has appointed, authorized and directed the Trustee as its agent, subject to the terms of the Indenture, to issue notices and to take any other actions that NCEA is required or permitted to take under (a) the Commodity Supply Contract, (b) the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (c) the Receivables Purchase Provisions, and (d) the NCEA Commodity Swap. NCEA has retained, in the absence of any conflicting action by the Trustee, the right to exercise any rights for which it has appointed the Trustee as its agent as described in the preceding sentence; provided, however, if an Event of Default has occurred, the Trustee will have the right to notify NCEA to cease exercising such rights, and upon NCEA’s receipt of such notice, the Trustee will have exclusive authority to exercise such rights.

**Commodity Purchase Agreement.** NCEA has covenanted in the Indenture that it will enforce the provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and that it will duly perform its covenants and agreements under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

The Trustee will promptly notify NCEA upon becoming aware of any payment default that has occurred and is continuing on the part of the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. NCEA will provide the Trustee with Written Notice of the Early Termination Payment Date (a) by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the fifth Business Day preceding a Mandatory Purchase Date if an amount equal to the Purchase Price of the Bonds that are subject to such Mandatory Purchase Date has not been deposited with the Trustee and (b) in all other cases, not more than five days after such date is determined.

NCEA has further covenanted that it will not consent or agree to or permit any rescission or assignment of or amendment to or otherwise take any action under or in connection with the Commodity Purchase Agreement which would in any manner materially impair or materially adversely affect its rights thereunder or the rights or security of the Bondholders under the Indenture; provided, that the Commodity Purchase Agreement may be assigned or amended without Bondholder consent upon receipt of a Rating Confirmation.

**NCEA Commodity Swap.** Amounts due to NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap are payable directly to the Trustee for deposit into the Revenue Fund. The following restrictions apply to the replacement or termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap: 

-25-
<!-- Page 1141 -->
(a) NCEA agrees that it will not exercise any right to declare an early termination date under the NCEA Commodity Swap unless either (i) it has entered into a replacement NCEA Commodity Swap in accordance with the provisions described below, and such replacement NCEA Commodity Swap will be effective as of such early termination date and cover price exposure from and after such early termination date, or (ii) a “Commodity Delivery Termination Date” has occurred or has been designated under (and as such term is defined in) the Commodity Purchase Agreement prior to or as of such early termination date.

(b) NCEA may replace the NCEA Commodity Swap (and any related guaranty of a Commodity Swap Counterparty’s obligations thereunder) with a similar agreement for the same hedging purposes with an alternate Commodity Swap Counterparty at any time upon delivery to the Trustee of a Rating Confirmation.

(c) If the NCEA Commodity Swap is subject to termination or is terminated by either party in accordance with its terms, then (i) NCEA may, subject to clause (a) above, terminate such NCEA Commodity Swap if NCEA has the right to do so, and (ii) (A) NCEA may replace such NCEA Commodity Swap by exercising its right to increase its notional quantities under another NCEA Commodity Swap with another Commodity Swap Counterparty if such NCEA Commodity Swap is in effect and is not subject to termination, or (B) if NCEA cannot increase its notional quantities as described in clause (A) or if NCEA desires to enter into a new NCEA Commodity Swap in order to reduce its notional quantities under the NCEA Commodity Swap to their level previous following an increase of such notional quantities under clause (A), NCEA may enter into a replacement Commodity Swap with an alternate Commodity Swap Counterparty without Rating Confirmation, but only if the replacement NCEA Commodity Swap is identical in all material respects to the existing NCEA Commodity Swap, except for the identity of the Commodity Swap Counterparty, and (1) the replacement Commodity Swap Counterparty (or its credit support provider under such NCEA Commodity Swap) is then rated at least the lower of (a) the Minimum Rating or (b) the rating then assigned by each Rating Agency to the Bonds, or (2) such Commodity Swap Counterparty provides such collateral and security arrangements as NCEA shall determine to be necessary, and (3) in either case, such replacement Commodity Swap Counterparty enters into a replacement Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement with the Commodity Supplier and the Custodian that is identical in all material respects to the existing Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement for the Commodity Swap being replaced.

(d) If the NCEA Commodity Swap is not otherwise replaced but the Commodity Supplier is obligated under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement to continue paying Commodity Swap Receipts in the same amount that would have applied under such NCEA Commodity Swap, then such NCEA Commodity Swap will be deemed to be replaced by such obligation under such Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement and such obligation under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement will be treated as the NCEA Commodity Swap thereafter until such terminated NCEA Commodity Swap is otherwise replaced by another NCEA Commodity Swap.

Upon the occurrence of a Commodity Swap Replacement Event (defined below), NCEA agrees in the Indenture that it shall notify the Commodity Supplier of such event pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and in accordance with the Commodity Purchase Agreement, either (a) replace the affected NCEA Commodity Swap by exercising its right to increase its notional quantities under an NCEA Commodity Swap.

**ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS**

The sources and uses of funds in connection with the issuance of the Bonds are approximately as follows:

**SOURCES:**
- Par Amount: $ 
- Original Issue Premium: $ 
- Available Moneys¹: $ 

**Total Sources: $**

**USES:**
- Escrow Account: $ 
- Project Fund²: $ 
- Debt Service Reserve Account: $ 
- Commodity Swap Reserve Account: $ 
- Costs of Issuance³: $ 

**Total Uses: $**

---

**PLAN OF REFUNDING**

Proceeds of the Bonds together with other available moneys will be deposited with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to an Escrow Agreement to establish an irrevocable trust escrow account (the “Escrow Account”), consisting of cash and noncallable direct full faith and credit obligations of the United States of America. The amounts in the Escrow Account will be used to refund the $537,295,000 principal amount of 2018 Bonds maturing on and after July 1, 2024 (the “Refunded Bonds”), and are pledged solely for the payment of the Refunded Bonds.

The investments held in the Escrow Account will bear interest and mature in amounts that are, together with the uninvested cash held in the Escrow Account, sufficient to pay the principal and redemption price of and the interest due on the Refunded Bonds on each interest payment date and on the redemption date of the Refunded Bonds. On the Initial Issue Date, NCEA will irrevocably instruct the Escrow Agent, as trustee for the Refunded Bonds, to call the Refunded Bonds maturing on July 1, 2049 for redemption on July 1, 2024. Upon the deposit of such cash and investments and satisfaction of the requirements of the 2018 Indenture, the Refunded Bonds will be deemed to be paid and will no longer be secured by the pledge of the trust estate under the 2018 Indenture.

Registrar in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Bond and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time NCEA shall deposit with the Paying Agent an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to and approved in writing by the Paying Agent for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as provided in the Indenture. The Bond Registrar will then fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which will be not more than 15 days or less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Bond Registrar of written notice of the proposed payment. The Bond Registrar shall promptly notify NCEA of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of NCEA, will cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Bondholder at its address as it appears upon the registry books, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.

Aron will be obligated to pay the Commodity Supplier, and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay NCEA, scheduled Ledger Event Payments calculated to provide a sum sufficient (together with the interest component of the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits) to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate of 8.00% per annum. The Indenture provides that, subject to NCEA’s receipt of such Ledger Event Payments from the Commodity Supplier, interest on the Bonds will be paid at the Increased Interest Rate from and including the day on which a Ledger Event occurs but not including the earlier of (a) the date on which a Termination Payment Event occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (b) the Mandatory Purchase Date or any prior redemption date or (c) the Interest Payment Date immediately succeeding the last date on which the Commodity Supplier paid the Ledger Event Payments. Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, any Ledger Event would occur on and as of the first day of a Month.

See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Ledger Event” below for a description of the provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement relating to a Ledger Event and the amounts payable by the Commodity Supplier to NCEA following a Ledger Event. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT—Ledger Event Payments” below for a description of the provisions of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement relating to the amounts payable by J. Aron to the Commodity Supplier following a Ledger Event.

Interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate will be payable on each regular Interest Payment Date, any redemption date and the Mandatory Purchase Date. NCEA will give prompt notice to the Trustee of the occurrence of a Ledger Event and whether the Increased Interest Rate becomes payable on the Bonds. Interest on the Bonds at an Increased Interest Rate will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and will be payable in the same manner as the interest borne by the Bonds on the Initial Issue Date.

For purposes of the Indenture:

(a) any Ledger Event Payments received by NCEA from the Commodity Supplier in respect of a Ledger Event shall not constitute an item of “Revenues” and shall be deposited directly into the Debt Service Account; and

<!-- Page 1145 -->
(b) The Scheduled Debt Service Deposits required by the Indenture shall be computed on the basis of the interest rates borne by the Bonds on the Initial Issue Date and shall not be re-computed in the event that the Bonds bear interest at an Increased Interest Rate.

TENDER

Mandatory Tender. The Bonds maturing on ________, 20__ are required to be tendered for purchase on ________, 20__ (the "Mandatory Purchase Date"), which is the day following the end of the Interest Rate Reset Period. The Purchase Price of the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date is equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof and is payable in immediately available funds first from amounts on deposit in the Remarketing Proceeds Account established by the Indenture and second from amounts on deposit in the NCEA Purchase Account established by the Indenture. Accrued interest due on the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date, which is an Interest Payment Date, shall be paid from amounts in the Debt Service Account.

The Purchase Price of each Bond on the Mandatory Purchase Date shall be payable only upon surrender of such Bond to the Trustee at its designated corporate trust office, accompanied by an instrument of transfer thereof in form satisfactory to the Trustee, executed in blank by the Owner thereof or by the Owner’s duly authorized attorney, with such signature guaranteed by a commercial bank, trust company or member firm of the New York Stock Exchange at or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date specified for such delivery in a notice provided to the Owners by the Trustee, such notice to be given no less than 30 days prior to the Mandatory Purchase Date. In the event that any Owner of a Bond so subject to mandatory tender for purchase shall not surrender such Bond for the Purchase Price on the Mandatory Purchase Date, then such Bond shall be deemed to be an Undelivered Bond, and that no interest shall accrue thereon on and after such Mandatory Purchase Date and that the Owner thereof shall have no rights under the Indenture other than to receive payment of the Purchase Price thereof.

Failed Remarketing. Under the Indenture, "Failed Remarketing" means the failure (i) of the Trustee to receive the Purchase Price of any Bond required to be purchased on a Mandatory Purchase Date by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the fifth Business Day preceding such Mandatory Purchase Date or (ii) to purchase or redeem such Bond in whole by such Mandatory Purchase Date (including from any funds on deposit in the Assignment Payment Fund and required to be used for such redemption). A Failed Remarketing is a Termination Payment Event, and will result in an Early Termination Payment Date, under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and the extraordinary redemption of the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date. Such an extraordinary redemption of the Bonds has the same economic effect on Bondholders as a mandatory tender of the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date.

No Optional Tender. The Bonds of are not subject to optional tender by Bondholders during the Interest Rate Reset Period.

REDEMPTION

Optional Redemption. The Bonds are subject to redemption at the option of NCEA in whole or in part (in such amounts and by such maturities as may be specified by NCEA and by lot within a maturity) on any date preceding the first Business Day of the third month preceding the Mandatory Purchase Date at a Redemption Price, calculated by a quotation agent selected by NCEA, equal to the greater of:

-30-
<!-- Page 1146 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

(a) the sum of the present values of the remaining unpaid payments of principal and interest to be paid on the Bonds to be redeemed from and including the date of redemption (not including any portion of the interest accrued and unpaid as of the redemption date) to the earlier of (i) the stated maturity date(s) of such Bonds or (ii) the Mandatory Purchase Date, discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at a discount rate equal to the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate (as defined in APPENDIX C) for such Bonds minus 0.25% per annum, and

(b) the Amortized Value thereof (described below);

in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption at the Fixed Rate or an Increased Interest Rate, whichever is then in effect.

The Bonds maturing on and after the Mandatory Purchase Date are also subject to redemption at the option of NCEA in whole or in part on and after the first Business Day of the third month preceding the Mandatory Purchase Date at a Redemption Price, calculated by a quotation agent selected by NCEA, equal to the Amortized Value thereof as of the date of redemption, plus $0[_] per $1,000 of the principal amount thereof and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption; provided that, if the redemption date of the Bonds is on the Mandatory Purchase Date, the Redemption Price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In lieu of redeeming Bonds pursuant to this provision, NCEA may direct the Trustee to purchase such Bonds at a Purchase Price equal to the Redemption Price described above. Any Bonds so purchased may be remarketed in a new Interest Rate Period.

“Amortized Value” means, with respect to any Bond to be redeemed during the Interest Rate Reset Period, the principal amount of such Bond multiplied by the price of such Bond expressed as a percentage, calculated by a major market maker in municipal securities, as the quotation agent, selected by NCEA, based on the industry standard method of calculating bond prices (as such industry standard prevails on the date of delivery of the Bonds), with a delivery date equal to the date of redemption, a maturity date equal to the earlier of (a) the stated maturity date of such Bond, or (b) the Fixed Rate Tender Date of such Bond and a yield equal to such Bond’s original reoffering yield (as set forth on the inside cover page of this Official Statement). The Amortized Value of the Bonds as of certain dates during the Interest Rate Reset Period is shown on APPENDIX H.

Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption. The Bonds are subject to mandatory redemption prior to maturity in whole and not in part on the first day of the month following the Early Termination Payment Date (which will be the same day as the Mandatory Purchase Date in the event a Failed Remarketing has occurred) at a Redemption Price equal to the Amortized Value thereof, plus accrued interest to the redemption date.

See APPENDIX H for a schedule showing the Redemption Price (excluding accrued interest) of all of the Bonds upon an extraordinary mandatory redemption following an Early Termination Payment Date that occurs during the Interest Rate Reset Period.

NCEA shall provide the Trustee with Written Notice of the Early Termination Payment Date (x) by noon New York City time on the fifth Business Day preceding a Mandatory Purchase Date if an amount equal to the Purchase Price of the Bonds that are subject to such Mandatory Purchase Date has not been deposited with the Trustee, and (y) in all other cases, not more than five days after such date is determined.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

With respect to any notice of optional redemption of Bonds, unless upon the giving of such notice such Bonds will be deemed to have been paid under the Indenture, such notice must state that such redemption will be conditioned upon the receipt by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and interest on the Bonds to be redeemed, and that if such money shall not have been so received said notice will be of no force and effect, and NCEA will not be required to redeem such Bonds. In the event that such notice of redemption contains such a condition and such money is not so received, the redemption will not be made and the Trustee must within a reasonable time thereafter give notice, in the manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such money was not received and that such redemption was not made.

**Effect of Redemption.** On any redemption date, the Redemption Price of each Bond to be redeemed, together with the accrued interest thereon to such date, will become due and payable, and from and after such date, notice having been given and moneys available solely for such redemption being on deposit with the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture governing redemption of such Bonds, then, notwithstanding that any Bonds called for redemption may not have been surrendered, no further interest will accrue on any of such Bonds. From and after such date of redemption (such notice having been given and moneys available solely for such redemption being on deposit with the Trustee), the Bonds to be redeemed will not be deemed to be Outstanding under the Indenture.

**Partial Redemption of Bonds.** If less than all of the Bonds of like maturity and Series are called for redemption, such Bonds or portions of Bonds must be redeemed in increments of Authorized Denominations, and such increments to be called for redemption must be selected by lot in such manner as the Trustee determines (subject to the rules and procedures of DTC, as the Securities Depository). Upon surrender of any Bond called for redemption in part only, NCEA must execute, and the Trustee must authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, a new Bond or Bonds of Authorized Denominations and the same series and maturity in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Bond surrendered.

**BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM**

The Bonds will be initially issued in book-entry only form through the facilities of DTC. The Bonds will be transferable and exchangeable as set forth in the Indenture and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds. So long as Cede & Co. is the registered owner of the Bonds, principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds are payable by wire transfer by the Trustee to Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, which, in turn, will remit such amounts to DTC participants for subsequent disbursement to the Beneficial Owners. See APPENDIX G—“BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.”

**THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement relating to (i) the purchase and sale of natural gas during the Gas Delivery Period and (ii) the purchase and sale of electricity during the Electricity Delivery Period, if any. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and accordingly is qualified by reference to the full text thereof.

**PURCHASE AND SALE**

Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver specified daily quantities of natural gas each month during the Gas Delivery Period at a fixed price, and NCEA has agreed to make a lump sum advance payment to the Commodity Supplier for all of the cost of the gas to be delivered during the Gas Delivery Period (as well as the electricity to be delivered during the Electricity Delivery Period). The total quantity of gas to be delivered by the Commodity Supplier during the Gas Delivery Period is expected to be approximately [__] million MMBtu.

On the Switch Date, deliveries of gas under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will cease, and deliveries of electricity will commence. NCEA may elect to have the Switch Date occur any time on or after June 1, 2028.

-34-
<!-- Page 1150 -->
# DELIVERY OF GAS

During the Gas Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier is required to deliver fixed, pre-determined quantities of gas at the primary delivery point specified in the Commodity Purchase Agreement or to an alternate delivery point mutually agreed to by the Commodity Supplier, NCEA and the Project Participant. The Contract Quantity of gas required to be delivered on each day during the term of the Gas Delivery Period matches the Contract Quantity of gas that NCEA has agreed to deliver to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract. The approximate aggregate monthly quantities of gas to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement during the Gas Delivery Period range from a high of approximately 1.1 million MMBtu of gas in some months to no gas in other months.

# DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY

During each hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier is required to deliver fixed Hourly Quantities of electricity at the primary delivery point or one of the secondary delivery points specified in the Commodity Purchase Agreement or to an alternate delivery point mutually agreed to by the Commodity Supplier, NCEA and the Project Participant. The Hourly Quantity of electricity required to be delivered on each day during the term of the Electricity Delivery Period matches the Hourly Quantity of electricity that NCEA has agreed to deliver to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract.

As of the beginning of the Electricity Delivery Period, the Project Participant may assign one or more Assigned PPAs to J. Aron pursuant to PPA Assignment Agreements. During each month that an Assigned PPA is in effect, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver and NCEA agrees to take the Assigned Prepay Quantity of Assigned Electricity. Delivery, scheduling and transmission of Assigned Electricity, and title to and risk of loss of Assigned Electricity will be as provided in the applicable Assigned PPA and the applicable Assignment Agreement.

The Assigned Prepay Quantity is generally the “P99” output of the generating project that supplies an Assigned PPA or such lesser amount as may be determined pursuant to the provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract. If the quantity of Assigned Electricity that is delivered under an Assigned PPA exceeds the Assigned Prepay Quantity in any month (such excess being referred to as the “Assigned PAYGO Amount”), NCEA will pay the Commodity Supplier an amount equal to the quantity of the Assigned PAYGO Amount multiplied by the contract price under the Assigned PPA. If the quantity of Assigned Electricity that is delivered under an Assigned PPA is less than the Assigned Prepay Quantity in any month for any reason other than force majeure, NCEA will be deemed to have requested the Commodity Supplier to remarket the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered. The Commodity Supplier will sell such portion in a private business use sale will pay NCEA the product of (a) the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered and (b) the Contract Specified Price minus the applicable Remarketing Fee. All such sales made by the Commodity Supplier will be entered on the private business sales ledger that is maintained pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “Commodity Remarketing” below.

# PPA Payment Custodial Agreement

The Project Participant, J. Aron, the Commodity Supplier, NCEA and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as custodian (in such capacity, the “Custodian”) have entered into a custodial agreement (the “PPA Payment Custodial Agreement”) to administer payments to be received by the sellers of Assigned Electricity pursuant to the Assigned PPAs (the “PPA Sellers”). The PPA Payment Custodial Agreement is not pledged as part of the Trust Estate.

<!-- Page 1151 -->
FAILURE TO DELIVER OR RECEIVE COMMODITIES

Because NCEA will have prepaid for all of the natural gas and electricity to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier will be required to pay NCEA for all Commodities that the Commodity Supplier fails to deliver or NCEA fails to receive for any reason, including events of force majeure. The amount the Commodity Supplier is required to pay is equal to the quantity that was not delivered or received multiplied by a price that is determined in a manner depending upon the reason for such failure:

- If the Commodity Supplier breaches its obligation to deliver gas or electricity (i.e., for reasons other than force majeure or action or inaction by NCEA), NCEA shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to purchase Replacement Gas during the Gas Delivery Period or Replacement Electricity during the Electricity Delivery Period, and the Commodity Supplier is required to pay the higher of (a) the replacement costs incurred by NCEA or the Project Participant to purchase replacement gas or electricity, including in some instances replacement gas purchased after the fact to replace any stored gas that was used to cover the delivery shortfall, or (b) the Monthly Index Price during the Gas Delivery Period or the Day-Ahead Market Price during the Electricity Delivery Period, plus in either case a specified administrative fee of per unit of undelivered gas or electricity. If no replacement gas is actually purchased to cover the delivery shortfall, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay NCEA the Monthly Index Price during the Gas Delivery Period or the Day-Ahead Market Price during the Electricity Delivery Period.

- If NCEA breaches its obligation to take Commodities (i.e., for reasons other than force majeure or action or inaction by the Commodity Supplier), the Commodity Supplier is required to pay (a) during the Gas Delivery Period, the lesser of the Monthly Index Price or a daily low market index price, less specified remarketing fees and (b) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the price at which the Commodity Supplier, acting in a Commercially Reasonable manner, resells at the applicable delivery point any electricity not received by NCEA, deducting from such proceeds any (i) costs reasonably incurred by Seller in reselling such electricity and (ii) additional transmission charges, if any, reasonably incurred by the Commodity Supplier in delivering such electricity to the third party purchasers, or at the Commodity Supplier’s option, the market price at the applicable delivery point for such electricity not received as determined by the Commodity Supplier in a Commercially Reasonable manner.

- If either the Commodity Supplier fails to deliver Commodities or NCEA fails to receive Commodities due to events of force majeure, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay (a) during the Gas Delivery Period, the applicable Index Price and (b) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the applicable Day-Ahead Market Price.

COMMODITY REMARKETING

If the Project Participant is in default under the Commodity Supply Contract or does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Commodities purchased by NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement as a result of (a) Project Participant’s decreased gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period or (b) decreased demand by Project Participant’s retail customers, NCEA agrees to require the Commodity Supplier to remarket to other purchasers all or a specified portion of the  
-36-

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Commodities to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement by delivering Monthly Remarketing Notices or Daily Remarketing Notices as provided in the Commodity Purchase Agreement. J. Aron has agreed to provide all services necessary for the Commodity Supplier to meet its commodity remarketing obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT — J. Aron as Agent.”

There are three types of potential remarketing sales when proper notice has been tendered: qualified sales to Municipal Utilities, non-private business use sales and private business use sales. The Commodity Supplier is required to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remarket Commodities first in qualified sales and next in non-private business use sales. If the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket the Commodities designated in a remarketing notice in qualified sales or in non-private business use sales, it will purchase the Commodities. Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Supplier delegates, and J. Aron assumes, all of the Commodity Supplier’s Commodity remarketing obligations under the remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT— J. Aron as Agent—Commodity Remarketing.”

The amounts payable by the Commodity Supplier for Commodities remarketed are the actual sale proceeds or the amounts based on the Index Price, depending on the timing of the notice given by NCEA and the type of remarketing, less specified remarketing fees.

The Commodity Supplier must track in dollar and Commodity unit ledgers information relating to the remarketing proceeds and the quantities of Commodities remarketed, including sales made to the Project Participant and other Municipal Utilities, to non-private business users and to private business users. NCEA will seek to make additional qualified sales, and the Commodity Supplier will seek to locate opportunities for NCEA to purchase Commodities to sell in additional qualified sales, in each case to reduce the ledger amounts associated with non-private and private business use sales.

Assigned Electricity. If the quantity of Assigned Electricity that is delivered under an Assigned PPA is less than the Assigned Prepay Quantity in any month for any reason other than force majeure, NCEA will be deemed to have requested the Commodity Supplier to remarket the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered. The Commodity Supplier will sell such portion in a private business use sale and will pay NCEA the product of (a) the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered and (b) the Contract Specified Price minus the applicable Remarketing Fee. All such sales made by the Commodity Supplier will be entered on the private business sales ledger that is maintained pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

LEDGER EVENT

The Commodity Supplier is required to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remarket gas first in Qualified Sales and next in Non-Private Business Sales. If the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket the Commodity designated in a remarketing notice in Qualified Sales or in Non-Private Business Sales, it will purchase the Commodity. To the extent the Commodity Supplier purchases such Commodity or remarkets such Commodity other than in Qualified Sales to Municipal Utilities, NCEA will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to use the proceeds of such remarketing to purchase Commodities for resale in Qualified Sales.

# PAYMENT PROVISIONS

[The additional prepayment from NCEA to the Commodity Supplier will be due prior to the inception of the term of the Commodity Purchase Agreement.] To the extent amounts become payable by the Commodity Supplier (for example, as a result of a remarketing or a failure to deliver by the Commodity Supplier), such amounts are due on the 22nd day of the month following the month in which such amounts accrue (or, if later, the tenth day following receipt of an invoice). Amounts payable by NCEA are due on the 25th day of the month following the month in which such amounts accrue (or, if later, the tenth day following receipt of an invoice).

# FORCE MAJEURE

Each of NCEA and the Commodity Supplier are excused from their respective obligations to receive and deliver Commodities under the Commodity Purchase Agreement to the extent prevented by force majeure, defined generally as an event or circumstance which prevents one party from performing its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, which event or circumstance was not anticipated as of the date of the execution of the Commodity Purchase Agreement, which is not within the reasonable control of, or the result of the negligence of, the claiming party, and which, by the exercise of due diligence, the claiming party is unable to overcome or avoid or cause to be avoided. This excuse to performance includes such events as natural disasters, unusually extreme or severe weather related events, interruption or curtailment of gas transportation or storage, governmental actions, and strikes.

# ASSIGNMENT

Neither party may assign its rights under the Commodity Purchase Agreement without the other party’s consent except:

(a) pursuant to the Indenture, NCEA may transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign the Commodity Purchase Agreement to the Trustee in connection with a financing arrangement; provided that NCEA may not assign its rights under the Commodity Purchase Agreement unless, contemporaneously with the effectiveness of such assignment, NCEA also assigns the NCEA Commodity Swap and the NCEA Custodial Agreement to the same assignee; and

(b) the Commodity Supplier may assign the Commodity Purchase Agreement to an affiliate of the Commodity Supplier, which assignment shall constitute a novation; provided that the assignee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and (i) the Commodity Supplier delivers a Rating Confirmation to NCEA with respect to such assignment, (ii) contemporaneously with the effectiveness of such assignment, the Commodity Supplier also assigns the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement and the SPE Master Custodial Agreement to the same assignee and either (A) the Commodity Supplier assigns the Funding Agreement and the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to the same assignee or (B) the assignee provides to NCEA a guarantee by GSG of the assignee’s obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, and (iii) the assignee is a special purpose entity approved by NCEA or its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement are guaranteed by a Funding Recipient to the satisfaction of NCEA.

-39-
<!-- Page 1155 -->
If either (a) the Commodity Supplier notifies NCEA that the Funding Agreement will not be replaced, re-financed or re-priced as of the end of any Interest Rate Period for the Bonds, (b) the Commodity Supplier is unable to provide, under the Re-Pricing Agreement, an estimated Available Discount for any Reset Period that is equal to or greater than the applicable minimum discount under the Commodity Supply Contract or (c) NCEA can provide reasonable evidence that the Commodity Supplier’s estimated Reset Period Implied Rate (as defined in the Re-Pricing Agreement) is materially less than the rate the Commodity Supplier would offer to a substantially similar counterparty in an arm’s length transaction on the same date, then, at the request of NCEA, the Commodity Supplier will reasonably cooperate with NCEA to cause the Commodity Supplier’s (or the Commodity Supplier’s affiliate’s) right, title and interest in the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Re-Pricing Agreement, the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap and all agreements related to any of the foregoing to be novated to a replacement seller. The Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Indenture impose certain requirements for any such novation, including the delivery of a Rating Confirmation.

FUNDING AGREEMENT

Except (a) to cure any ambiguity, supply any omission, or cure or correct any defect or inconsistent provision in the Funding Agreement, (b) to insert such provisions clarifying matters or questions arising under the Funding Agreement as are necessary or desirable and are not contrary to or inconsistent therewith or (c) to convert or supplement any provision in a manner consistent with the intent of the Funding Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the Commodity Supplier agrees in the Commodity Purchase Agreement that it shall not agree to any amendment, alteration, assignment or modification to the Funding Agreement or any guaranty of the Funding Recipient’s obligations thereunder without receipt of a Rating Confirmation and the prior written consent of NCEA; provided that the consent of NCEA shall not be required in connection with (i) the replacement, refinancing or re-pricing of the Funding Agreement at the end of any Interest Rate Period in accordance with the terms of the Funding Agreement or (ii) the Commodity Supplier’s assignment of its interest in the Funding Agreement or consent to Funding Recipient’s assignment of its interest in the Funding Agreement to the extent the Commodity Supplier provides a Rating Confirmation to NCEA with respect to any such assignment.

EARLY TERMINATION

A Commodity Delivery Termination Date will occur automatically under the Commodity Purchase Agreement upon the occurrence of a Termination Payment Event (which includes a Failed Remarketing with respect to the Bonds) or an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event (as such terms are described below). Upon the occurrence of an Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event (as described below), a Commodity Delivery Termination Date may be designated by the Commodity Supplier, as described below. If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs, the Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will end and, if the Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs as a result of a Termination Payment Event, the Commodity Supplier will be required to make the payment or payments described under “Remedies and Termination” below.

<!-- Page 1156 -->
![Termination Payment Event](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Termination+Payment+Event)

**Termination Payment Event.** A Termination Payment Event will occur under the Commodity Purchase Agreement if:

- [• the exercise by the Funding Recipient of the Funding Recipient Acceleration Option;]
- [• the exercise by the Commodity Supplier of the Commodity Supplier Acceleration Option;]

• the Commodity Supplier fails to pay when due any amounts owed to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement because of a failure by the Funding Recipient to pay when due any amounts owed to the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Funding Agreement and such failure continues for 30 days after NCEA gives notice thereof to the Commodity Supplier;

• as of three Business Days prior to the last day of exchange trading for Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange (or successor thereto) for deliveries in the first month following a Reset Period, either (a) NCEA has not entered into a bond purchase agreement, firm remarketing agreement or similar agreement with respect to the remarketing or refunding of the Bonds or (b) the Commodity Supplier is unable to replace, refinance or re-price the Funding Agreement for a subsequent Reset Period;

• a Failed Remarketing occurs; or

• both (a) the Project Participant makes a Remarketing Election for a Reset Period, and (b) J. Aron exercises its option to designate a CSSA Early Termination Date under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement.

**Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Events.** The Commodity Supplier will have the right to designate a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement under the following circumstances:

• a Ledger Event occurs; or

• except in the case where an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event has occurred, both (a) an early termination date under the NCEA Commodity Swap is designated by the Commodity Swap Counterparty or occurs automatically based on a termination event where NCEA is the sole affected party and (b) either the NCEA Commodity Swap or the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap is not replaced within the Swap Replacement Period.

**Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Events.** A Commodity Delivery Termination Date will occur automatically, that will not result on its own as a Termination Payment Event, under the Commodity Purchase Agreement under the following circumstances:

• following receipt of an offer by the Trustee to sell Swap Call Receivables under the Receivables Purchase Provisions, the Commodity Supplier does not exercise (or is deemed not to have exercised) its related option to purchase Swap Call Receivables within the timeline set forth in the Receivables Purchase Provisions; 

-41-
<!-- Page 1157 -->
• both (a) a CSSA Early Termination Date occurs under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, and (b) the Commodity Supplier is unable to enter into a replacement Commodity Sale and Service Agreement in compliance with the requirements of the Commodity Purchase Agreement by the date that is 120 days following such early termination date;

• an early termination date under the NCEA Commodity Swap is designated by the Commodity Swap Counterparty based on an event of default due to NCEA’s insolvency or bankruptcy; or

• both (a) an early termination date under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap is designated by the Commodity Swap Counterparty based on an event of default where the Commodity Supplier is the defaulting party or a termination event where the Commodity Supplier is the sole affected party, or otherwise occurs automatically and (b) except for certain events of default and termination events for which the Swap Replacement Period does not apply, either the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap or the NCEA Commodity Swap is not replaced within the Swap Replacement Period.

REPLACEMENT OF COMMODITY SWAPS

NCEA and the Commodity Supplier agree in the Commodity Purchase Agreement that if any Commodity Swap terminates, is being terminated or is expected to be terminated, in each case for any reason other than the insolvency of NCEA or the Commodity Supplier or the failure of the Commodity Supplier to make payments or post collateral due under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, then:

(a) (i) if an NCEA Commodity Swap and a Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap with another Commodity Swap Counterparty are in effect and are not subject to termination, NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will exercise any rights they may have to increase their notional quantities thereunder in order to replace the Commodity Swap affected by the events described above and the other Commodity Swap and (ii) subsequent to such a replacement, NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will cooperate in good faith to locate replacement agreements with a second Commodity Swap Counterparty and, upon locating such second Commodity Swap Counterparty, NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will reduce their notional quantities under the remaining Commodity Swaps to their original levels and enter into replacement Commodity Swaps with the replacement Commodity Swap Counterparty for the remaining notional quantities; and

(b) if NCEA and the Commodity Supplier cannot increase the notional quantities of the Commodity Swaps as described in (a) above, they will cooperate in good faith to locate replacement agreements with an alternate Swap Counterparty to replace both of the Commodity Swaps within the Swap Replacement Period.

The “Swap Replacement Period” is the period that begins on the earlier of the date of (x) any termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap or the Commodity Supplier Swap designated by the Commodity Swap Counterparty and (y) delivery of a notice of anticipated termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap or the Commodity Supplier Swap by a Swap Counterparty, and ends 60 days later.

# REMEDIES AND TERMINATION PAYMENT

**Commodity Delivery Termination Date.** A Commodity Delivery Termination Date will occur automatically upon the occurrence of a Termination Payment Event or an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event. If an Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, then the Commodity Supplier, as described above, may designate a Commodity Delivery Termination Date.

**End of Delivery Period.** As of the Commodity Delivery Termination Date:

(a) the Delivery Period will end;

(b) the obligation of NCEA to receive deliveries of Commodities will terminate; and

(c) the obligation of the Commodity Supplier to make any further deliveries of Commodities will terminate and, unless such Commodity Delivery Termination Date resulted from a Termination Payment Event, will be replaced with a continuing obligation of the Commodity Supplier to pay scheduled monthly amounts to NCEA until the earlier of (i) the Month in which a Termination Payment Event occurs and (ii) the last due date for such scheduled payments; and

The Commodity Purchase Agreement will continue in effect after the Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs. The occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date will not prevent the contemporaneous or subsequent occurrence of a Termination Payment Event.

**Termination Payment; Early Termination Payment Date.** Following a Termination Payment Event, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay the Termination Payment to the Trustee on the Early Termination Payment Date. The “Early Termination Payment Date” is the last Business Day of the first Month that commences after a Termination Payment Event occurs. In the case of a Termination Payment Event that results from a Failed Remarketing, the Early Termination Payment Date will be the last Business Day of the current Interest Rate Period. The obligation of the Commodity Supplier to pay the Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date is unconditional, and the Commodity Supplier waives all rights to set-off, counterclaim, recoupment and any other defenses that might otherwise be available with regard to its obligation to pay the Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date.

The amount of the Termination Payment is set forth on a schedule to the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Termination Payment payable by the Commodity Supplier, together with the amounts required to be on deposit in certain Funds and Accounts held by the Trustee, has been calculated to provide a sum at least sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of the Bonds, assuming that the Funding Recipient, the Project Participant, the Commodity Supplier and the Investment Agreement Provider pay and perform their respective contract obligations when due. If the Debt Service Reserve Account is depleted due to payment defaults by the Project Participant and is not timely replenished, the Termination Payment and the other available funds held under the Indenture will likely not be adequate to redeem the Bonds in full. See APPENDIX I for a schedule of the Termination Payment as of specified Early Termination Payment Dates under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

# RECEIVABLES PURCHASE PROVISIONS

Under certain circumstances, the Commodity Supplier has agreed to purchase from NCEA the rights to payment of net amounts owed by the Project Participant (“Swap Call Receivables”) under the Commodity Supply Contract.

## Swap Call Receivables
If the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under the Commodity Supply Contract, and such nonpayment results in a Swap Payment Deficiency, then on the next succeeding Business Day, NCEA shall deliver a written offer (a “Swap Call Receivables Offer”) to sell to the Commodity Supplier sufficient Swap Call Receivables (such amount, less any undisputed amounts owed by NCEA to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, the “Swap Call Receivables Amount”) to fund such Swap Payment Deficiency. No later than one Business Day following the Commodity Supplier’s receipt of a Swap Call Receivables Offer, the Commodity Supplier may elect, in its discretion, to purchase the Swap Call Receivables referenced in the Swap Call Receivables Offer by delivering a written notice (“Call Option Notice”) to NCEA of the Commodity Supplier’s intent to purchase such Swap Call Receivables. If the Commodity Supplier does not deliver a Call Option Notice to NCEA on or before the Business Day following the Commodity Supplier’s receipt of a Swap Call Receivables Offer, the Commodity Supplier will be deemed to have elected not to purchase the referenced Swap Call Receivables, which constitutes an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

## Elective Call Receivables
If the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under its Commodity Supply Contract with PEAK and such payment default does not result in a Swap Payment Deficiency, the Trustee shall deliver a written offer (an “Elective Call Receivables Offer”) to sell to the Commodity Supplier the receivables relating to such payment default (“Elective Call Receivables”) and, together with Swap Call Receivables, “Call Receivables”). Any time after the Commodity Supplier’s receipt of an Elective Call Receivables Offer, the Commodity Supplier may elect, in its discretion, to purchase the Elective Call Receivables referenced in the Elective Call Receivables Offer by delivering a written notice to the Trustee of the Commodity Supplier’s intent to purchase such Elective Call Receivables. The election by the Commodity Supplier not to purchase Swap Call Receivables is not an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

## Conditions to Purchase and Sale of Call Receivables
NCEA’s obligation to offer to sell such Call Receivables is subject to the condition that all of the representations and warranties made by the Commodity Supplier at the time of execution and delivery of the Receivables Purchase Provisions be true and correct on each day that the Trustee is required to offer to sell Call Receivables.

## Call Receivables Purchase by J. Aron
Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, J. Aron has agreed to purchase any Call Receivable purchased by the Commodity Supplier under the Receivables Purchase Provisions; provided that J. Aron’s obligation to purchase Call Receivables is subject to it having provided its prior written consent to the purchase of such Call Receivables by the Commodity Supplier. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT.”

# THE RE-PRICING AGREEMENT

Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Re-Pricing Agreement. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Re-Pricing Agreement and accordingly is qualified by reference to the full text thereof.

## GENERAL

The Re-Pricing Agreement provides for (a) the determination of delivery periods (“Reset Periods”) subsequent to the Reset Period that corresponds to the Interest Rate Reset Period on the Bonds and the calculation of the amount of the discount (in cents per Commodity Unit) that is available (the “Available Discount”) for sales of Commodities to the Project Participant during each Reset Period.

“Commodity Unit” means [one MMBtu of gas or one MWh of electricity, as applicable]. [NTD: “Commodity Unit” needs to be defined.]

The Reset Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement that corresponds to the Interest Rate Reset Period begins on the first day of ________ 20__ and ends on the last day of ________ 20__ and the next Reset Period is expected to begin on the first day of ________ 20__.

## REMARKETING ELECTION

In the event that the Available Discount for any Reset Period is less than the minimum discount specified in the Commodity Supply Contract (which includes both monthly discounts and any annual refunds), the Project Participant may elect not to take Commodities during the Reset Period and to have such Commodities remarketed for the duration of the Reset Period (a “Remarketing Election”) by giving notice of such election to NCEA, the Commodity Supplier and NCEA. Any Commodities that are covered by a Remarketing Election will be remarketed in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event that the Project Participant makes a Remarketing Election with respect to a Reset Period, J. Aron will have the option to terminate the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. If J. Aron exercises this option, a Termination Payment Event and an Early Payment Termination Date will occur under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE RE-PRICING AGREEMENT” and “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT — Remarketing” and “— Early Termination.” [NTD: Above description does not match the CSSA which retains the “50% of Contract Quantities” phrasing for the termination option.]

## REPLACEMENT OF FUNDING AGREEMENT

The Re-Pricing Agreement includes provisions that enable the Commodity Supplier to obtain proposals from the Funding Recipient and other qualified funding providers for funding agreements to replace the Funding Agreement upon the maturity date of the Funding Agreement (which coincides with the end of the Interest Rate Reset Period). NCEA agrees to cooperate in good faith with the Commodity Supplier and to take all steps reasonably within its control to cause the Bonds to be remarketed or refunded for the Interest Rate Period that corresponds to each Reset Period.

# THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT

Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and accordingly is qualified by reference to the full text thereof.

## GENERAL

Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, J. Aron has agreed to sell and deliver the Contract Quantity of Commodities each gas day during the Gas Delivery Period and each delivery hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, as applicable, in exchange for payment from the Commodity Supplier of an amount equal to the applicable Index Price for the delivery point set forth in the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, plus any price differential for the delivery point, plus a specified fee per Commodity Unit (the “J. Aron Commodity Fee”), regardless of whether or not such Commodities are delivered pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. The daily quantities of gas, hourly quantities of electricity, delivery point provisions and delivery period under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement match the corresponding provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and, in turn, the corresponding provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract. In addition to the J. Aron Commodity Fee, the Commodity Supplier agrees to pay a structuring fee on the effective date of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement in consideration of its services in connection with the arrangement, establishment, hedging and funding of the Commodity Project.

## J. ARON AS AGENT

### General

Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Supplier appoints and directs J. Aron as its agent and J. Aron agrees to issue notices and other communications, billing statements and to take any other actions that the Commodity Supplier is required or permitted to take under (a) the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (b) the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, (c) the Re-Pricing Agreement, and (d) the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (collectively, the “Commodity Documents”); provided that J. Aron’s agency role with respect to the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement shall be limited to ordinary course actions required in connection with the Commodity Project and J. Aron shall have no right to waive, modify or amend the terms of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement on the Commodity Supplier’s behalf or to act on the Commodity Supplier’s behalf with respect to any dispute thereunder. In exercising this agency power, J. Aron shall have the authority to take any such actions as it deems necessary under the Commodity Documents.

### Standard of Care

In the conduct and performance of its agency role, J. Aron shall conduct itself consistent with and observe the same standard of care as it has in similar transactions in which J. Aron has acted as the seller under prepaid natural gas and commodities agreements, and the Commodity Supplier acknowledges and agrees that J. Aron shall have no obligation to observe a standard of care greater than it has in such similar transactions or to take any actions or measures beyond those it typically takes in connection with such transactions. J. Aron shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in acting as agent on behalf of the Commodity Supplier, except as expressly set forth in the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement.

### Commodities Remarketing

Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Supplier delegates, and J. Aron assumes, all of the Commodity Supplier’s Commodities remarketing obligations under the remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement (subject to certain limitations set forth).

# LEDGER EVENT PAYMENTS

If a Ledger Event occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and (i) [Commodity Supplier/Funding Recipient] has not exercised the [Commodity Supplier/Funding Recipient] Acceleration Option and (ii) an Early Termination Payment Date has not otherwise occurred or been designated thereunder, J. Aron agrees to pay to the Commodity Supplier scheduled Ledger Event Payments calculated to provide a sum sufficient (together with the interest component of the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits) to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate. Such payments are due to the Commodity Supplier on (a) the Business Day preceding each Interest Payment Date and the Mandatory Purchase Date, and (b) any Early Termination Payment Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT — Ledger Event” and “THE BONDS — Increased Interest Rate Upon Ledger Event.”

# ASSIGNMENT

Neither party may assign its rights or obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement without the other party’s consent, except that J. Aron may assign the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to an affiliate of J. Aron, which assignment will constitute a novation; provided that (a) the CSSA Guaranty continues to apply to the obligations of such assignee under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement or (b) the assignee delivers to the Commodity Supplier a Rating Confirmation with respect to such assignment.

# DEFAULTS AND TERMINATION EVENTS

## J. Aron Default. 
Each of the following events constitutes a “J. Aron Default” under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement:

(a) J. Aron fails to pay when due any amounts owed to the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and such failure continues for five days after receipt by J. Aron of notice thereof, unless GSG has made such payment under the CSSA Guaranty;

(b) certain bankruptcy or insolvency events with respect to J. Aron; or

(c) the CSSA Guaranty ceases to be in full force and effect or is declared to be null and void, or GSG contests the validity or enforceability of the CSSA Guaranty; provided that no such event will occur as a consequence of GSG becoming subject to a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding.

## Commodity Supplier Default. 
Each of the following events constitutes a “Commodity Supplier Default” under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement:

(a) the Commodity Supplier fails to pay when due any amounts owed to J. Aron pursuant to the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and such failure continues for thirty Business Days after receipt by the Commodity Supplier of notice thereof; or

![Optional Non-Default Termination Event](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Optional+Non-Default+Termination+Event)

**Optional Non-Default Termination Event.** Each of the following events constitutes an “Optional Non–Default Termination Event” under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement:

(a) the Commodity Supplier has the option to terminate the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement during the Gas Delivery Period if a “Persistent Delivery Failure” occurs as a result of;

(i) J. Aron failing to deliver any gas for 12 consecutive gas days at all delivery points;

(ii) J. Aron delivering less than 50% of all gas required to be delivered at all delivery points on any 45 consecutive gas days; or

(iii) J. Aron delivering less than 85% of all gas required to be delivered at all delivery points on any 180 gas days (consecutive or non-consecutive) during any period of 365 consecutive days; or

(b) J. Aron has the option to terminate the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement if the Commodity Supplier provides that the Project Participant has made a Remarketing Election for any Reset Period (a “GSC Remarketing Event”). [NTD: See note on p. 48.]

**Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event.** The occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement constitutes an “Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event” under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement.

**REMEDIES AND TERMINATION**

Upon the occurrence of a J. Aron Default or a Commodity Supplier Default, the non-defaulting party may designate an early termination date under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (a “CSSA Early Termination Date”). Upon the occurrence of an Optional Non–Default Termination Event due to a Persistent Delivery Failure, the Commodity Supplier may designate a CSSA Early Termination Date. Upon the occurrence of an Optional Non–Default Termination Event due to a GSC Remarketing Event, J. Aron may designate a CSSA Early Termination Date. A CSSA Early Termination Date will occur automatically upon the occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs, the Delivery Period for gas under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement will end and the obligations of the parties to deliver and receive gas will terminate.

**SECURITY**

GSG has provided to the Commodity Supplier a guaranty of J. Aron’s payment obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (the “CSSA Guaranty”). None of NCEA, the Trustee or the Bondholders have rights to enforce the CSSA Guaranty.

THE COMMODITY SUPPLIER

Organization. The Commodity Supplier is a Delaware limited liability company organized for the sole purpose of entering into the transactions on its part with respect to the Commodity Project described herein. J. Aron is the sole member of the Commodity Supplier (the “Member”), and has funded the Commodity Supplier with the cash equity contribution and the subordinated loans described below.

The Commodity Supplier is governed by a three-member board of directors. One director is appointed by J. Aron, one director is appointed by NCEA, and the third director is an independent director appointed by J. Aron. The directors have appointed J. Aron as the manager of the Commodity Supplier.

The director appointed by NCEA has the sole consent rights with respect to certain matters, including: (i) the designation of a CSSA Early Termination Date under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement; the designation of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement due to the occurrence of a Ledger Event; the enforcement of the Funding Agreement; under certain circumstances, the removal and replacement of J.

<!-- Page 1167 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap; and (b) the termination or replacement of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap.

The independent director is required to consider only the interests of the Commodity Supplier and its creditors in acting or voting on certain material actions that require the unanimous consent of the directors. No resignation or removal of the independent director will be effective until a successor independent director has accepted his or her appointment.

Subordinated Loan Agreements; Capitalization. Pursuant to two Subordinated Term Loan Agreements (the “Subordinated Loan Agreements”), J. Aron has agreed (a) to make an initial term loan to the Commodity Supplier in the amount of $ ______ million not later than the closing date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (the “Initial Term Loan”), and (b) if, following an Event of Default (as defined in the Funding Agreement) with respect to the Funding Recipient, the Commodity Supplier exercises its right to demand payment of the entire amount held in the Funding Account (or the Funding Agreement terminates automatically due the dissolution, liquidation or similar proceeding with respect to the Funding Recipient), an additional loan of up to $ ______ million on any Early Termination Payment Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (the “Contingent Term Loan”). The Commodity Supplier’s repayment obligations under the Subordinated Loan Agreements are subordinate to the Commodity Supplier’s obligations under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to the extent set forth in the SPE Master Custodial Agreement described below.

J. Aron will also make a cash equity contribution to the Commodity Supplier. The cash equity contribution, the amount of the Initial Term Loan and, if made, the amount of the Contingent Term Loan together equal at least three percent of the outstanding (unamortized) balance of the prepayment under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (approximately $ ______ million as of the Initial Issue Date).

SPE Master Custodial Agreement. The Commodity Supplier, J. Aron, NCEA and The Bank of New York Mellon, as custodian (the “SPE Master Custodian”), will enter into an SPE Master Custodial Agreement (the “SPE Master Custodial Agreement”) to administer:

(a) the amounts payable to the Commodity Supplier under (i) the Funding Agreement, (ii) the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, (iii) the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (iv) the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap and (v) the Subordinated Loan Agreements, and

(b) the Funding Agreement and the amounts payable by the Commodity Supplier under (i) the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (ii) the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, (iii) the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap and (iv) the Subordinated Loan Agreements.

The SPE Master Custodial Agreement establishes a revenue account (the “Commodity Supplier Revenue Account”) and a capital account (the “Commodity Supplier Capital Account”) with the SPE Master Custodian. The amounts payable to the Commodity Supplier under the Funding Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap are to be paid directly into the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account.

Under the SPE Master Custodial Agreement, the SPE Master Custodian will, to the extent of the amounts on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account, make monthly transfers for the payment of

-52-
<!-- Page 1168 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

amounts due by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. Following these monthly transfers, any remaining funds in the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account are transferred to the Commodity Supplier Capital Account. Pending their application, the amounts in the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account are held in trust for the benefit of the Commodity Supplier.

The Commodity Supplier Capital Account will be initially funded by J. Aron with the cash equity contribution and the Initial Term Loan under the Subordinated Loan Agreements. [From these sources, an amount equal to the Minimum Amount will be deposited in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account. Under the SPE Master Custodial Agreement, the amounts in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account may be invested only in direct obligations of the United States or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the United States, in either case with a maturity of two years or less, certain certificates of deposit and demand deposits, certain money market funds and cash.

Amounts on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account shall be withdrawn by the SPE Master Custodian and applied: first, to the extent the SPE Master Custodian determines necessary to meet the Commodity Supplier’s collateral posting obligations under the credit support annex to the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap; and second to make up any deficiency of the amounts on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account for the purposes described above.

The SPE Master Custodian shall only withdraw amounts on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account for payment of principal and interest on the Subordinated Loan Agreements to the extent that the “Commodity Supplier Capital Amount” (defined below) exceeds the greater of (i) three percent of the outstanding (unamortized) balance of the prepayment under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and (ii) $[_____] after the monthly payments from the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account and the Commodity Supplier Capital Account described above. The SPE Master Custodian shall not be required to transfer any amount from the Commodity Supplier Capital Account for the monthly payment of principal and interest on the Subordinated Loan Agreements if the remaining balance in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account following such transfer will be less than $[_____] .

“Commodity Supplier Capital Amount” means, at any time, the sum of (y) amounts then on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account, and (z) all committed amounts then available for Commodity Supplier to draw under the Subordinated Loan Agreements, as notified by Commodity Supplier to the SPE Master Custodian from time to time.

The SPE Master Custodian shall have a lien, security interest and right of set-off against the Commodity Supplier Capital Account for the payment of any claim by the SPE Master Custodian for compensation, reimbursement or indemnity under the SPE Master Custodial Agreement.

Under no circumstance is the Commodity Supplier, J. Aron or GSG obligated to pay any amounts owed in respect of the Bonds.

Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Commodity. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Commodity Swaps and accordingly is qualified by reference to the full text of the Commodity Swaps.

GENERAL

As noted above, effective as of the Initial Issue Date: (a) NCEA’s 2018 swap agreement will be amended and restated to replace RBCEL with Royal Bank as the Commodity Swap Counterparty and to include notional quantities of Commodities with respect to the additional quantities of Commodities to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (as amended and restated, the “NCEA Commodity Swap”); (b) J. Aron will notate and transfer all of its interests under its 2018 swap agreement with RBCEL to the Commodity Supplier; and (c) the Commodity Supplier’s 2018 swap agreement will be amended and restated to replace RBCEL with Royal Bank as the Commodity Swap Counterparty and to include notional quantities of Commodities with respect to the additional quantities Commodities to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (as amended and restated, the “Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap”).

Gas Delivery Period. Commencing with gas deliveries for 20 __, NCEA will pay a floating natural gas price at a specified pricing point and will receive a fixed natural gas price for notional quantities that correspond to the quantities of natural gas and the related delivery point under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. Under the NCEA Commodity Swap, for each calendar month that the relevant floating price of natural gas at the delivery point is greater than the fixed price specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap, NCEA will be obligated to pay the Commodity Swap Counterparty an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the floating price and the fixed price multiplied by (y) a notional quantity equal to the quantity of gas scheduled to be delivered at the delivery point during such month by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the fixed price specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap is greater than the relevant floating price of natural gas at the delivery point for a month, the Commodity Swap Counterparty will be obligated to pay NCEA an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the fixed price and floating price multiplied by (y) a notional quantity equal to the quantity of gas scheduled to be delivered at the delivery point during such month by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the relevant floating price for a calendar month is equal to the specified fixed price, no payment will be owed by either party to the other under the NCEA Commodity Swap.

<!-- Page 1170 -->
Under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Supplier pays a fixed natural gas price and receives a floating natural gas price for the same notional quantities at the same pricing point.

**Electricity Delivery Period.** During the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Swaps will be dormant and no payments will be required to be made under them to the extent that all of the Contract Quantities of electricity are fixed price Assigned Prepay Quantities. To the extent that Hourly Quantities of electricity are delivered by the Commodity Supplier, NCEA will pay a floating electricity price at a specified pricing point and will receive a fixed electricity price for notional quantities that correspond to the quantities of electricity and the related delivery point under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. Under the NCEA Commodity Swap, for each delivery hour that the relevant floating price of electricity at the delivery point is greater than the fixed price specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap, NCEA will be obligated to pay to the Commodity Swap Counterparty an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the floating price and the fixed price multiplied by (y) a notional quantity equal to the quantity of electricity scheduled to be delivered at the delivery point during such delivery hour by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the fixed price specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap is greater than the relevant floating price of electricity at the delivery point for a delivery hour, the Commodity Swap Counterparty will be obligated to pay NCEA an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the fixed and floating price multiplied by (y) a notional quantity equal to the quantity of electricity scheduled to be delivered at the delivery point during such delivery hour by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the floating price for a delivery hour is equal to the specified fixed price, no payment will be owed by either party to the other under the NCEA Commodity Swap.

**Term.** Each of the Commodity Swaps has an initial term that commences on the date that Commodity deliveries begin under the amended and restated Commodity Purchase Agreement and extends for two calendar months. The Commodity Swaps have rolling two-month terms that renew automatically upon the payment due date of each monthly net settlement amount due thereunder through the term of the Gas Delivery Period (or Electricity Delivery Period, as applicable) under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, unless a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

**FORM OF COMMODITY SWAPS**  
Each of the Commodity Swaps has been entered into as a confirmation under a 2002 ISDA Master Agreement with certain amendments and elections under the Master Agreement that have been agreed to by the parties.

**PAYMENT**  
For each month of scheduled Commodities deliveries and notional amounts, each party with a net obligation under a Commodity Swap (based on the relative values of the fixed price and relevant index prices) will pay that net obligation to the other party. Payments under the Commodity Swaps are due in the calendar month following the month to which the applicable Commodity index prices relate, on the 24th day of the month (or preceding business day) in the case of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap and on the 25th day of the month (or next business day) in the case of the NCEA Commodity Swap.

**EARLY TERMINATION**

Each of the Commodity Swaps will be subject to early termination under certain circumstances. Early termination can be triggered automatically or upon the election by the non-defaulting party as summarized below.

No settlement or other termination payment (other than Unpaid Amounts) will be due to any party as a result of any early termination of any Commodity Swap.

**Automatic Termination of Commodity Swaps.** Each of the following events would result in the automatic termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap:

- the occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement for any reason, in which case the Commodity Swaps will terminate automatically on such date; and
- delivery by NCEA of a notice of termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap results in the automatic termination of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, and delivery by the Commodity Supplier of a notice of termination of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap results in the automatic termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap.

**Elective Termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap.** Each of the following events of default and termination events would provide the non-defaulting party or the affected party the right to terminate the NCEA Commodity Swap if it is not cured within the applicable cure period:

- a party becomes subject to certain insolvency events in the manner specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap;
- the Commodity Swap Counterparty fails to satisfy its credit support obligations in the manner specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap;
- a reduction below certain specified minimum ratings in the credit rating assigned by the applicable rating agency to the Commodity Swap Counterparty’s senior, unsecured long-term debt obligations (not supported by third party credit enhancements) or, if there is no such rating, then the Commodity Swap Counterparty’s issuer rating (the “Commodity Swap Counterparty’s Credit Rating”);
- a party’s failure to pay amounts when due under the NCEA Commodity Swap (notwithstanding any payments made by the Custodian under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement) that is not remedied within three business days after notice;
- amendment of the Indenture in breach of the Commodity Swap Counterparty’s consent rights thereunder;

-56-
<!-- Page 1172 -->
• the amendment, without the Commodity Swap Counterparty’s consent, of certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement relating to the termination or assignment thereof, or that would affect terminations of the Commodity Swaps; and

• NCEA fails to promptly exercise its right to suspend all Commodity deliveries under the Commodity Supply Contract if the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed to NCEA thereunder.

**Elective Termination of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap.** Each of the following events of default and termination events would provide the non-defaulting party or the affected party the right to terminate the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap if it is not cured within the applicable cure period:

• if a party becomes subject to certain insolvency events in the manner specified in the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap;

• a party fails to satisfy its credit support obligations in the manner specified in the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap;

• any reduction in the Commodity Swap Counterparty’s Credit Rating (as described above) below certain specified minimum ratings;

• the amendment, without the Commodity Swap Counterparty’s consent, of (a) certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement relating to the termination or assignment thereof, or that would affect terminations of the Commodity Swaps or (b) certain provisions of the Receivables Purchase Provisions relating to the purchase of Swap Call Receivables by the Commodity Supplier; and

• a party’s failure to pay amounts when due under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (notwithstanding any payments made by the Custodian under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement) that is not remedied within one business day after notice.

**Other Listed Events.** The Commodity Swaps contain other listed events (including breach or repudiation, misrepresentation, illegality and certain tax and credit events) that do not give NCEA, the Commodity Supplier or the Commodity Swap Counterparty the right to designate an early termination date, but which permit the non-defaulting party or the affected party to pursue such equitable remedies, including specific performance, as may be available.

**Replacement of Commodity Swaps.** See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Replacement of Commodity Swaps” and “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS—Enforcement of Project Agreements—NCLA Commodity Swap” for a description of certain provisions of the Indenture and the Commodity Purchase Agreement regarding the replacement of a Commodity Swap that is terminated or subject to termination.

**CUSTODIAL AGREEMENT**  
As noted above, J. Aron and RBCEL will novate all of their interests under an existing custodial agreement to the Commodity Supplier and Royal Bank as the Commodity Swap Counterparty, respectively.

“Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement”), which provides for the administration of payments under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee and as custodian (in such capacity, the “Custodian”). The Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement contains certain provisions designed to mitigate risks to NCEA and Bondholders resulting from a failure of the Commodity Swap Counterparty to make payments to NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap.

Payments made by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap will be made to a custodial account maintained by the Custodian under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement. Such amounts will not be released until the Custodian has received confirmation that the amount payable to NCEA by the Commodity Swap Counterparty under the NCEA Commodity Swap for such month has been paid. If the Commodity Swap Counterparty does not make a required payment under the NCEA Commodity Swap and such payment remains unpaid after the expiration of any grace period, the Custodian will pay the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (which such amount is held in custody) to the Trustee for deposit in the Revenue Fund and that payment will be treated as a Commodity Swap Receipt. Additionally, if the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap terminates, the Commodity Supplier will continue to make payments to the custodial account as if the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap were still in effect until the earlier of (i) replacement of the Commodity Swaps in accordance with the requirements of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and (ii) termination of the Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and such payments will be used to ensure that NCEA receives deposits in the Revenue Fund as described in the preceding sentence in the event that the Commodity Swap Counterparty does not make a required payment under the NCEA Commodity Swap.

THE COMMODITY SWAP COUNTERPARTY

Set forth below is certain information regarding the Commodity Swap Counterparty. NCEA assumes no responsibility for such information and cannot guarantee the accuracy thereof. Under no circumstance is the Commodity Swap Counterparty obligated to pay any amount owed in respect of the Bonds.

[2024Q1 RBC disclosure to come.]

THE COMMODITY SUPPLY CONTRACT

Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract between NCEA and the Project Participant.

GENERAL

In 2018, NCEA and the Project Participant entered into a commodity supply contract (the “2018 Commodity Supply Contract”) which provided for the purchase and sale of Commodities over a thirty-year term ending on May 31, 2049. Effective on the Initial Issue Date of the Bonds, NCEA and the Project Participant will amend and restate the 2018 Commodity Supply Contract [to extend the term thereof and] to make certain conforming amendments (the 2018 Commodity Supply Contract as amended and restated is referred to herein as the “Commodity Supply Contract”). Deliveries of gas under the 2018 Commodity Supply Contract will continue through [__________], and deliveries of Commodities under the Commodity Supply Contract will begin in [__________] and continue to the end of the stated delivery period under the Commodity Purchase

-58-

Agreement (_______, 20__), provided that, if an Early Termination Date occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract will terminate on the Early Termination Date.

The Commodity Supply Contract provides for the sale to the Project Participant, on a pay-as-you-go basis, of all of the Commodities to be delivered to NCEA over the term of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. Under the Commodity Supply Contract, NCEA has agreed to deliver, and the Project Participant has agreed to purchase, the specified Contract Quantities of gas at a designated delivery point during the Gas Delivery Period and the specified Hourly Quantities of electricity at a designated delivery point during the Electricity Delivery Period. The Project Participant is obligated to pay NCEA for the quantities of Commodities delivered under the Commodity Supply Contract, including contracted quantities tendered for delivery by NCEA but not taken by the Project Participant (for which the Project Participant is eligible to receive a credit based on revenues received for the remarketed Commodities under certain circumstances described in such Commodity Supply Contract). The Project Participant has no obligation to pay for Commodities that NCEA fails to deliver.

**PRICING PROVISIONS**

The Commodities sold under the Commodity Supply Contract are priced at the applicable “Contract Price,” which (a) in the case of the Contract Quantity of gas, is the Monthly Index Price for the gas delivery point plus any applicable delivery point premium, (b) in the case of the Hourly Quantity of electricity, is the Day-Ahead Market Price for the electricity deliver point and (c) in the case of the Assigned Prepay Quantity of Assigned Electricity, is the fixed price per MWh set forth in the Assigned PPA, in each case less a specified discount determined in accordance with the Commodity Supply Contract.

The “Monthly Index Price” means a charge per MMBtu equal to the monthly market index price for the month of delivery reported in the first monthly edition, or the revised edition, if applicable, of the publication Inside FERC’s Gas Market Report, in the section “Monthly Bidweek Spot Gas Prices ($/MMBtu),” for the gas delivery point specified in the Commodity Supply Agreement under the column “Index.” If Inside FERC’s Gas Market Report ceases to be published, the Monthly Index Price shall be derived via an alternative index. The “Day-Ahead Market Price” means the day ahead market price or the locational marginal price for the electricity delivery point for each applicable hour as published by the California Independent System Operator Corporation, or as such price may be corrected or revised from time to time by such independent system operator or other entity in accordance with its rules.

Through the Commodity Project, the Project Participant anticipates realizing a discount to market index natural gas prices. No assurance can be given as to the total actual discounts the Project Participant will realize.

[The Project Participant must pay to NCEA a monthly Supply Administration Fee based on the Project Participant’s Daily Quantity of Commodities. The Supply Administration Fee is not included as part of the Revenues and is not pledged to the payment of the Bonds.]

**BILLING AND PAYMENT**

Not later than the 12th day of the month following the end of the delivery month, NCEA must provide a monthly billing statement to the Project Participant of the amount due for Commodities delivered during the prior month. The due date for payment by the Project Participant will be on or before the later of (a) the 22nd day of the month following the most recent month to which the billing statement relates or (b) the 10th day

-59-
<!-- Page 1175 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

following the Project Participant’s receipt of NCEA’s billing statement (or if either such day is not a business day, the preceding business day). If the Project Participant disputes the appropriateness of any charge or calculation in any billing statement, the Project Participant still must pay (absent manifest error) all amounts billed by NCEA, including any amounts in dispute, and must object to such billing statement within two years after the applicable month of delivery. If it is ultimately determined that the Project Participant did not owe the disputed amount, NCEA must pay the Project Participant the disputed amount plus interest.

**ANNUAL REFUNDS**

NCEA has agreed to provide annual refunds to the Project Participant from amounts available for distribution pursuant to the Indenture. In determining the amount of such refunds, NCEA may reserve such funds as may be required under the terms of the Indenture or as it deems reasonably necessary and appropriate to cover anticipated costs and expenses to be incurred in the next succeeding bond year, with certain limitations.

**COVENANTS OF THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT**

**Operating Expense.** The Project Participant has agreed to make payments under the Commodity Supply Contract from the revenues of its electric utility system as an operating expense of its electric utility system.

**Maintenance of Rates and Charges.** The Project Participant has covenanted and agreed that it will fix, prescribe, maintain, and collect rates, fees, and charges for the electricity or services furnished by its electric utility system so as to provide revenues sufficient to enable it to pay all amounts payable under the Commodity Supply Contract and all other amounts payable from the revenues of the Project Participant’s electric system, and to maintain any required reserves.

**Pledge of Electric System Revenues.** The Project Participant agrees that it will not grant any lien on or security interest in, or otherwise pledge or encumber, the revenues of its electric utility system that would create a lien, pledge or other encumbrance having priority over the obligations of the Project Participant to pay the amounts due to NCEA under the Commodity Supply Agreement.

**Tax-Exempt Status of Bonds.** The Project Participant acknowledges that the Bonds will be issued with the intention that the interest thereon will be exempt from federal taxes under Section 103 of the Code. Accordingly, the Project Participant agrees that it will (a) provide such information with respect to its utility system as may be requested by NCEA in order to establish the tax-exempt status of the Bonds, and (b) act in accordance with such written instructions as NCEA may provide from time to time in order to maintain the tax-exempt status of the Bonds. The Project Participant further agrees that it will not at any time take any action, or fail to take any action, that would adversely affect the tax-exempt status of the Bonds.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Project Participant has further agreed, subject to certain remediation rights, to use the Commodities purchased under the Commodity Supply Contract (a) in a “qualifying use” as defined in the applicable Treasury Regulations, (b) in a manner that will not result in any “private business use” within the meaning of Section 141 of the Code, and (c) in a manner consistent with its Federal Tax Certificate (collectively, the “Qualifying Use Requirements”).

-60-
<!-- Page 1176 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Page)  

Use Requirements due to daily and hourly fluctuations in the Project Participant’s Commodity needs. To the extent the Project Participant does so, the Project Participant shall, to the extent possible, use the proceeds of such remarketing to purchase Commodities (other than Priority Commodities) that the Project Participant uses in compliance with the Qualifying Use Requirements not later than the end of the semi-annual period in which such proceeds were received. To track compliance with these requirements, the Project Participant will provide a semi-annual report to NCEA (delivered not later than the fifteenth day of each April and October until the end of the Delivery Period) showing the following: the total quantity of proceeds from sales of Commodities received under the Commodity Supply Contract that (a) were sold by the Project Participant to any person other than a Municipal Utility and (b) have not been remediated by the Project Participant by applying such proceeds to purchase gas or electricity that is used in compliance with the Qualifying Use Requirements.

**TRANSPORTATION; TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS**

Except as otherwise provided in the Commodity Supply Contract, NCEA must make arrangements for all transportation and transmission services required to effect, and must bear all costs and expenses of, transportation and transmission prior to the delivery of the Contract Quantity at the applicable delivery point specified in the Commodity Supply Contract. The Project Participant must make all arrangements for all transportation and transmission services required to receive the Contract Quantity at such delivery point and to transport it from such delivery point.

Title to the Commodities delivered under the Commodity Supply Contract and risk of loss pass from NCEA to the Project Participant at the applicable delivery point; provided that title and risk of loss for Assigned Gas and Assigned Electricity shall be in accordance with the applicable Gas Assignment Agreement or PPA Assignment Agreement. With respect to gas, NCEA will be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession of gas prior to the time of delivery to the Project Participant at the delivery point, and the Project Participant will be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession of gas thereafter.

**FAILURE TO PERFORM**

Except in the case of a “Force Majeure” event, for each Commodity Unit that NCEA is obligated to deliver to the Project Participant but fails to deliver, NCEA must pay to the Project Participant an amount equal to the difference between the Contract Price per Commodity Unit which would have been applicable to the undelivered Commodity and any higher cost per Commodity Unit which the Project Participant actually incurred to obtain an equivalent quantity of replacement gas or electricity.

In the event that NCEA tenders the Contract Quantity for delivery to the Project Participant and the Project Participant fails to take the full amount of the Contract Quantity (except in the case of a “Force Majeure” event, described below), the Project Participant will remain obligated to pay NCEA the Contract Price for the full amount of the Contract Quantity. NCEA will credit to the Project Participant’s account the net amount described under the heading “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing.”

**REMARKETING OF COMMODITIES**

In the event the Project Participant (a) does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Contract Quantity that it is obligated to purchase under the Commodity Supply Contract as a result of (i)  
-61-

decreased gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period, (ii) decreased demand by the Project Participant’s retail customers or (iii) a change in law, or (b) makes a Remarketing Election for any Reset Period (as described under “THE COMMODITY PROJECT—Re-Pricing Agreement”), NCEA will arrange for the sale by the Commodity Supplier of the affected quantities of Commodities to another Municipal Utility or other purchaser pursuant to the remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement; provided that, in the case of a remarketing request to the Commodity Supplier under clause (a)(iii) above, notice of such a remarketing must be provided at least six months in advance as set forth in the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Supplier must consent to such a remarketing, with such consent to be provided in its sole discretion. Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, NCEA arranges for sales through the Commodity Supplier in accordance with the remarketing provisions and procedures set forth in that agreement. Except in the case of a Remarketing Election given by the Project Participant, if the Commodity Supplier successfully makes such a sale or sales, NCEA must credit, in circumstances described in the Commodity Supply Contract, against the amount owed by the Project Participant for such gas revenues received by NCEA from the sales of such gas less all directly incurred costs or expenses (which include remarketing fees paid to the Commodity Supplier), but in no event more than the Contract Price. If the Project Participant that makes a Remarketing Election in accordance with the provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract, it will have no obligation to purchase or receive Commodities, and NCEA shall have no obligation to sell or deliver Commodities, under the Commodity Supply Contract, during the applicable Reset Period.

See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing” and “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing.”

FORCE MAJEURE

Except with regard to a party’s obligation to make payments under the Commodity Supply Contract that are then due or becoming due with respect to performance prior to the Force Majeure, neither party shall be liable to the other for failure to perform its obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract to the extent such failure was caused by an event of “Force Majeure,” which is defined in the Commodity Supply Contract during the Gas Delivery Period as (i) physical events such as acts of God, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, storms or storm warnings, such as hurricanes, which result in evacuation of the affected area, floods, washouts, explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to machinery or equipment or lines of pipe; (ii) weather related events affecting an entire geographic region, such as low temperatures which cause freezing or failure of wells or lines of pipe; (iii) interruption and/or curtailment of transportation and/or storage by Transporters (provided that if the affected Party is using interruptible or secondary Firm transportation, only if primary, in-path, Firm transportation is also curtailed by the same event, or, if the relevant Transporter does not curtail based on path, if primary Firm transportation is also curtailed); (iv) acts of others such as strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances, riots, sabotage, insurrections, wars or acts of terror; and (v) governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with Law promulgated by a government agency having jurisdiction.

During the Electricity Delivery Period, “Force Majeure” means an event or circumstance which prevents one party from performing its obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract, which event or circumstance was not anticipated as of date of execution of the Commodity Supply Contract, which is not within the reasonable control of, or the result of the negligence of, the party claiming Force Majeure, and which, by the exercise of due diligence, the claiming party is unable to overcome or avoid or cause to be avoided.

-62-
<!-- Page 1178 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  

In addition, any invocation of Force Majeure by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement constitutes Force Majeure under the Commodity Supply Contract.

**DEFAULT AND REMEDIES**

**NCEA Default.** Each of the following events constitute a “NCEA Default” under the Commodity Supply Contract:

(a) any representation or warranty made by NCEA in the Commodity Supply Contract proves to have been incorrect in any material respect when made; or

(b) NCEA fails to perform, observe or comply with any covenant, agreement or term contained in the Commodity Supply Contract, and such failure continues for more than 30 days following the earlier of (i) receipt by NCEA of notice thereof or (ii) an officer of NCEA becoming aware of such default;

**Project Participant Default.** Each of the following events shall constitute a “Project Participant Default” under the Commodity Supply Contract:

(a) the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed to NCEA pursuant to the Commodity Supply Contract and such failure continues for one business day following the earlier of (i) receipt by the Project Participant of notice thereof or (ii) an officer of the Project Participant becoming aware of such default;

(b) the Project Participant’s insolvency or bankruptcy;

(c) any representation or warranty made by the Project Participant in the Commodity Supply Contract proves to have been incorrect in any material respect when made; or

(d) the Project Participant fails to perform, observe or comply with any covenant, agreement or term contained in the Commodity Supply Contract, and such failure continues for more than 15 days following the earlier of (i) receipt by the Project Participant of notice thereof or (ii) an officer of the Project Participant becoming aware of such default.

**Termination.** If at any time an NCEA Default or a Project Participant Default has occurred and is continuing, then the non-defaulting party may do any or all of the following by notice to the defaulting Party specifying the relevant NCEA Default or Project Participant Default, as applicable, terminate the Commodity Supply Contract effective as of a day not earlier than the day such notice is deemed given under the Commodity Supply Contract and/or declare all amounts due to the non-defaulting party under the Commodity Supply Contract immediately due and payable, and the same shall thereupon become immediately due and payable, without notice, demand, presentment, notice of dishonor, notice of intent to demand, protest or other formalities of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by the defaulting party; provided, however, the Commodity Supply Contract will automatically terminate and all amounts due to the non-defaulting party thereunder will immediately become due and payable as of the time immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence of certain events relating to a Project Participant Default described in (b) above. In addition, during the existence of an NCEA Default or

**GENERAL**

SMUD and SFA formed NCEA by their execution of a Joint Powers Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2018 (the “Joint Powers Agreement”). SFA is itself a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and the Modesto Irrigation District in 1992. NCEA has the power, among others, under the Act and the Joint Powers Agreement to take all action necessary or convenient to assist SMUD in the acquisition and financing of supplies of natural gas and electricity.

**GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT**

Under the Joint Powers Agreement, the Board of Directors of SMUD is the governing body (the “Commission”) of NCEA. The current members of the Commission are listed in APPENDIX B under the caption “INTRODUCTION—Independent Governance.” Certain of SMUD’s officers, including its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Controller and Secretary, jointly serve in the same or similar capacities as officers of NCEA. NCEA has no independent employees. The Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of SMUD serves as general counsel to NCEA.

Pursuant to the Joint Powers Agreement, SMUD will provide or cause to be provided such technical and general and administrative services as NCEA may reasonably require. NCEA may reimburse SMUD for its actual costs of providing such services. Although SMUD has provided and will continue to provide NCEA with staffing and consultant support pursuant to the Joint Powers Agreement SMUD does not have any obligation or liability to NCEA beyond that specifically provided in the Joint Powers Agreement and the Commodity Supply Contract. SFA and the Modesto Irrigation District have no obligations or liabilities to NCEA.

**LIMITED LIABILITY**

THE BONDS DO NOT CONSTITUTE A DEBT OR LIABILITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF (INCLUDING THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT), OTHER THAN NCEA, BUT SHALL BE PAYABLE SOLELY FROM THE FUNDS PROVIDED THEREFOR UNDER THE INDENTURE. NCEA SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL OR REDEMPTION PRICE OF OR INTEREST ON THE BONDS, EXCEPT FROM THE FUNDS PROVIDED THEREFOR UNDER THE INDENTURE AND NEITHER THE FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF, INCLUDING NCEA, OR OF THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT IS PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OR REDEMPTION PRICE OF AND INTEREST ON THE BONDS. THE ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS SHALL NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OR CONTINGENTLY OBLIGATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF (INCLUDING THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT) TO LEVY OR TO PLEDGE ANY FORM OF TAXATION OR TO MAKE ANY APPROPRIATION FOR THEIR PAYMENT. NCEA HAS NO TAXING POWER.

**CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING NCEA AND THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT**

**GENERAL**

Various factors will affect the operations of NCEA and Project Participant, including, for example:

- retention of existing customers by the Project Participant;
<!-- Page 1181 -->
- local, regional and national economic conditions;
- the market price of gas, electricity and the market price of alternate forms of energy;
- fuel conservation measures;
- the availability of alternate energy sources;
- climatic conditions;
- government regulation and deregulation of the energy industry;
- federal and state regulation of, and private sector initiatives to limit, greenhouse gas emissions; and
- technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices.

NCEA is unable to predict the impact of the foregoing factors, and other factors, on the Project Participant and their respective gas and electricity system operations. However, the gas and electricity supply and services to be provided by NCEA are intended to maintain and improve the competitive position of the Project Participant by providing them with additional services and competitive prices for a portion of their gas supply.

## DISRUPTIONS IN THE NATURAL GAS MARKET

The Project Participant engages in various transactions in the natural gas markets, including the purchase and sale of natural gas and transactions to hedge their exposure to changes in the market price of natural gas. The ability of the Project Participant to enter into these transactions is dependent upon a variety of factors, including most notably prevailing conditions in the natural gas market.

At various times in the past, the natural gas market experienced severe disruptions, including extremely high and volatile commodity prices, inverted forward price curves and constrained transportation and sources of supply. The factors giving rise to these conditions — demands for gas and other forms of energy, economic conditions, weather patterns, inadequate regulation by federal and state authorities, and the exercise of market power and the manipulation of the gas markets by marketers or others are beyond the control of NCEA and the Project Participant. To the extent that disruptions in the natural gas market prevent the Project Participant from engaging in those transactions that are necessary to enable it to manage risks, its financial and operating position may be adversely affected.

On February 13 through February 17, 2021, a major winter and ice storm had widespread impacts across the central, southeastern and eastern United States, northern Mexico, and parts of Canada (“Winter Storm Uri”), which resulted in electricity blackouts for over 9.9 million people in the United States and contributed to significant shortages of, and substantially increased costs for, natural gas across the United States. [NCEA did not experience any material supply or payment disruptions under its long-term supply and sales contracts due to the events of Winter Storm Uri.]

On February 24, 2022, Russia commenced a military invasion of Ukraine. The invasion, subsequent economic sanctions imposed by nations opposed to the invasion, and reductions and suspensions of Russian gas deliveries impacted global natural gas markets and resulted in significant increases in the market price of natural gas in the United States. While these impacts have subsided, it is not possible to predict the ongoing effects of the continuing military conflict in Ukraine on natural gas markets and gas prices:

# THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT

For information regarding Sacramento Municipal Utility District, see APPENDIX B—INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT.

# CONTINUING DISCLOSURE

NCEA, the Project Participant and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., will enter into a Continuing Disclosure Agreement (the “Undertaking”) for the benefit of the beneficial owners of the Bonds to send certain information annually and to provide notice of certain events to the MSRB’s EMMA system for municipal securities disclosures, pursuant to the requirements of Section (b)(5) of Rule 15c2-12 (“Rule 15c2-12”) adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

A failure by NCEA or the Project Participant to comply with the Undertaking will not constitute an event of default under the Indenture, the Bonds or the Commodity Supply Contract, and Beneficial Owners of the Bonds shall only be entitled to the remedies for any such failure described in the Undertaking. A failure of NCEA or the Project Participant to comply with certain provisions of the Undertaking must be reported in accordance with Rule 15c2-12 and must be considered by any broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer before recommending the purchase or sale of the Bonds in the secondary market. Consequently, such a failure may adversely affect the transferability and liquidity of the Bonds and their market price.

The Undertaking and commitments of NCEA and the Project Participant described under this heading and in APPENDIX E hereto to furnish the above-described documents and information are agreements and commitments solely of NCEA and the Project Participant, and the Underwriter has no responsibility to ensure that NCEA and the Project Participant comply with the Undertaking and such commitments. In addition, the Underwriter makes no representation that any such documents or information will be furnished, or that any such documents or information so furnished will be accurate or complete, or sufficient for the purposes for which they may be used.

NCEA and the Project Participant report that there have been no instances in the five years previous to the date of this Official Statement in which they failed to comply in all material respects with their prior continuing disclosure undertakings pursuant to Rule 15c2-12. [NTD: update/confirm]

NCEA and the Project Participant have adopted a written policy that sets forth procedures for compliance with the federal tax and continuing disclosure requirements applicable to its bonds. The policy includes, among other things, procedures that are intended to promote NCEA and the Project Participant’s compliance with the Undertaking.

<!-- Page 1185 -->
![Tax Matters](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Tax+Matters)

NCEA has furnished to each rating agency expected to rate the bonds being offered certain information, including information not included in this Official Statement, about NCEA and the Bonds. Generally, rating agencies base their ratings on that information and on independent investigations, studies and assumptions made by each rating agency. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. There is no assurance that a rating, once obtained, will continue for any given period of time or that it will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely if, in the opinion of the rating agency, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal could have an adverse effect on the marketability or market price of the Bonds. NCEA has not undertaken any responsibility after issuance of the Bonds to assure the maintenance of the ratings applicable thereto or to oppose any revision or withdrawal of such ratings.

**TAX MATTERS**

**[TBU by Bond Counsel]**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to NCEA (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Code, and the Bonds and interest thereon are exempt from all state, county, municipal and other taxation in the State of California. Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the Bonds included in a financial statement income of certain corporations may be subject to the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in APPENDIX F hereto.

The Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than their principal amount payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier call date) (“Premium Bonds”) will be treated as having amortizable bond premium. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the case of bonds, like the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. However, the amount of tax-exempt interest received, and a Beneficial Owner’s basis in a Premium Bond, will be reduced by the amount of amortizable bond premium properly allocable to such Beneficial Owner. Beneficial Owners of Premium Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in their particular circumstances.

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds. NCEA and SMUD have made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the Bonds. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken), or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds may otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. The nature and extent of these other tax consequences depend upon the particular tax status of the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial Owner’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may cause interest on the Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent Beneficial Owners from realizing the full benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals, clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the Bonds. Prospective purchasers of the Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, and regarding the impact of future legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the Bonds and the issuance of the Bonds, and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend NCEA, SMUD or the Beneficial Owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, parties other than NCEA, SMUD and their appointed counsel, including the Beneficial Owners, would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in connection with an audit examination of tax-exempt bonds is difficult, obtaining an independent review of IRS positions with which NCEA or SMUD legitimately disagrees may not be practicable. Any action of the IRS, including but not limited to selection of the Bonds for audit, or the course or result of such audit, or an audit of bonds presenting similar tax issues, may affect the market price for, or the marketability of, the Bonds, and may cause NCEA, SMUD or the Beneficial Owners to incur significant expense.

Payments on the Bonds generally will be subject to U.S. information reporting and possibly to “backup withholding.” Under Section 3406 of the Code and applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, a non-corporate Beneficial Owner of Bonds may be subject to backup withholding with respect to “reportable payments,” which include interest paid on the Bonds and the gross proceeds of a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of the Bonds. The payee will be required to deduct and withhold the prescribed amounts if (i) the payee fails to furnish a U.S. taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the payor in the manner required, (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect, (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the Code or (iv) the payee fails to certify under penalty of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding under Section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Code. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a Beneficial Owner’s federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

# INTRODUCTION

## General

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) owns and operates an electric system that has provided retail electric service since 1946. SMUD’s current service area is approximately 900 square miles, and includes the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. See “THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM – The Service Area.”

## Independent Governance

SMUD is an independently run community-owned organization. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government.

SMUD is governed by a Board of Directors (the “Board”), which consists of seven directors elected by ward for staggered four-year terms. The Board determines policy and appoints the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, who is responsible for SMUD’s overall management and day-to-day operations. The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager is responsible for the hiring and removal of all employees, other than the Chief Legal and Government Affairs Officer and General Counsel, the Internal Auditor and the Special Assistant to the Board, who are hired and may be removed only by the Board. The employment status of nearly all SMUD employees is governed by a civil service system administered by the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager.

The Board elects its President and Vice President annually to take office in January. The current members of the Board are as follows:

| Name                     | Occupation                                               | Ward  | Term Expires     |

SMUD’s senior management consists of the following executives:

**Chief Executive Officer & General Manager.** Paul Lau was named Chief Executive Officer and General Manager (“CEO & GM”) of SMUD in October 2020. He reports to the SMUD Board of Directors. As CEO & GM, he leads the sixth largest community-owned electric utility in the nation, serving a population of approximately 1.5 million residents and managing a $2.1 billion budget. Mr. Lau previously served as SMUD’s Chief Grid Strategy & Operations Officer and has held several other executive leadership positions during his 42-year career at SMUD. He serves on several national and local boards, including the Large Public Power Council, California Municipal Utilities Association, American Public Power Association, and Smart Electric Power Alliance, and as a Commissioner of the Balancing Authority.

A-1

of Northern California (“BANC”). A registered professional electrical engineer in the State of California (the “State”), Mr. Lau received his bachelor’s degree in electrical power engineering from California State University, Sacramento.

**Chief Customer Officer.** Brandy Bolden reports to the CEO & GM and oversees SMUD’s Customer and Community Services business unit. She is responsible for customer experience delivery across SMUD’s residential and commercial customer segments. She provides leadership and oversight of customer operations including customer care and revenue management, business intelligence, strategic account management, customer experience and segmentation strategy, channel management, customer program and service delivery, and special assistance.

**THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM**

**The Service Area**

SMUD is the primary distributor of electric power within an area of approximately 900 square miles in central California. The service area includes the State Capital, Sacramento, the populous areas principally to the northeast and south of the City of Sacramento (the “City” or “Sacramento”) and the agricultural areas to the north and south. The City is located 85 miles northeast of San Francisco.

SMUD’s electric system supplies power to a population of approximately 1.5 million with a total annual retail load of approximately 10,104 million kilowatt-hours (“kWh”) for the year ended December 31, 2023. As the capital of the nation’s most populous state, Sacramento benefits from the historically stabilizing influence of a large government sector. Sacramento is home to the State government headquarters, the Sacramento County seat, the City government and various special districts that combine to make government the largest single employment sector in the Sacramento area. Information technology, transportation, education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and construction round out the other major sectors of employment and industry in the area.

SMUD’s annual peak load has averaged 3,045 Megawatts (“MW”) over the last three years, with SMUD’s record peak load of 3,299 MW occurring on July 24, 2006. In 2022, SMUD recorded its second highest peak load of 3,263 MW. SMUD reviews its load forecast, at a minimum, on an annual basis.

![The Electric System](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=The+Electric+System)

**The Electric System**

SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities.

SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through a 230 kilovolt (“kV”) and 115 kV transmission system. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) and the Western Area Power Administration (“WAPA”). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system with the exception of the City’s downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission system. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV substations with overhead and underground 12 kV distribution circuits.

**BUSINESS STRATEGY**

**General**

SMUD’s Board of Directors has established the following purpose and vision statements: “SMUD’s purpose is to enhance the quality of life for our customers and community by providing reliable and affordable electricity, and leading the transition to a clean energy future. SMUD’s vision is to be a trusted and powerful partner in achieving an inclusive, zero carbon economy. SMUD will leverage its relationships to accelerate innovation, ensure energy affordability and reliability, protect the environment, eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, catalyze economic and workforce development, promote environmental justice, and enhance community vitality for all.” The Board has adopted a set of Strategic Directions with related metrics, which it considers essential for the success of SMUD and for serving SMUD’s customers. These include competitive rates, access to credit markets, reliability, customer relations, environmental leadership, resource planning, enterprise risk management and safety. Some of the general elements in SMUD’s business strategy are:

- developing and maintaining a sustainable and reliable power supply to meet demand growth consistent with State mandates and the Board’s directions for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions to zero by 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”;
- working closely with customers to provide the information, tools and incentives to assist them to more efficiently manage energy use, which will contribute to meeting greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission targets and managing needle peak demand requirements (those 40 or so hours of the year with extreme temperatures when customer demand surges by up to 400 additional MW);
- managing price, volumetric and credit risks associated with energy and natural gas procurement;
- attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, skilled and engaged workforce that reflects SMUD’s values and is committed to achieving SMUD’s mission;
- retaining local decision making authority and operational independence; and
- collaborating regionally to attract new businesses and grow existing business to diversify and strengthen the Sacramento economy.

SMUD’s long-range business strategy focuses in part on ensuring financial stability by establishing rates that provide an acceptable fixed charge coverage ratio on a consolidated basis, taking into consideration the impact of capital expenditures and other factors on cash flow.

with current energy market prices. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges.”

**Renewable Options.** SMUD’s customers have been increasingly interested in distributed energy resources, mainly through the installation of solar systems. As of December 2023, approximately 51,374 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, approximately 8% of retail customers, had installed solar systems, representing approximately 360 MW of solar installations.

As the cost of energy storage continues to decline, SMUD anticipates an increase in behind-the-meter energy storage, mainly through the installation of battery storage systems. As of December 2023, approximately 1,532 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, had installed storage systems, representing approximately 10 MW of storage.

As another option for solar, SMUD’s SolarShares® pilot program (the “SolarShares Pilot”) was established as a cost-effective and convenient way for commercial customers to meet their energy needs from solar power. The SolarShares Pilot offered SMUD commercial customers the opportunity to receive solar power without upfront costs or equipment installation through 5-, 10- or 20-year purchase contracts. Customers that entered into purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot receive up to half of their power from a utility-scale solar system. SMUD supplies solar power for the SolarShares Pilot either by building and maintaining utility-scale solar systems or by procuring solar power from third parties through power purchase agreements. The SolarShares Pilot generation was approximately 3.2% of retail sales in 2023. As of April 30, 2021, SMUD had completed the SolarShares Pilot and is not entering into new purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot.

Since January 2020, the California Building Code has required all new construction residential buildings under three stories to be powered by photovoltaic solar systems. A new home satisfies this requirement if it installs on-site solar or participates in an approved community solar or energy storage program. In February 2020, SMUD obtained approval from the California Energy Commission (“CEC”) to administer its own community solar program, called Neighborhood SolarShares® (“Neighborhood SolarShares”). SMUD’s Neighborhood SolarShares program can be used by developers of new low-rise residential buildings to satisfy the mandatory solar requirement. See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Rooftop Solar Mandate.” Starting in 2023, the California Building Code’s mandatory solar requirement extends beyond low-rise residential properties, and other changes to the California Building Code’s community solar regulations took effect. SMUD revised its program to align with the new regulations and, in May 2023, obtained approval from the CEC to continue offering its Neighborhood SolarShares compliance option to newly constructed low rise residential homes in its service territory.

In addition to the SolarShares Pilot and Neighborhood SolarShares, SMUD maintains a voluntary green energy pricing program called Greenergy® (“Greenery”). The Greenery program allows customers the opportunity to pay an additional amount per month to ensure that either all or part of their electricity comes from green or carbon free energy sources. In 2023, the program allocated Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) equivalent to approximately 4.2% of retail sales to its participating customers.

**Energy Efficiency.** To further assist customers in managing energy usage and reducing regional carbon emissions and air pollution, SMUD offers an extensive array of energy efficiency and building electrification programs and services including financial incentives, loans, energy audits and education. In addition, SMUD has partnered with local developers to incorporate energy efficiency and all-electric construction measures into new residential and commercial construction, which helps developers plan and design efficient, cost-effective and low or zero-emission buildings. As part of SMUD’s 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), SMUD set a goal for regional carbon emissions through transport and building

# Electrification and Sustainable Power Supply

**Electrification Goals**  
SMUD’s electrification aims to reduce carbon emissions in buildings and transport by 64% over the next 20 years. SMUD’s focus on electrification is continued in the Zero Carbon Plan (defined and discussed below). SMUD was the first electric utility in the country to set its efficiency goals based on carbon reductions, allowing building electrification and energy efficiency to both count toward meeting SMUD’s efficiency goals. This is a significant opportunity, as converting a typical home today to all-electric saves more than three times the carbon emissions compared to doing a major energy efficiency upgrade alone to the same building. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources.”

## Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission

Maintaining a sustainable power supply entails focusing efforts on researching, promoting and implementing new renewable energy technologies and sources to meet SMUD’s long-term commitment to reducing carbon emissions and providing a reliable energy supply. SMUD defines a sustainable power supply as one that reduces SMUD’s GHG emissions to serve retail customer load to zero by 2030. See “– 2030 Zero Carbon Plan” below. SMUD is planning to achieve zero GHG emissions to serve retail customer load through investments in energy efficiency, clean distributed energy resources, renewables portfolio standard (“RPS”) eligible renewables, energy storage, large hydroelectric generation, clean and emissions free fuels, carbon capture and sequestration, and new technologies and business models. Additionally, SMUD plans to continue pursuing GHG emissions reductions through vehicle, building and equipment electrification. At the same time, SMUD’s plans for maintaining a sustainable power supply include assuring the reliability of SMUD’s electric system, minimizing environmental impacts on land, habitat, water and air quality, and maintaining competitive rates relative to other electric providers in the State.

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills regulate GHG emissions and promote the development of sustainable generation alternatives, principally through more stringent RPS. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings” herein.

### 2030 Zero Carbon Plan

In July 2020, the Board declared a climate emergency and adopted a resolution calling for SMUD to take significant and consequential actions to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030. On April 28, 2021, the Board approved SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (the “Zero Carbon Plan”). The Zero Carbon Plan is intended to be a flexible roadmap for SMUD to eliminate carbon emissions from its electricity production by 2030 while maintaining reliable and affordable service. To achieve these goals the Zero Carbon Plan is focused on four main areas: natural gas generation repurposing, proven technologies, new technologies and business models and financial impacts and options. SMUD plans to revisit the Zero Carbon Plan annually.

The natural gas generation repurposing focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for exploring the replacement of two of SMUD’s five Local Gas-Fired Plants (as defined herein) and the retooling of the other three Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” Based on SMUD’s studies to date, SMUD estimates that McClellan (as defined herein) and the Campbell Soup Project (as defined herein) can be replaced in the next several years depending on SMUD’s success with replacement resources. Final decisions about the replacement of these two Local Gas-Fired Plants will be based on additional reliability studies and engagement with the community. As part of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is also exploring converting the Carson Project (as defined herein) and the Procter & Gamble Project (as defined herein) to reliability use operations only and investigating the use of alternative fuels like Renewable Natural Gas-biomethane (RNG-biomanthene), hydrogen and other biofuels for the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, and the Consumers Power Plant (as defined herein). In addition, SMUD is investigating new technologies such as long duration energy storage, carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and other clean fuel alternatives to help support.

**A-9**

The reduction of GHG emissions in SMUD’s energy supply. All final generator configurations are subject to reliability assessments.

The proven clean technologies focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for SMUD to procure approximately 1,100 to 1,500 MW of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (“PV”) generating capacity, 700 to 1,100 MW of local utility-scale battery storage, 300 to 500 MW of wind generating capacity, and 100 to 220 MW of geothermal generating capacity. The Zero Carbon Plan also estimates that customer installation of approximately 500 to 750 MW of behind-the-meter solar PV generating capacity and approximately 50 to 250 MW of behind-the-meter battery storage will assist SMUD with achieving the Zero Carbon Plan goals.

With respect to new technologies and business models, the Zero Carbon Plan focuses on evaluating, prioritizing and scaling the emerging technologies that SMUD expects will have the largest impact on reducing carbon in SMUD’s 2030 resource mix. SMUD is currently focused on various areas of technology and customer-focused programs, including electrification, demand flexibility, virtual power plants, vehicle-to-grid technology, and new grid-scale technologies. The Zero Carbon Plan forecasts that customer-owned devices and SMUD customer-focused programs will contribute between 360 and 1,300 MW of capacity to SMUD’s grid by 2030.

The financial impacts and options focus of the Zero Carbon Plan aims to keep SMUD rate increases at or below the rate of inflation while achieving SMUD’s goal of eliminating carbon emissions from its power supply by 2030. To pay for the expected costs of the Zero Carbon Plan and keep rate increases at or below the rate of inflation, the Zero Carbon Plan estimates the need for SMUD to realize between $50 million and $150 million of sustained annual savings. SMUD currently plans to achieve these sustained annual savings by exploring the implementation of operational savings and pursuing partnership and grant opportunities.

While the ultimate impacts of the Zero Carbon Plan on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy from clean technologies, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers, such impacts could be material.

**Renewable Energy and Climate Change.** The California Renewable Energy Resources Act, established by Senate Bill X1-2 (“SBX1-2”) and the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, enacted by Senate Bill 350 (“SB 350”) require that SMUD meets 33% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2020 and 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2030. Senate Bill 100 (“SB 100”), passed by the legislature and approved by then-Governor Brown on September 10, 2018, accelerates the RPS targets and establishes a new 60% target by 2030. The bill also created a planning goal to meet all of the State’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Renewables Portfolio Standards” for a discussion of the State RPS requirements.

SMUD’s compliance with State RPS requirements is evaluated over 3- or 4-year compliance periods. SMUD met the State RPS requirements for the first compliance period (2011-2013) and second compliance period (2014-2016). The third compliance period (2017-2020) required SMUD to source one-third of its energy from renewable resources, and SMUD had sufficient RECs to meet the third compliance period requirements. SMUD filed its 2020 and third compliance period RPS compliance report with the CEC in the second quarter of 2021 and the CEC adopted SMUD’s third compliance period verification report in December 2023. SMUD expects the confirmation letter from the CEC indicating that SMUD was

in full compliance with its third compliance period RPS obligations in the first quarter of 2024. As of the end of the third compliance period (2020), SMUD had approximately one million surplus RECs available to help meet future RPS targets. SMUD expects to file its 2023 RPS compliance report by July 1, 2024, showing that SMUD will have provided approximately 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources in 2023, which is greater than the interim 2023 RPS target of 41.25%. RPS compliance is determined by compliance period and not by individual years and SMUD anticipates having sufficient surplus procured and/or under contract resources in the fourth compliance period (2021-2024) to be in compliance with the RPS requirements. In addition to meeting RPS standards, SMUD serves an additional 7.4% of its customer load with renewable energy through its voluntary SolarShares and Greenergy pricing programs described above. SMUD estimates that it has sufficient renewable energy deliveries, new power supply contract commitments, new power supply commitments under active discussion, and RPS-eligible surplus carryover to meet its RPS requirements through 2025. Additional resources have been identified that are expected to provide sufficient RPS-eligible resources to cover most of SMUD’s RPS requirements through 2030. Future solicitations may be needed to fill any remaining gaps. The following chart illustrates SMUD’s current RPS requirements through 2030 and its existing and committed resources utilized to meet those requirements.

In addition to procuring new sources, meeting the RPS requirements will require replacement of certain existing renewable contracts which expire in future years. While SMUD anticipates it will meet much of its renewable resource requirements through purchased contracts with third parties, it continues to explore additional options, including wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal developments, partnering with other utilities on future projects, and local development options. SMUD’s resource forecast (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources”) accounts for future renewable resources as a component of “Uncommitted Purchases.” To meet SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan goals, SMUD anticipates meeting loads in 2030 with approximately 70-80% renewable resources, in addition to hydro and other new zero carbon technologies. See “← 2030 Zero Carbon Plan” above.

Given the intermittent nature of power from renewable resources such as wind and solar, SMUD is exploring and investing in options that provide the flexibility to manage the intermittency of such renewable resources. Potential options include energy storage resources, which SMUD has committed to as part of the Zero Carbon Plan, and expanding load management resources. Additionally, on April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its membership in BANC, a joint exercise of powers agency formed in 2009, and currently comprised of SMUD, the Modesto Irrigation District (“MID”), the City of Roseville (“Roseville”), the City of Redding (“Redding”), the City of Shasta Lake and the Trinity Public Utilities District, commenced participation in the California Independent System Operator Corporation (“CAISO”) western energy imbalance market (“WEIM”). Participation in the WEIM benefits SMUD by providing it with broader access to balancing resources within the region to help manage its expanding renewable portfolio. In addition, other entities within the BANC Balancing Authority Area began participation in the WEIM on March 25, 2021. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Operational Independence and Local Control” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

In 2022, SMUD’s Board formally adopted the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan as SMUD’s updated IRP. SMUD filed the approved IRP update with the CEC on September 14, 2022, pursuant to the CEC’s guidelines, which called for updating SMUD’s IRP filing within five years of SMUD’s previous filing of April 29, 2019. SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan built upon the April 2019 IRP and set a goal for zero carbon emissions by 2030. SMUD’s next formal IRP process is expected to be completed and filed with the CEC in 2027. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

The State’s carbon cap-and-trade market established pursuant to Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”) began in 2013. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Greenhouse Gas Emissions” for a discussion of AB 32 and the State’s cap-and-trade program. SMUD anticipates that allowances allocated to SMUD will nearly equal SMUD’s compliance obligations under normal water year conditions. Under low water year conditions, SMUD may need to purchase additional allowances to cover its compliance obligations, including carbon obligations related to wholesale energy sales from SMUD’s natural gas power plants. As SMUD implements its clean power goals, SMUD expects its need for these allowances to decline.

There is scientific consensus that increasing concentrations of GHG have caused and will continue to cause a rise in temperatures in the State and around the world. The change in the earth’s average atmospheric temperature, generally referred to as “climate change,” is, among other things, expected to result in a wide range of changes in climate patterns, including increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including droughts and heat waves, more frequent incidences of wildfires, changes in wind patterns, sea level rise and flooding, any of which alone or in combination could materially adversely affect SMUD’s financial results or operations. See also “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION” and “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY – Other Factors.” As described above, SMUD is actively working to meet its sustainable power supply goals.

reduce its own GHG emissions, and assist the local governments in the territory it serves with their desired GHG reductions. In 2016, SMUD introduced the Pilot Natural Refrigerant Incentive Program, its first customer program providing incentives for GHG reduction in addition to kWh savings. SMUD is a founding member and active participant in the Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative, a public-private partnership formed to better understand and plan for climate impacts expected in the region. SMUD is also an active member of the United States Department of Energy (the “DOE”) Partnership for Energy Sector Climate Resilience. SMUD regularly reviews scientific findings related to climate change and in 2016 published its Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan. In 2024, SMUD is planning to update the Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan along with other climate resiliency actions.

Energy Storage Systems. Assembly Bill 2514 (“AB 2514”) requires the Board to re-evaluate energy storage goals every three years. In compliance with AB 2514, the Board established a target of 9 MW of energy storage procurement by December 31, 2020, which SMUD has procured. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Energy Storage Systems” for further discussion of AB 2514. In September 2020, the Board directed that energy storage forecasts be implemented through SMUD’s IRP process going forward. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” above for a discussion of SMUD’s IRP. SMUD is also evaluating how to couple utility-scale solar with utility-scale storage to support future system reliability needs and enable energy goals.

Meeting Peak Load. A significant consideration for SMUD will be how it addresses its system peak load. SMUD has implemented programs and tools, such as advanced metering, energy efficiency options, and TOD rates for residential customers, to help customers manage their costs while helping SMUD reduce its peak load. Analysis of 2022 data showed a reduction of approximately 108 MW, weather continue to monitor the progress and results of the implementation of TOD rates and will use this information to inform future rate actions and load forecasts. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Time-of-Day Rates.”

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved an optional residential Critical Peak Pricing rate (the “Peak Pricing Rate”), which went into effect June 1, 2022. The Peak Pricing Rate is designed to reduce load by increasing the price of energy when the grid is most impacted, up to 50 hours per summer. In exchange, customers on the rate will receive a per kWh discount on summer Off-Peak and Mid-Peak rates. SMUD is also exploring the use of more distributed energy resources and demand response programs that could further reduce SMUD’s system peak.

Operational Independence and Local Control. A key component of SMUD’s business strategy is focused on maintaining its independence in operating and maintaining its resources. As such, SMUD has taken a number of actions to mitigate the potential impacts of various federal and state regulatory actions. For example, in 2002 SMUD established itself as an independent control area (now termed “Balancing Authority”) within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (“WECC”) region. By removing itself from CAISO’s Balancing Authority area, SMUD became responsible for balancing electric supply and demand within its own service territory. This move substantially reduced fees paid to CAISO, preserved operational flexibility and helped to insulate SMUD from the uncertain regulatory environment and tariff structure of CAISO. In addition to decreased financial risks, this independence also reduced SMUD’s exposure to the impacts of capacity and energy shortages in the CAISO Balancing Authority area. Further, as an independent Balancing Authority, SMUD continued to support the statewide electric grid in events of electrical emergencies requiring rotating outages, such as loss of major transmission lines or equipment, as provided in the statewide emergency plan. By 2006, the SMUD Balancing Authority footprint expanded north to the California-Oregon border and south to Modesto, to include the service areas of the WAPA, MID, Redding and Roseville, and TANC-owned 340-mile 500-kV California-Oregon Transmission Project.

# (“COTP”). 

In October 2009, SMUD, with the coordination and cooperation of WAPA, joined the Western Power Pool Reserve Sharing Group, which supports reliability and reduces operating costs. In May 2011, BANC assumed the role of the Balancing Authority, though SMUD continues to oversee operation of the grid on behalf of BANC. BANC members share cost responsibility for balancing authority-related compliance obligations, liabilities, and operations. BANC also serves as an important venue for SMUD and other BANC members to collaborate with respect to operational and market improvements inside the BANC footprint and to preserve their operational independence. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.” On April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its participation in BANC, began operating in the CAISO WEIM, which helps SMUD better manage the integration of renewable energy resources. The CAISO WEIM is a voluntary market, which allows SMUD to maintain its operational independence from the CAISO, while providing SMUD greater access to balancing resources throughout the western region. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

## Electricity, Natural Gas, and Related Hedging

SMUD continues to utilize a comprehensive and integrated power and fuel supply strategy to acquire a reliable and diversified portfolio of resources to meet existing and future needs. This strategy includes a combination of both physical supply and financial hedging transactions to reduce price risk exposure over a five-year horizon. SMUD’s physical supply arrangements include ownership of power generating resources, as well as a diversified portfolio of power and fuel supply purchase contracts that range in duration, with a mixture of fixed and variable pricing terms.

With regard to the power purchase contracts, SMUD has entered into a series of contracts for the purchase of electricity to meet its resource needs. SMUD also actively manages its exposure on variable rate electricity purchases, and at times may enter into financial contracts to fix prices by using options to reduce price risk, in each case when warranted by economic conditions. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements.”

With regard to fuel supply contracts, SMUD utilizes a similar strategy of employing financial contracts of various durations to hedge its variable fuel supply contracts. As of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply – Supply.”

As provided in SMUD’s natural gas contracts, SMUD may be required to post collateral to various counterparties. As of February 29, 2024, SMUD did not have any collateral posting obligations. A decrease in natural gas prices could result in a collateral posting by SMUD. While the posting of collateral is not an expense for SMUD, it does temporarily encumber unrestricted cash balances.

To hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a pass-through rate component called the Hydro Generation Adjustment (the “HGA”), and established a Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund (the “HRSF”). Similarly, to hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a HGA and established a WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund (“WRSF”). These rate stabilization funds and rate pass through mechanisms help to offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs in years where precipitation levels at SMUD-owned and non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities are low. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

![Managing Risks](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Managing+Risks)

**Managing Risks**  
SMUD maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program, a strategic approach to managing enterprise-wide risks as a portfolio, to help reduce the chance of loss, create greater financial stability and protect SMUD resources. It is designed to maintain an early warning system to monitor changes in, and the emergence of, risks that affect the organization’s business objectives. Under the purview of the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee, composed of executive members and chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, ERM conducts ongoing risk identification, assessments, monitoring, mitigation, risk-based budgeting and reporting. To ensure accountability and oversight, each identified risk is assigned to an executive-level risk owner. Risk status and mitigation efforts are reported monthly to the Board.

**Competitive Challenges**  
In the coming decade, utilities like SMUD may face competition from companies in other industries looking to diversify into the energy sector. Examples of developing competitive areas include retail sale of electricity, distributed electric storage resources, renewable distributed generation (mostly solar in Sacramento), customer installation of fuel cells, third-party electric vehicle charging, home or business automation that enables greater customer participation in energy markets, and third-party provision of energy management software and solutions.

SMUD has a wide range of initiatives to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions and new industry participants. Key areas of focus include:

- **Enhancing customer experience.** Recognizing the importance of meeting customer expectations, SMUD introduced the Customer Experience Strategy in 2016 to provide customers “value for what they pay” and further strengthen customer loyalty. The initiative is focused on ensuring SMUD has the people, systems, technology, programs and services to consistently meet or exceed customers’ changing expectations. The customer experience is measured via surveys with the goal of achieving 80% of customers agreeing that SMUD provides them with value for what they pay by 2030.

- **Restructuring electric rates.** In 2017, the Board approved TOD rates as the standard rate for residential customers. The residential rate transition began in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the full transition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. All of SMUD’s business customers are also on time-based rates. In 2019, the Board approved a restructuring of commercial rates to collect a greater portion of fixed costs through fixed charges and to better align time periods and prices with energy markets. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” and “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

- **Ongoing integrated resource planning.** SMUD monitors and updates its integrated resource planning to ensure future sources of energy balance cost, reliability and environmental requirements with the flexibility to meet challenges of changing market and regulatory conditions, customer energy resources, and emerging technologies.

**Leveraging Core Competencies**  
In addition to these initiatives, SMUD is leveraging core competencies to improve industry safety and help communities serve their customers’ energy needs.

![Sacramento Power Academy](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Sacramento Power Academy.** The Sacramento Power Academy is SMUD’s operational training center providing training support for all of SMUD’s skilled trades professionals. Operating on a 10-acre training facility the academy oversees SMUD’s 14 skilled trades apprenticeships. The academy’s experienced training professionals serve as liaisons and mentors to apprentices progressing through on-the-job training, program testing, night schooling, and extensive training components. The academy also ensures SMUD’s skilled trades professionals are safe and compliant by coordinating and delivering annual regulatory and safety training. The academy is also a workforce development hub utilized by SMUD to increase awareness of and interest in skilled trades careers at SMUD, in SMUD’s community, and in the utility industry.

**Community Energy Services.** In 2002, Assembly Bill 117 was passed to establish Community Choice Aggregation in the State by authorizing Community Choice Aggregators (“CCAs”) to aggregate customer electric load and purchase electricity for customers. SMUD’s Community Energy Services department was established in 2017 to support organizations with values closely aligned with SMUD’s values, while also generating additional revenue for SMUD. CCA programs are proliferating in the State thanks to support for expanding renewable energy use and desire for local control particularly for electricity procurement. There are numerous CCAs operating in the State, and more are anticipated to launch in the future. CCAs are responsible for procuring wholesale power, setting the generation rate, and staffing a call center to handle opt-outs and questions about the power portfolio. The local investor-owned utility (“IOU”) continues to deliver electricity from the electric grid, maintain its electric infrastructure, bill customers and collect payments.

In October 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Valley Clean Energy (“VCE”) to provide technical, energy and support services, including data management and call center services, while also overseeing services and business operations support, to VCE for a term ending in 2023. SMUD and VCE recently executed a new contract for data management, contact center, consulting and debt collection services that expires on December 31, 2028. VCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the City of Woodland, the City of Davis and Yolo County to implement a local CCA program. The service territory expanded to include the City of Winters in 2021. The mission of VCE is to deliver cost-competitive clean electricity, product choice, price stability, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions to its customers in Yolo County. VCE began electric services to its customers in the summer of 2018, giving Yolo County residents a choice between two electricity providers, VCE and PG&E.

In November 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of East Bay Community Energy (“EBCE”) to provide call center and data management services for a three-year term beginning in January 2018. SMUD signed a new contract with EBCE in January 2022 for call center and data management services for an additional three-year term. EBCE recently changed its name to Ava Community Energy (“Ava”). Ava is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro and Union City in Alameda County to implement a local CCA program. Ava expanded its territory to the cities of Pleasanton, Newark, and Tracy in April 2021.

In June 2019, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Silicon Valley Clean Energy (“SVCE”) to provide program services to help local SVCE communities reduce carbon pollution while delivering engaging customer experiences. SVCE programs are focused on grid integration, as well as electrifying transportation, buildings and homes. This contract was extended through September of 2024. In June 2023, SMUD was selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s concierge service vendor for three years. In December 2023, SMUD was again selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s programs administrator for five years. SVCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Campbell, Cupertino, Gilroy, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill,

Mountain View, Saratoga, Sunnyvale and Unincorporated Santa Clara County to implement a local CCA program.

In July 2022, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Marin Clean Energy (“MCE”) to provide data management, billing, data analytic and system assessment services to MCE. MCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2010 and represents 37 member communities across four Bay Area counties: Contra Costa, Marin, Napa and Solano.

In September 2022, SMUD was selected through a competitive process by the governing board of Sonoma Clean Power (“SCP”) to provide market research services to SCP. In January of 2023, SMUD was selected to provide strategic consulting services, providing recommendations related to programs and marketing. SCP is a joint powers agency that serves Sonoma and Mendocino counties.

While CCAs have had success in the State, they are susceptible to business, regulatory and other risks that could lead to a financial loss and/or result in a cessation of operations for the CCA. These risks could extend to a CCA’s counterparties, including SMUD. SMUD has made an effort to identify and mitigate potential counterparty risks to the extent possible in service agreements with the CCAs described above. SMUD may pursue opportunities to provide similar services to additional CCAs in the future. SMUD management does not expect its current arrangements to have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

## FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION

### Precipitation Variability

SMUD uses a precipitation measuring station located at Fresh Pond, California to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s Upper American River Project (the “UARP”) hydropower reservoir. As of January 31, 2024, precipitation at Fresh Pond, California totaled 21 inches for the October-September hydropower water supply period. This is 75% of the 50-year rolling median of 28 inches. Total reservoir storage in the UARP hydropower reservoirs was 238 thousand acre-feet as of January 31, 2024, which was about 63% of capacity and approximately 6% above the historical average. SMUD manages its reservoirs to maximize water storage going into the summer season, which preserves generating capacity during SMUD’s high load months and ensures that SMUD meets its UARP FERC license requirements, including requirements for recreational and environmental flows.

There can be wide swings in precipitation from year to year. In years with below average rainfall, SMUD may have to generate or purchase replacement energy at additional cost. To hedge against variations in the volume of energy received from SMUD-owned UARP hydroelectric resources, SMUD uses the HRSF to help offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

SMUD is also exposed to precipitation variability through its contract with the WAPA. In an average water year this contract provides roughly 661 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of power. WAPA’s actual deliveries are based on hydroelectric generation (minus energy used for pumping) at Central Valley Project reservoirs in Northern California, which varies based on annual precipitation patterns, water deliveries for agriculture, and flow requirements in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Unlike the UARP, SMUD does not monitor precipitation stations to approximate power deliveries under the WAPA contract, and instead relies on a forecast of power deliveries from WAPA. As of January 31, 2024, WAPA has forecasted power deliveries of 703 GWh for 2024, approximately 6% more than an average water year. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration.”

![Wildfires](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Wildfires)

**Wildfires**

**General.** Wildfires in the State have become increasingly common and destructive. Frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased, and could further increase, the possibility of wildfires occurring in areas where SMUD maintains generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The number of diseased and dead trees has increased, and could further increase this possibility. As a result, SMUD faces an increased risk that it may be required to pay for wildfire related property damage or
<!-- Page 1211 -->
![Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory)](https://example.com/image.png)

**Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory).** In 2018, the CPUC approved a new statewide fire map that identifies areas of elevated and extreme wildfire risk from utility-associated assets located throughout the State. SMUD directly participated in the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map. In connection with the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map, a peer review and a team of independent nationwide experts led by Cal Fire affirmed that SMUD’s electric service area is properly located outside of these elevated (“Tier 2”) and extreme (“Tier 3”) high fire threat areas; however, SMUD’s UARP facilities are located within both Tier 2 and Tier 3 areas. According to the CPUC, Tier 2 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an elevated wildfire risk from utility assets and Tier 3 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an extreme risk from utility assets. As of June 8, 2021, approximately 37 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 19 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. SMUD is also a member of TANC. As of July 2022, approximately 116.3 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 4.5 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. In accordance with its FERC license, SMUD adheres to a FERC-approved Fire Prevention and Response Plan for its UARP facilities. On May 17, 2018, in accordance with State law, SMUD’s Board of Directors determined that the UARP area may have a “significant risk of catastrophic wildfire” resulting from overhead electric facilities and that SMUD’s FERC-approved UARP Fire Prevention and Response Plan meets requirements for presenting wildfire mitigation measures to the Board for its approval.

**Wildfire Mitigation.** In response to potential wildfire risk, SMUD has implemented and is continuing to implement a series of measures intended to prevent wildfires from occurring, minimize the spread of any fire that does occur and improve the resiliency of its system. These measures include an increase in the number of inspections for fuel reduction inside and adjacent to rights-of-ways, utilization of Cal Fire-approved equipment and material to reduce the risk of sparking; enhanced inspection and maintenance programs; increased use of ignition reduction techniques, including undergrounding of conductors; increased monitoring of and identified responses to fire conditions, including operational procedures for the de-energization of lines during high fire conditions; and elimination of automatic reclosing on SMUD’s transmission lines and on SMUD’s distribution lines in certain areas during fire season.

SMUD’s proactive approach to vegetation management has been expanded to include the use of advanced technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (“LiDAR”), ortho and oblique imagery that is used to pinpoint tree health and/or condition that may not yet be visible to the naked eye. In addition, SMUD has installed additional weather stations in transmission corridors and substations for increased situational awareness and has continued coordination and collaboration with local agencies and first responders as well as vulnerable populations.

State legislation enacted in 2018 and 2019 (SB 901 and AB 1054, respectively) requires publicly owned utilities (“POUs”) to prepare and present Wildfire Mitigation Plans to their governing boards by January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter. SB 901 requires POUs, including SMUD, before January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, to prepare a wildfire mitigation plan and present it in a public meeting to their governing board. SB 901 requires POU’s to accept comments on the wildfire mitigation plan from the public, other local and State agencies, and interested parties, and to verify that the plan complies with all applicable rules, regulations, and standards, as appropriate. The bill requires a qualified independent evaluator to review and assess the comprehensiveness of its wildfire mitigation plan and present its report to the board in a public meeting. AB 1054 created a new Wildfire Safety Division within the CPUC to prioritize wildfire safety throughout the State, and established an appointed Wildfire Safety Advisory Board (“WSAB”) to advise and make recommendations relating to wildfire safety to this new Division. For POUs, the bill requires submittal of annual wildfire mitigation plans to the WSAB for review and advisory opinions relating to the content and sufficiency of the plans.

A-18
<!-- Page 1212 -->
SMUD assembled an enterprise-wide team of subject-matter experts to prepare its plan in compliance with this legislation. SMUD’s initial Wildfire Mitigation Plan (“WMP”) was adopted by the Board in the fourth quarter of 2019, after circulation for public comment and review of the comprehensiveness of the plan by a qualified independent evaluator. The WMP and evaluator’s report were submitted to the WSAB in 2020.

SMUD reviews its WMP each year, presenting the updated plan to the Board for adoption at duly noticed public meetings. The updated plans and evaluator reports are submitted to the WSAB for advisory opinion and recommendations. SMUD responds to the WSAB’s comments regarding SMUD’s WMP as part of its WMP process. SMUD will continue to annually review and update its WMP, conducting a comprehensive review at least every third year.

SMUD recently completed a comprehensive review and update of its WMP after soliciting public input and independent evaluation. The 2023-2025 WMP was adopted by the Board on June 15, 2023, and duly submitted to the WSAB.

### Wildfire Insurance
Wildfires both in California and nationally have not only increased potential liability for utilities, but have also adversely impacted the insurance markets, leading to higher costs for coverage; coverages becoming prohibitively expensive; limited or restricted coverage to certain types of risks; or coverage at insufficient levels. SMUD most recently renewed its general and wildfire liability insurance coverage on June 15, 2023, increasing the coverage limit by $25 million to $275 million. SMUD increased the commercially insured portion of its wildfire coverage program from $176 million to $212.5 million and maintained the self-insured layers and quota share portions of the coverage at $6.5 million.

In addition, it is expected that SMUD will have a portion of the $500 million aggregate limit of its commercial paper and line of credit program to provide operational flexibility in the event of the occurrence of a wildfire or other operational event. However, SMUD has not covenanted to maintain the availability of the commercial paper program and line of credit program for these purposes and no assurances can be given that the commercial paper and line of credit program will be available at the time of, or during, such an event.

### August 2020 Heat Wave
The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from August 14, 2020 through August 18, 2020. The CAISO was forced to institute rotating electricity outages in the State during this extreme heat wave. SMUD, as a member of BANC, and being outside of the CAISO did not have to implement any planned power disruptions. Additionally, SMUD was able to support the CAISO during some hours of the heat wave with both requested emergency assistance and wholesale market sales. SMUD’s peak demand between August 14, 2020 and August 18, 2020, varied between 2,874 MW and 3,057 MW, well below SMUD’s record peak of 3,299 MW.

### September 2022 Heat Wave
The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from September 5, 2022 through September 8, 2022. On September 6, 2022, SMUD experienced its second highest peak demand of 3,263 MW. SMUD did not have to implement any planned power disruptions.

### Storm Damage
In January 2023, SMUD experienced a series of winter storms that brought heavy rains and high winds causing damage to SMUD’s grid and widespread outages for SMUD’s customers. By the time the

A-19

**storm response was complete, SMUD had experienced the largest mobilization of personnel and restoration crews in its history. SMUD incurred costs related to removing downed trees, restoring power from downed poles and broken lines, replenishing inventory, communicating with and providing assistance to customers, maintaining IT systems, and coordinating with local emergency agencies. SMUD is pursuing claims with Federal and State agencies to attempt to recover certain of SMUD’s costs related to the storms. The material financial impacts have been reflected in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, [which are included in APPENDIX B].**

**Cosumnes Power Plant Outage**

On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant (as defined herein) was shut down due to a ground fault in the Steam Turbine Generator (“STG”) stator. The ground fault was caused by delamination of the insulation on one of the through bolts. Damage from the ground fault resulted in a full rewind and restack of the stator core, replacement of all stator through bolts, and a full rewind of turbine rotor. The Cosumnes Power Plant repairs were completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. During the extended outage, SMUD shifted generation to the other local gas-fired plants and the Sutter Energy Center and procured additional energy and resource adequacy capacity. SMUD also requested and received approval from the California Air Quality Board and California Energy Commission to operate one or both of the gas turbines without the STG. During the September 2022 heatwave, both of the gas turbines at the Cosumnes Power Plant were operated without the STG, providing 270 MW at peak.

To mitigate the financial impact of unplanned outages from its thermal assets, SMUD carries commercial property insurance with a business interruption endorsement. At the time of the loss, the coverage provided up to $30.8 million of business interruption recovery per month at the Cosumnes Power Plant, with a sub-limit of $310 million over any 18-month period. During the period of loss, claims were subject to a $5 million equipment damage deductible and a 60-day business interruption claims waiting period.

SMUD has settled the equipment damage portion of the loss for $18.6 million, resulting in a $13.6 million recovery. The business interruption portion of the claim remains in process, with SMUD receiving a $50 million advance in December of 2022. As of January 2024, the carriers have confirmed an additional $51 million in undisputed recovery, which is anticipated to be received in the first quarter of 2024. Thus far, SMUD has recovered $114.6 million of the loss and will continue to work toward full settlement of the disputed portion of the claim, which is approximately $68 million.

**Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic**

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD has lessened since the height of the pandemic in 2020, SMUD is still experiencing impacts from the pandemic. However, compared to weather adjusted load levels, SMUD’s overall load is near or above pre-pandemic levels.

Part of the governmental response to the economic consequences of the pandemic required utility providers (including SMUD) to provide additional grace periods and flexible payment plans for the payment of utility bills or to refrain from pursuing collection remedies for unpaid bills for a period of time. SMUD also implemented a no-shutoff policy through January 2022 under which SMUD did not disconnect power to a customer for non-payment of their electric bill. Beginning in February 2022, SMUD resumed its normal payment, late fee, and disconnection process and began disconnections of unpaid accounts in late April 2022. As a result, SMUD has experienced an increase in delinquencies for customer electric accounts versus pre-pandemic levels. In December 2021, SMUD received $41 million from the California Arrearage Payment Program (“CAPP”) initial funding, and an additional $9.9 million in 2022. All funds were applied to delinquent balances. As of December 31, 2023, the total delinquencies for customer electric

**A-20**

accounts were $38.2 million, after the CAPP credit, which is an increase from the February 2020 balance of total delinquencies for customer electric accounts of $16.9 million. The financial impacts stemming from delinquent accounts have been accounted for in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the preceding years. Any successful recovery of delinquent accounts will contribute to an increase in net income.

SMUD also paused the recertification process for existing customers in SMUD’s low-income discount program during the pandemic. The number of customers participating in the low-income assistance program increased by 16,407, or approximately 22% from February 2020 to December 2023. SMUD has resumed the recertification process for existing customers in the low-income discount program in 2023.

While the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD have lessened, if the pandemic and its consequences again become more severe or another similar event occurs, the impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations could be material.

## RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE

### Rates and Charges

SMUD’s Board of Directors has autonomous authority to establish the rates charged for all SMUD services. Unlike IOUs and some other municipal utility systems, retail rate and revenue levels are not subject to review or regulation by any other federal, State or local governmental agencies. Changes to SMUD rates only require formal action by the Board of Directors after two public workshops and a public hearing. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government. SMUD typically reviews and sets rates on a two-year cycle.

### 2019 Rate Action.

On June 24, 2019, the Board approved a 3.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2020, a 3.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2020, a 2.50% rate increase effective January 1, 2021, and a 2.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2021, for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved a restructuring of the commercial rates, including new time periods and an overall increase in the fixed bill components, such as the System Infrastructure Fixed Charge and demand charges, and a corresponding decrease in energy charges, making the restructuring revenue neutral by rate category. To minimize bill impacts, rate categories will be restructured over an eight-year period.

### 2021 Rate Action.

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved a 1.5% rate increase effective March 1, 2022 and a 2.0% rate increase effective January 1, 2023 for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved the Solar and Storage Rate, the optional residential Peak Pricing Rate, and updates to certain schedules of SMUD’s Open Access Transmission Tariff (“OATT”). The Board also approved a new timeline for the commercial rate restructure transition, and all impacted commercial customers were transitioned to the new rates by the end of the first quarter of 2022.

SMUD also implemented a solar interconnection fee based on the size of solar interconnection and supporting programs such as battery incentives, incentives to enroll in SMUD’s Peak Pricing Rate, battery incentives for Virtual Power Plants, and a program to bring the benefits of solar to under-resourced multi-family communities. These programs and fees are not subject to Board approval.

![2023 Rate Action](https://example.com/image.png)

**2023 Rate Action**

On September 21, 2023, the Board approved a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2025, and a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2025 for all customer classes. The Board also approved establishing the Energy Assistance Program Rate (“EAPR”) Rate Stabilization Fund, which will provide an additional discount to those low-income customers with the greatest need. The discount will be funded with discretionary, non-retail rate revenue, as to not have an impact on any future required rate changes. There is currently pending litigation concerning the adoption of the 2023 rates. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”

**Rate Stabilization Funds**

The Rate Stabilization Fund (“RSF”) is maintained by SMUD to reduce the need for future rate increases when costs exceed existing rates. At the direction of the Board, amounts may be either transferred into the RSF (which reduces revenues) or transferred out of the RSF (which increases revenues). The Board authorizes RSF transfers on an event driven basis. The RSF includes funds to hedge variations in the volume of energy received from WAPA hydroelectric generation, variation in AB 32 revenue and variations in Low Carbon Fuel Credit (“LCFS”) revenue. As of December 31, 2023, the balance in the RSF was $115.8 million, which is approximately 7.2% of annual retail revenue.

Effective July 2008, SMUD implemented the HGA, which is a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from the UARP (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric”). The HGA is designed to increase the deposits to the HRSF in wet years when SMUD has more hydroelectric generation than expected. Each year SMUD determines the impact of precipitation variances on projected hydroelectric generation from the UARP. When the precipitation variance results in a deficiency of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, transfers from the HRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is zero. When the precipitation variance results in a projected surplus of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, deposits will be made into the HRSF in an amount approximating the positive impact to SMUD from the surplus hydroelectric generation (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is not sufficient to cover transfers that would otherwise be made in the event of a projected deficiency in UARP hydroelectric generation, a 12-month HGA surcharge will automatically be included on customers’ electric bills at a level that generates up to 4% of retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue on any precipitation variance calculation date and the precipitation variance results in a projected UARP hydroelectric generation surplus, the positive impact of the surplus may be used for other purposes at staff’s recommendation, with the approval of the Board, including returned to customers through an electric bill discount up to 4% of retail revenue. SMUD calculates HRSF transfers based on an April-March (water year) precipitation period at Fresh Pond, California. This precipitation station is used to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s UARP hydropower reservoirs. As of January 31, 2024, and based on the current HRSF water year precipitation forecast, SMUD anticipates transferring $20.8 million out of the HRSF in April 2024.

In September 2023, SMUD added a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from WAPA. Each year SMUD determines the WAPA Energy Delivery Variance (“EDV”) based on forecasted energy delivery minus the actual energy delivery. When the EDV variance is positive, transfers from the WRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 2% of cash).

**Low-Income Discount**

As of December 2023, approximately 91,407 customers received the low-income discount offered by SMUD, which represents approximately 16% of all residential customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, SMUD suspended recertification during the pandemic. In 2023, the total discount was approximately $32.7 million. As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn, SMUD experienced an increase in low-income discount applicants. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

While the low-income discount has provided substantial benefits to low-income customer bills for years, multiple economic variables, such as inflation and rate increases, have had disproportionately negative impacts on low-income customers, particularly those in the 0-50% Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”). In 2023, SMUD established an EAPR Rate Stabilization Fund (“ERSF”) to provide an additional discount to the electricity usage charge up to an established maximum discount (“ERSF Additional Discount”) for customers in the 0-50% FPL. The ERSF is funded by discretionary non-retail rate revenue, reviewed on an annual basis, and the specific monthly ERSF Additional Discount is set before the year the value is in effect. SMUD expanded its programs and services starting in 2016 to help customers with energy assistance, home improvement packages, and education. SMUD is creating tailored solutions to best meet the needs of low-income customers. These solutions include free solar panels and inspecting homes to identify energy saving and fuel switching opportunities. As of December 2023, SMUD has performed 30,000 energy retrofits and, in partnership with Grid Alternatives (a non-profit organization that focuses on implementing solar power and energy efficiency for low-income families), 230 customers have benefited from free solar installations. Forty-eight additional homes received solar and energy efficiency through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento. As part of SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan and the focus on building electrification, SMUD has also been ramping up electrification investments for low-income customers. Additionally, since 2019, SMUD has assisted more than 2,600 households with electrification upgrades. Additionally, SMUD has installed nearly 450 electric vehicle chargers and more than 400 electric vehicle circuits in low-income households or areas that serve low-income customers.

# Customer Base; Largest Customers

A stabilizing influence on SMUD’s revenues is that a substantial proportion is derived from residential customers (49.2% in 2023). Historically, revenue from commercial and industrial consumption has been more sensitive to economic fluctuation. Furthermore, SMUD has no dominant customers that account for a significant percentage of annual revenues. In 2023, no single customer contributed more than 3% of revenues. The top ten customers generated approximately 9% of revenues and the top 30 generated approximately 15% of revenues. The following table presents information on SMUD’s top ten customers as of December 31, 2023.

# Power Generation Facilities

## Hydroelectric
The UARP consists of three relatively large storage reservoirs (Union Valley, Loon Lake and Ice House) with an aggregate water storage capacity of approximately 400,000 acre-feet and eight small reservoirs. Project facilities also include eight tunnels with a combined length of over 26 miles and eight powerhouses containing 11 turbines. In addition to providing clean hydroelectric power and operating flexibility for SMUD, the UARP area provides habitat for fish and wildlife and a variety of recreational opportunities, including camping, fishing, boating, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and cross-country skiing.

The combined capacity of the UARP is approximately 685 MW at SMUD’s load center in Sacramento. Under current licensing and mean water conditions, these facilities are expected to generate approximately 1,600 GWh of electric energy annually, which represents approximately 15% of SMUD’s current average annual retail energy requirements. In 1957, the Federal Power Commission (predecessor agency to FERC) issued a license to SMUD for the UARP. This 50-year license was subsequently amended to add and upgrade facilities and now includes all segments of SMUD’s hydroelectric facilities located on the South Fork of the American River and its tributaries upstream from the Chili Bar Project (described below). On July 23, 2014, FERC issued to SMUD a new 50-year license for the UARP.

On November 9, 2016 FERC issued an Order authorizing SMUD to construct the South Fork Powerhouse downstream of the UARP’s Slab Creek Dam. Construction was substantially completed in the fall of 2020, and the new powerhouse was placed into operation on October 25, 2022, adding 1.8 MW of generation to the UARP’s overall capacity.

On June 16, 2021, pursuant to Board authorization, SMUD acquired the Chili Bar Hydroelectric Project which consists of a 7 MW powerhouse, reservoir, dam and spillway, north of Placerville on the South Fork of the American River for approximately $10.4 million (the “Chili Bar Project”). The Chili Bar Project is immediately downstream from the UARP and operates as the regulating reservoir for the UARP’s largest powerhouse. Owning the UARP and the Chili Bar Project enables SMUD to operate the two projects with a holistic approach to license compliance and generation efficiency.

## Solano 2 Wind Project
SMUD owns and operates an 87 MW wind project, located in Solano County, known as Solano 2. Solano 2 consists of 29 wind turbine generators (“WTGs”) rated at 3.0 MW. Energy from the project is collected at 21 kV and transmitted over a dedicated 3-mile overhead system to the SMUD-owned Russell substation. At the Russell facility, the energy is transformed to 230 kV and interconnected to PG&E’s Birds Landing Switching Station. Energy deliveries are scheduled through the CAISO.

## Solano 3 Project
In 2011 and 2012, SMUD constructed a 128 MW wind project adjacent to Solano Phase 2, known as Solano 3. The Solano 3 project consists of 31 WTGs rated at 1.8 MW and 24 WTGs rated at 3.0 MW. The project interconnects through a 34.5 kV underground collection system to the Russell substation. Like the Solano Phase 2 project, this energy is transformed to 230 kV and delivered through the CAISO.

## Solano 4 Project
SMUD has developed the Solano 4 Wind Project on land with a wind easement owned by SMUD near the Solano 3 project, known as the Collinsville and Roberts properties, to install 10 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW, and to remove the Solano 1 turbines and replace them with 9 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW. SMUD has met all of the CAISO requirements and has executed a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement (“GLIA”) as of June 2021 that will allow for 90.8 MW of capacity at the point of interconnection. In April 2021, SMUD submitted an application for advisory review by the Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (the “Solano ALUC”) of the Solano 4 Wind Project’s consistency. 

A-29

with the 2015 Travis Air Force Base Land Use Compatibility Plan (the “Travis Plan”). In May 2021, the Solano ALUC purported to resolve that the Solano 4 Wind Project was inconsistent with the Travis Plan. In August 2021, the Board approved the Project Environmental Impact Report, made findings overriding the Solano ALUC’s finding of inconsistency, made findings there was no alternative to the project, and approved the Solano 4 Wind Project. In September 2021, Solano County filed a writ petition challenging SMUD’s approval of the Solano 4 Wind Project based on procedural environment, zoning and land use grounds. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 14, 2022, and the suit was dismissed on January 10, 2023. The settlement agreement allows for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project as planned.

In addition, SMUD applied for and obtained extensions of the Federal Aviation Administration Determinations of No Hazard allowing for construction of the turbines. A contract for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project was awarded to Vestas Corporation and the Solano 4 Wind Project is currently under construction. The expected operation date for the Solano 4 Wind Project is May 2024. PG&E identified upgrades needed to interconnect the Solano 4 Wind Project that will not be complete before the expected Solano 4 commercial operation date. PG&E has an approved project and expects to complete the needed upgrades by May of 2025. Realization of the full capacity of the Solano 4 Wind Project may be delayed into the second quarter of 2025 due to the timeframe established for the PG&E required transmission upgrades. SMUD has developed a mitigation plan for the limited interconnection capacity for the first year of operation, in coordination with CAISO and PG&E, of using all of the existing SMUD Solano Russell substation interconnection capacity combined for the dispatch of all the Solano Wind Project. SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process, which combines all phases of the Solano Wind Project so it may operate as one project. This was fully executed by SMUD, CAISO, and PG&E on February 27, 2023.

As of the end of 2023, all of the turbine site delivery roads and foundations for the Solano 4 Project have been completed, all of the turbine components have been delivered to the Solano 4 Project site and 10 of the Solano 4 Project turbines have been fully erected.

At the completion of the Solano 4 project, SMUD will have an installed wind capacity of 303 MW in connection with the overall Solano Wind Project, leaving 18 MW at the point of interconnection for future development.

**Distributed Solar Photovoltaic.** SMUD owns and operates approximately 2 MW of solar photovoltaic generating facilities. These facilities include installations at the Hedge Substation property, SMUD Headquarters, the East Campus Operations Center, and other smaller photovoltaic systems throughout the service area on parking lots.

**Hedge Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 4 MW, 8 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached commercial operation in January 2023.

**ESS Flow Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 0.45 MW, 3 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached test operation in September 2023, and commercial operation is planned for March 2024.

**Local Gas-Fired Plants.** SMUD constructed five local natural gas-fired plants in its service area: the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, the Campbell Soup Project, McClellan and the Cosumnes Power Plant (each defined below). These five plants are referred to collectively as the “Local Gas-Fired Plants.” These plants are a strategic component of SMUD’s resource mix. In addition to providing SMUD a total capacity of approximately 1,139 MW, the Local Gas-Fired Plants provide SMUD with needed

**A-31**

**Local Gas-Fired Plants Overview**

SMUD has entered into long-term agreements with SFA providing for the purchase by SMUD of all of the power from each of the Local Gas-Fired Plants on a take-or-pay basis. This consolidation created operational and administrative efficiencies without changing any of the functionality of the power plants. Although the Local Gas-Fired Plants are owned by SFA, SMUD has exclusive control of their dispatch and manages their operations as part of its overall power supply strategy.

Payments under the power purchase agreements are payable from the revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of the principal of or interest on SMUD’s Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the caption “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below), as are other maintenance and operation costs and energy payments. For further discussion of SMUD’s obligations to make these payments to SFA, see “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Joint Powers Authorities.”

**Description of the Five Local Gas-Fired Plants:**

1. **The Cosumnes Power Plant (the “Cosumnes Power Plant”)**  
   The Cosumnes Power Plant is a 612 MW natural gas-fired, combined cycle plant located in the southern portion of Sacramento County adjacent to SMUD’s decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant. Commercial operation of the Cosumnes Power Plant commenced on February 24, 2006. SFA increased the net generating capacity of the facility by 81 MWs via an Advanced Gas Path (“AGP”) upgrade. The additional AGP generation was realized after hardware and software upgrades were completed. The Cosumnes Power Plant is owned by SFA, a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and MID. The existing take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA expires no earlier than when the related bonds have been paid in full (the outstanding related bonds are scheduled to mature on July 1, 2030). On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant was shut down due to a ground fault in the STG stator. The repair was completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Cosumnes Power Plant Outage”.

2. **The Carson Cogeneration Project (the “Carson Project”)**  
   The Carson Project, a 103 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project consisting of separate cycle and peaking plants, provides steam to the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) wastewater treatment plant adjacent to the site. The Carson Project was originally owned by the Central Valley Financing Authority (“CVFA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and the SRCSD. Construction of the Carson Project was completed and the plant began commercial operation on October 11, 1995. The CVFA bonds issued to finance the Carson Project were defeased in September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Carson Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

3. **The Procter & Gamble Cogeneration Project (the “Procter & Gamble Project”)**  
   The Procter & Gamble Project, a 182 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, is located in an established industrial area of Sacramento. The initial combined cycle portion of the plant began commercial operation on March 1, 1997. Construction of the peaking plant portion of the Procter & Gamble Project commenced during 2000 and the unit achieved commercial status on April 24, 2001. The Procter & Gamble Project produces steam for use in Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company’s oleochemical manufacturing processes and electricity for sale to SMUD. The Procter & Gamble Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Cogeneration Authority (“SCA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA, a separate joint powers authority. The SCA bonds issued to finance the Procter & Gamble Project were defeased in
<!-- Page 1225 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Procter & Gamble Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Procter & Gamble Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

**The Campbell Soup Cogeneration Project (the “Campbell Soup Project”).** The Campbell Soup Project, a 170 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project, was completed and began commercial operations on December 4, 1997. Upgrades were implemented during 2000, which increased the plant’s peaking capacity to 180 MW, well above its net demonstrated capacity of 159.8 MW. The plant is located in south Sacramento adjacent to the Capital Commerce Center (formerly the Campbell Soup Company food processing facility). The Campbell Soup Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Power Authority (“SPA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA. The SPA bonds issued to finance the Campbell Soup Project were redeemed in July 2015. In late 2021, ownership of the Campbell Soup Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Campbell Soup Project (the “Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA”) covers both the Campbell Soup Project and McClellan and will be in effect until terminated by SMUD. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing the Campbell Soup Project in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**The McClellan Gas Turbine (“McClellan”).** McClellan is a 72 MW natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine generating plant at McClellan Business Park in Sacramento. This turbine is connected to SMUD’s electric system and is operated to meet SMUD’s peak-load requirements. McClellan is aligned for remote starting and operation with black start and fast start capabilities. SMUD constructed the McClellan unit in 1986 as a 50 MW emergency power source for the McClellan Air Force Base. In 2001, following the closure of the Air Force base, McClellan was repurposed for SMUD’s use. In May 2007, SMUD transferred ownership of McClellan to SPA for more efficient operation. SPA did not issue debt related to McClellan. In late 2021, ownership of McClellan was transferred to SFA. SFA pays all costs of operations and maintenance through to SMUD in accordance with the terms of the Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA. In exchange for paying all costs related to McClellan, SMUD receives all of the power generated thereby on a take-or-pay basis. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing McClellan in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**Fuel Supply**

**General.** SMUD is obligated to arrange for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Management of the natural gas procurement and delivery process is a key focus of SMUD’s reliability and risk policies. Although the natural gas consumption of the power plants for SMUD’s load can vary significantly depending on the season, precipitation, and the market price of power and natural gas, the plants are forecasted to need, on average in 2024, a total of approximately 91,000 Decatherms per day (“Dth/day”) with a daily peak slightly more than 171,000 Dth/day of natural gas. SMUD has implemented a comprehensive strategy to secure a reliable and diversified fuel supply through a variety of agreements for the supply, transportation, and storage of natural gas.

**Supply.** SMUD hedges a significant portion of its expected gas needs to meet customer power requirements. This includes gas for the Local Gas-Fired Plants and for the Sutter Energy Center. See “Power Purchase Agreements – Sutter Energy Center”. This is accomplished through a combination of long-term supply arrangements and an exposure reduction program. The program consists of a primarily rolling three-year exposure reduction component, a fuel hedging component on a rolling three-year basis, as well as supplemental fixed calendar year components reaching out up to five calendar years. Long-term

A-32

arrangements may consist of a combination of physical commodity supply contracts, financial hedges, or options. Natural gas is purchased from a wide variety of producers and marketers at the northern and southern California borders, and from the San Juan and the Rocky Mountain supply basins. SMUD has a number of both fixed-price supply agreements and financial hedging contracts to fix gas costs ranging from one month to several years in duration. Including fixed price biogas contracts as of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted.

SMUD has contracted with NCGA to purchase an approximate average of 8,700 Dth/day over the remaining life of a contract expiring May 31, 2027 (the “NCGA Contract”). Under the NCGA contract, SMUD pays a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. Until November 1, 2023 the delivery point for the NCGA Contract was the AECO hub in Alberta. Starting November 1, 2023, to increase delivery efficiencies, SMUD has exchanged the gas delivered at the AECO hub under the NCGA Contract with gas delivered at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border. From there SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants.

SMUD has also contracted with NCEA to purchase an approximately 22,000 Dth/day on average, or to be converted to the appropriate cash flow value in Megawatt-hours (“MWh”) of electricity over the remaining life of a contract expiring on May 31, 2049. The gas will be delivered to the SMUD system via the Malin receipt point on the PG&E backbone system. SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants. SMUD will pay a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. In connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement), SMUD expects to amend and restate the contract with NCEA in connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement.) [adjust for 2024 Senior Bonds offering documents]

**Renewable Natural Gas Supply.** As a component of meeting SMUD’s RPS goals, SMUD procures renewable natural gas and digesters gas as fuels to generate renewable electricity from the Cosumnes Power Plant. Descriptions of the renewable natural gas supply agreements are provided below.

In March 2009, SMUD entered into a 15-year contract (that qualifies as renewable energy) with Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (“Shell Energy”) to purchase up to 6,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from a landfill project in Texas. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in April 2009. In March 2012, SMUD amended the contract with Shell Energy to increase the maximum volumes to 7,300 Dth/day and extended the term by 10 years to March 31, 2034. Currently, the delivery point is PG&E Topock and SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In 2016, SMUD entered into a 3-year contract with Shell Energy to sell back the entire volume of renewable natural gas purchased, less 500 Dth/day, to be sold into the vehicle transportation markets. Upon expiration of the initial 3-year contract for the sale of biogas to Shell Energy, SMUD extended the sell back of the entire volume of biogas twice for an additional three years with Element Markets (now RNG, LLC), starting in 2020 and 2023. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

SMUD contracted with Heartland Renewable Energy, LLC (“HRE”) in December 2009 for a 20-year supply of up to 7,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas from a digester facility in Colorado. Deliveries began in March of 2014. Currently, the delivery point is Opal, Wyoming and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. HRE has not delivered volumes from the project to SMUD since December 2016 due to litigation with Weld County, Colorado regarding odor and
<!-- Page 1227 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

permit issues. EDF Renewables, the majority owner of HRE, notified SMUD in August of 2017 that it is in discussions with a short list of bidders to sell its interests in the facility. In June of 2020, the project was purchased and SMUD’s contract was assigned to the new owner, Platte River Biogas, LLC (“PRB”). SMUD and PRB reached a settlement in the third quarter of 2021 that could lead to terminating the contract.

In September 2011, SMUD and CVFA entered into a “Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement” through which the Carson Project cleans nearly all of the digester gas received from Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) and sells it to SMUD for delivery to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In return, SMUD pays all of the Carson Project’s costs in acquiring, cleaning and making the gas available to SMUD. The Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement expires in September 2025. In late 2021, the Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, along with the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The Carson Project is currently receiving, processing and selling up to 1,500 Dth/day with provisions for volume increases over time to 2,500 Dth/day. Digester gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations.

In December 2011, SMUD entered into a 20-year agreement with EIF KC Landfill Gas LLC (“EIF”) to purchase up to 7,050 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from multiple landfill projects. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in January 2014. Currently the delivery point is Kern River – Opal and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. Renewable natural gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations. In April 2022, SMUD entered into a transaction to sell the renewable natural gas purchased into the renewable transportation markets. The transaction expires in March 2025. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

AB 2196 is a law that defines the criteria by which existing and future renewable natural gas contracts will qualify for the State RPS program. The CEC adopted a RPS Eligibility Guidebook on April 30, 2013, which includes detailed rules for implementation of AB 2196. SMUD received an updated certificate of eligibility from the CEC in July 2014 for the Cosumnes Power Plant that included the quantities of renewable natural gas from all contracts. The CEC adopted a revised RPS Eligibility Guidebook (Ninth Edition) on April 27, 2017. This latest guidebook did not change the RPS eligibility of any of the above SMUD renewable natural gas and digester gas contracts, but did simplify reporting requirements for these contracts.

Gas Transmission

SMUD has satisfied its obligation to deliver natural gas to its power plants by constructing a natural gas pipeline, purchasing an equity interest in two PG&E backbone gas transmission lines, and contracting for capacity on a number of existing interstate natural gas transmission lines.

The Local Pipeline. SMUD constructed and owns a 20-inch, 50-mile natural gas pipeline in the greater Sacramento area (the “Local Pipeline”) that transports gas to all of the Local Gas-Fired Plants except McClellan. The Local Pipeline is interconnected with PG&E’s major State gas transmission lines 300 and 401. Additionally, it may be interconnected with one or more private gas gathering pipelines located in the area, a gas storage project and/or other FERC approved pipelines that may be built in the local area. In conjunction with the construction of the Cosumnes Power Plant, SMUD extended the Local Pipeline to the plant site. The 26-mile extension was completed in 2004. The extension is 24 inches in diameter and was designed to serve both the Cosumnes Power Plant and an additional second phase, if constructed.

![PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=PG%26E+Backbone+Gas+Transmission+Lines+300+and+401)

**PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401.** In 1996, SMUD purchased an equity interest in PG&E’s backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 (referred to as the PG&E backbone). The total capacity acquired at that time was approximately 85,000 Dth/day and consisted of approximately 43,600 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, Oregon and 44,700 Dth/day from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California. SMUD was also entitled to a share of non-firm capacity, which was approximately 4,360 Dth/day; making the total capacity potentially available to SMUD almost 90,000 Dth/day. This purchase made SMUD a co-owner of the PG&E backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 and obligated SMUD to pay PG&E to operate the pipelines on its behalf subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and operating protocols. PG&E reduced operating pressures on Line 300 after PG&E suffered a natural gas explosion in San Bruno, CA in September of 2010. Operating pressures and capacity may also fluctuate due to regulatory and other changes. As of December 1, 2021, SMUD holds a total capacity of approximately 87,000 Dth/day, consisting of approximately 47,572 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, and 39,193 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California.

**Kern River Gas Transmission Company Long Term Agreement.** SMUD has an agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company for 200,000 Dth/day of firm capacity through April 30, 2028. This capacity gives SMUD access to the Rocky Mountain supply basin at Opal, Wyoming, and connects to PG&E Line 300 (owned in part by SMUD) at Daggett, California.

SMUD’s diversified portfolio of gas transmission arrangements allows for the purchase of gas from a variety of suppliers and locations, and the opportunity to capitalize on regional price differentials where possible. In addition, it ensures diversity in the SMUD/PG&E backbone and enhances the reliability of SMUD’s gas supply.

**Gas Storage**

SMUD also employs gas storage as part of its overall fuel supply strategy. Gas storage is useful in helping to balance gas supply, mitigate market price volatility, and provide a reliable supply to meet peak day delivery requirements.

SMUD has a contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2023 and expires in March 2026, for capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity.

SMUD also has a second contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2022 and expires in March 2024, for additional capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity. SMUD does not plan to renew this contract upon expiration.

SMUD has a contract with Wild Goose Storage LLC, that will begin in April 2024 (but which allows for early injection (December 2023 – March 2024)) for capacity in the Wild Goose Storage project located near Gridley in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 0.2 million Dth of storage inventory, ratcheted (12,500-14,000 Dth/day) volumes of injection rights and ratcheted (10,000 – 24,000 Dth/day) volumes of withdrawal capacity.

# Power Purchase Agreements

SMUD has a number of power purchase agreements to help meet its power requirements. Some of these agreements are described below.

## Western Area Power Administration
Effective January 1, 2005, SMUD entered into a 20-year contract with WAPA. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement extending the term by 30 years for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2054. Power sold under this contract is generated by the Central Valley Project (“CVP”), a series of federal hydroelectric facilities in northern California operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The contract provides WAPA’s CVP Base Resource customers (including SMUD) delivery of a percentage share of project generation in return for reimbursement of an equivalent share of project costs. SMUD’s CVP Base Resource share is roughly 25% of project generation and costs. This is expected to be approximately 318 MW of capacity and 661 GWh of energy in an average water year but will vary depending on precipitation. Energy available under the contract is determined by water releases required for water supply and flood control and is then shaped into higher value periods within other CVP operating constraints. More capacity and energy are typically available in spring and summer months and less in fall and winter.

SMUD also has a contract with WAPA expiring December 31, 2024, by which WAPA delivers an additional 200-300 MW per hour from projects located in the Pacific Northwest based on certain contractual parameters. In 2022, SMUD received 1,913 GWh of energy under this contract. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement for the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2030.

## Avangrid (formerly Iberdrola Renewables (“Iberdrola”))
SMUD has a contract with Iberdrola for 126 GWh of wind power generated in Solano County, California. The SMUD Board approved an extension of the wind contract through June 30, 2025.

## Patua Project LLC
In April 2010, SMUD entered into a power purchase agreement with Patua Project LLC (“Patua”), a subsidiary of Gradient Resources, for the delivery of up to 132 MW (expected to be 120 MW nominal power output) of renewable energy from geothermal generation being developed in north central Nevada, from a Gradient Resources project known as the Patua Project. The Patua Project was to have been developed in three phases. Since 2010, the agreed upon capacity has been reduced several times. In December 2013, Phase 1 of the project, which had been reduced to 30 MW, finally achieved commercial operation. In 2014, the parties concluded negotiations on the fourth amendment to the power purchase agreement with Patua, which reduced the total capacity down to 40 MW, extended the commercial operation date of Phase 2 to January 1, 2016, and allowed Patua to add up to 13 MW of solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production. In addition, this amendment shifted responsibility to Patua for a portion of the long-term transmission service agreements that have been underutilized due to the project not meeting its targets. In November 2015, the Patua Project was acquired by TL Power, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cyrq Energy, Inc. (“Cyrq”). In December 2015, Cyrq terminated Phase 2. Upon termination of Phase 2, the contractual right for Cyrq to add solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production was reduced to 10 MW. As a result of poor performance during the first year of operation, SMUD reduced its obligation to take power from 30 MW to 25 MW. Performance continued to lag in 2015 and 2016 and SMUD further reduced its obligation to take power from 25 MW to 19 MW.

## Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff
In September 2009, SMUD’s Board authorized a feed-in tariff program for the purchase of renewable energy from local renewable energy projects connected to SMUD’s distribution system. SMUD’s Board authorized connection of up to 100 MW under the feed-in tariff which included standard payment rates and standard purchase terms for power. The feed-in tariff program became effective on January 1, 2010. Under the feed-in tariff, SMUD has executed 20-year term power purchase

agreements for solar projects totaling 98.5 MW. Construction and start-up were completed on all projects between 2010 and 2012.

**CalEnergy LLC.** In August 2014, SMUD entered into a 22-year power purchase agreement with CalEnergy LLC for the purchase of 30 MW per year of renewable energy from its Salton Sea geothermal facilities. As of July 1, 2017, SMUD began receiving up to 10 MW from the CalEnergy portfolio, which escalated to the full 30 MWs on May 1, 2020.

**Rancho Seco Solar.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Rancho Seco Solar LLC for the purchase of energy from a 10.88 MW solar PV project sited on SMUD’s property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Commercial operation was achieved in August of 2016. Rancho Seco Solar LLC leased the property from SMUD under a land lease agreement. The output of this project directly serves two large commercial customers that executed agreements with SMUD for retail supply of solar power.

In May 2019, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement for an additional 160 MW solar PV project with Rancho Seco Solar II, LLC. The project is located on SMUD-owned property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, adjacent to the existing 10.88 MW solar PV project. Construction began in 2019, and the project became commercially operable in February 2021.

**Grady Wind Energy.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Grady Wind Energy LLC (“Grady”) for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW wind project located in New Mexico (the “Grady Project”). The Grady Project began commercial operations on August 5, 2019. Energy from the Grady Project is delivered to CAISO. SMUD purchases 100% of the Grady Project output, which includes energy, renewable energy credits, and capacity attributes.

**Great Valley Solar 2, LLC.** In January 2017, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Great Valley Solar 2, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 60 MW solar PV project located in Fresno County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was December 28, 2017.

**ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC.** On September 14, 2016, Senate Bill 859 (“SB 859”) was signed into law. Under SB 859, a POU must procure its proportionate share of 125 MW of renewable energy from biomass plants burning high hazard forest fuels, subject to terms of at least five years. Seven POUs (SMUD, MID, Turlock Irrigation District (“TID”), Anaheim Public Utilities, Imperial Irrigation District, Los Angeles Department of Water & Power and Riverside Public Utilities, collectively described herein as the “ARP-Loyalton POUs”) jointly solicited proposals for up to 29 MW of contract capacity for renewable energy to meet the requirements of SB 859. In January 2018, SMUD entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC to fulfill 18 MW of the required 29 MW with SMUD’s share being just over 23 percent (the “ARP-Loyalton PPA”). See “—Roseburg Forest Products Co.” below for a discussion of the remaining SB 859 capacity. The contract became effective on April 1, 2018. On February 18, 2020, ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and stopped producing and selling energy from the biomass plant. On May 7, 2022, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the Loyalton facility to Sierra Valley Enterprises, LLC (“SVE”). SVE initially expressed interest in bringing the facility back into service; however, the bankruptcy trustee requested requested extension of the deadline for SVE to accept or reject the ARP-Loyalton PPA. The latest deadline was April 19, 2023, the date of expiration of the ARP-Loyalton PPA terms. SVE did not resume operations before the end of the ARP-Loyalton PPA term, the ARP-Loyalton POUs have negotiated a settlement agreement with the bankruptcy trustee (the “ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement”). The ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement, which SMUD executed and is filed with the court, defines funds from the performance security that the ARP-Loyalton POUs will keep to cover legal and administrative fees, along with a contingency amount to cover potential risk of future damages. Since the ARP-Loyalton POUs entered into a five-year agreement to

A-37

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

procure compliant biomass and provided SVE the opportunity to accept the ARP-Loyalton PPA and restart operations, the ARP-Loyalton POUs consider their statutory obligations to have been fulfilled.

**Roseburg Forest Products Co.** For the remaining SB 859 biomass obligation of 11 MW, SMUD and the other ARP-Loyalton POUs have entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with Roseburg Forest Products Co. SMUD’s share of the contract capacity is 2.5795 MW, and the plant began operating under the contract on February 26, 2021.

**Sutter Energy Center.** SMUD entered into an initial two-year contract (with a third-year exercisable option) with Calpine Energy Services, L.P. (“Calpine”) for the ability to schedule up to 258 MW of energy from Sutter Energy Center. The Sutter Energy Center is a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle facility located in Yuba City, California. The initial contract became effective on April 1, 2018. SMUD exercised its option to extend the contract, which expired November 1, 2020. SMUD entered into a new contract with Calpine for the same 258 MW of energy that became effective January 1, 2021, and had an original expiration date of January 1, 2024. In December 2021, SMUD extended this contract through December 31, 2026.

**Drew Solar, LLC.** In June 2018, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Drew Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 100 MW solar PV project located in Imperial County, California. The project’s scheduled commercial operation date was set to be December 31, 2021. The commercial operation date was delayed due to Force Majeure claims surrounding the COVID pandemic and supply chain constraints caused by changes in Federal regulatory requirements. The project began commercially operating on November 3, 2022.

**Wildflower Solar I, LLC.** In October 2018, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Wildflower Solar I, LLC, for the purchase of energy, capacity, and RECs from a 13 MW solar PV project located in Rio Linda, California. The project began commercially operating on December 18, 2020.

**Coyote Creek (Formerly Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC.)** In August 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW solar PV and 100 MW four-hour Battery Energy Storage System (“BESS”) capacity project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but has been delayed to 2026 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

**SloughHouse Solar, LLC.** In September 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with SloughHouse Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 50 MW solar PV project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but the commercial operation date has been delayed to March 31, 2025 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

**Country Acres Solar.** In November 2023, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Country Acres Clean Power LLC for the purchase of energy from a 344 MW solar PV project, with a 20-year term for 172 MW four-hour BESS capacity, located in Placer County, California. The project’s commercial operation is expected to be December 15, 2026.

**Geysers Power Company, LLC.** In March 2021, SMUD executed a 10-year power purchase agreement with Geysers Power Company, LLC for 100 MW of energy and capacity from the Geysers geothermal energy plant located in Lake and Sonoma Counties, California. SMUD started to receive deliveries on January 1, 2023.

# Transmission Service Agreements

## TANC California-Oregon Transmission Project
The 340-mile COTP is one part of a three 500-kV line coordinated system known as the California-Oregon Intertie (“COI”). The COTP is allocated one-third of the 4,800 MW capability of the COI system (see related agreements below). TANC is entitled to 1,390 MW and is obligated to pay approximately 80% of the operating costs of the COTP. SMUD is a member of TANC and a party to Project Agreement No. 3 (“PA3”), under which it is entitled to 378 MW and obligated to pay on an unconditional take-or-pay basis about 27.5% of TANC’s COTP debt service and operations costs, subject to a “step-up” obligation of up to 25% of its entitlement share upon the unremedied default of another TANC member-participant. In 2009, SMUD entered into a long-term layoff agreement with certain members that increased SMUD’s entitlement by 35 MW. In 2014, SMUD entered into another long-term layoff agreement with certain other members that increased SMUD’s COTP entitlements by 128 MW and amended the 2009 layoff agreement that returned 13 MW to a member. In January 2024, SMUD entered into an agreement to extend the 2009 long-term layoff agreement with certain members to January 31, 2034. As of January 31, 2024, SMUD was entitled to approximately 528 MW of TANC’s transfer capability for imports and 405 MW for exports, and is obligated to pay approximately 38.6% of TANC’s COTP debt service and operations costs. SMUD’s payments under this contract, like SMUD’s payments under its other power purchase and transmission service agreements, are treated as “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under resolutions securing the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the section “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below). SMUD relies on its COTP rights to purchase power, access contingency reserves through the Western Power Pool, and obtain renewable resources to supplement its own resources to serve its load. TANC maintains a contingency reserve and provides insurance against budget for COTP costs, support services and advocacy expenses is about $45.4 million for 2023. SMUD’s obligation on the TANC budget is about $19 million for 2023.

## TANC Tesla-Midway Transmission Service
TANC has a long-term contract with PG&E to provide TANC with 300 MW of transmission service between PG&E’s Midway Substation and the electric systems of the TANC Members (the “Tesla-Midway Service”). SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service had been 46 MW. As part of the 2009 long-term layoff agreement, SMUD acquired an additional 2 MW of South-of-Tesla Principles (“SOTP”) transmission rights for 15 years starting February, 2009 from another TANC member, bringing SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service to 48 MW.

## Bonneville Power Administration
In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration (“BPA”) for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service from BPA’s Hilltop substation in northeastern California to the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua geothermal project over BPA’s 230kV transmission lines. In early 2013, in accordance with BPA’s transmission tariff, the transmission service was split into two 30 MW services and deferred as appropriate to better fit the timing of expected commercial operation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Patua Project LLC.” SMUD submitted another request for the 30 MW of transmission procured for Phase 2 of the Patua Project to split the service into a 10 MW and a 20 MW service, with the 10 MW service deferred and timed with the originally expected commercial operation date of Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 1 of the Patua Project and SMUD’s reduced obligation due to the poor performance of Phase 1 of the Patua Project, much of the transmission reserved for it will no longer be needed. BPA does not have a provision in its transmission tariff for early termination of transmission service. However, the power purchase agreement with Patua requires Patua to cover unused transmission that SMUD has procured for the Patua purchases. On January 1, 2020, SMUD’s transmission rights with BPA were reduced to 19 MW. This now aligns with SMUD’s Pacificorp transmission rights of 19 MW described in the immediately following paragraph.

A-39

**PacifiCorp.** In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with PacifiCorp for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service across PacifiCorp’s high voltage step-up transformer at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In early 2013, in accordance with PacifiCorp’s transmission tariff, the commencement of the 60 MW of transmission service was deferred to fit the timing of first deliveries expected from the 30 MW of Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In 2013, SMUD terminated the 60 MW of transmission service and requested two new transmission services of 30 MW each, with service start dates timed to better fit with the expected start dates of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the reduction in expected output of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the second 30 MW transmission agreement, and replaced it with a 10 MW transmission service agreement for Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 2 of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the 10 MW PacifiCorp transmission service agreement and as a result of the reduced obligation to take power from the Patua Project, SMUD has reduced its remaining PacifiCorp transmission service from 30 MW to 19 MW.

**Western Area Power Administration.** SMUD does not have a direct interconnection of its power system to the COTP. To receive power deliveries that use its COTP rights, SMUD has a long-term transmission service agreement with WAPA for transmission of 342 MW of power from the COTP line (received at WAPA’s Tracy or Olinda substations) to SMUD’s system. In May of 2011, WAPA completed the Sacramento Voltage Support Transmission Project. Completion of this project has given SMUD an additional 165 MW of transmission service rights on WAPA’s system from the COTP at the Olinda Substation to SMUD’s system at the Elverta Substation.

**Projected Resources**

The following tables titled “Projected Requirements and Resources to Meet Load Requirements Energy Requirements and Resources” (the “Energy Table”) and “Capacity Requirements and Resources Net Capacity – Megawatts” (the “Capacity Table”) describe SMUD’s contracted commitments and owned resources available to meet its forecasted load requirements through the year 2033. Resources are shown on an annualized basis with market purchases net against surplus sales to arrive at a single net position for each year. Because SMUD’s available resources do not exactly match its actual load requirements on an hourly basis, there are times during a year when resources available will either exceed or be insufficient to meet SMUD’s needs. Expected actual capacity values are included in the tables. These values may differ from measured net demonstrated capacity values of the Local Area Gas-Fired Plants. The table below also includes the impact energy efficiency has on resources requirements as discussed below under “Demand Side Management Programs.” See “BUSINESS STRATEGY” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.”

Resources listed in both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table are listed as either renewable or non-renewable. Generally, SMUD follows the CEC guidelines for eligibility requirements. Some of SMUD’s renewable resources listed include solar, wind, geothermal, small hydroelectric facilities with a capacity of 30 MW or less, and biomass (representing generation from a fuel comprised of agricultural wastes and residues, landscape and tree trimmings, wood and wood waste).

As in any forecast, assumptions are made. In both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table the WAPA and UARP forecasts assume average water conditions throughout the period. On the capacity table, WAPA and Cosumnes Power Plant renewable capacity is estimated based on the ratio of renewable energy to total WAPA or Cosumnes Power Plant energy. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric.”

A-40
<!-- Page 1234 -->
The Uncommitted Purchases (Sales) on the tables represent either anticipated future needs or surpluses. Future needs are met well in advance of delivery. They also include both renewable and non-renewable resources.

The Transmission Losses represent reductions in the amount of energy or capacity from the location it was purchased to the point of entering SMUD’s electrical system. This amount reduces the Total Resources available to meet the Total Projected Energy Requirements of the electrical system.

## Demand Side Management Programs

SMUD’s demand-side management initiatives represent an integral element of its total resource portfolio, and are organized into two major components: energy efficiency and load management programs. Energy efficiency offerings include a wide variety of programs and services to customers to retrofit or upgrade existing equipment and fixtures and to install new energy efficiency measures in existing and new construction facilities. Load management allows SMUD to reduce the load on the electric system by cycling residential air conditioning, and calling upon commercial/industrial customers to curtail energy usage when energy is constrained during the summer or system emergencies. Load management programs are projected to allow SMUD to shed approximately 60 MW of peak load in an emergency on a hot day, representing about 2% of SMUD’s maximum system peak demand.

The customer “smart meter” system with 2-way communication capability provides information regarding customer usage patterns, which is expected to help SMUD tailor rate designs that provide customers with both the information and ability to manage their energy usage around high energy cost periods.

# Balancing Authority Area Agreements

## Background
SMUD began operating as an independent control area, later termed a Balancing Authority, on June 18, 2002 within the WECC reliability organization’s region. This reduced SMUD’s exposure to the costs and reliability risks of the CAISO’s markets. SMUD expanded its operational footprint beyond SMUD’s service territory to include WAPA’s electric system, including the MID, Roseville, and Redding service areas (on January 1, 2005) and the COTP (on December 1, 2005). As described further below, SMUD ceased to be the Balancing Authority on April 30, 2011, as BANC took SMUD’s place as the Balancing Authority. SMUD remains the operator of the Balancing Authority through a contract with BANC. SMUD administers the contracts with WAPA and TANC to provide specified Balancing Authority-related and other services, and is compensated by WAPA and TANC. TANC recovers such Balancing Authority services costs as a part of its annual operating budget from the COTP Participants and WAPA recovers its Balancing Authority services costs through its rates for power and transmission service. The agreement with WAPA, among other terms, establishes operating procedures and reserve obligations between the parties and terminates on December 31, 2024. BANC, SMUD and WAPA will develop successor agreements in 2024 to take effect upon expiration of the existing contract. WAPA in turn has agreements with electric systems connected to it to assure that such systems also operate reliably (i.e., MID, Roseville and Redding). As a result of the transition to BANC as the Balancing Authority, SMUD assigned or terminated its interconnection and operations agreements with other connecting Balancing Authority areas (i.e., CAISO, BPA and TID). BANC is now the party to these agreements as they primarily address only Balancing Authority matters required for compliance with the reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”), such as emergency assistance arrangements. See also “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY” – Western Energy Imbalance Market.”

## Reliability Standards
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC authority to enforce reliability standards for the bulk electric system. In June 2007, these standards became mandatory for SMUD and BANC.

In 2022, SMUD and BANC underwent a combined NERC/WECC audit to evaluate compliance with applicable reliability standards. These audits occur every three years. At the conclusion of the audit, regulators determined that neither entity had any compliance violations related to the Operations and Planning or Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards. SMUD and BANC will undergo another NERC/WECC audit sometime in 2025.

## Balancing Authority of Northern California
SMUD, MID, Redding and Roseville executed a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (the “BANC JPA Agreement”) creating BANC on May 8, 2009. BANC became operational on May 1, 2011 as a Balancing Authority and replaced SMUD as the entity responsible for Balancing Authority-related reliability standards. Since that time, the Trinity Public Utilities District and the City of Shasta Lake have also become members of BANC. As provided in the BANC member agreement, liability for penalties associated with such Balancing Authority-related reliability standards are shared on a pro rata basis among the members of BANC. SMUD is the Balancing Authority operator under contract and performs Balancing Authority operational functions on behalf of BANC, much as it did when it was the Balancing Authority. The BANC JPA Agreement assigns cost responsibility based on member load within the BANC Balancing Authority, with SMUD representing approximately 70% of the total load.

## Power Pool and Other Agreements

### Western Power Pool Agreement
The Western Power Pool (“WPP”) is an agreement among over 30 utilities and public agencies in the western United States to coordinate contingency reserve sharing.
<!-- Page 1238 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

referred to as the WPP Reserve Sharing Program (“RSP”). The RSP permits participants to rely on one another in the event that any participant experiences a generating resource outage. While SMUD became an RSP participant in 2009, participation is limited to Balancing Authorities, which SMUD relinquished to BANC in 2011. Under the RSP, BANC and TID (also a WPP member) share their reserve amounts and when necessary and when sufficient unused COTP rights and capacity are available, may call upon WPP reserves from the RSP member systems in the Pacific Northwest. The WPP RSP permits members to operate more efficiently by reducing the contingency reserves that they would otherwise need to have available if they could not rely on each other.

**TANC-SMUD OASIS Administration Agreement.** SMUD entered into an agreement with TANC to provide OASIS services (transmission sales and scheduling related services in the BANC BA of TANC members’ COTP rights) on September 29, 2005. SMUD is compensated for performing these services. TANC and SMUD entered into a letter agreement dated October 25, 2010 to clarify each party’s role for regulatory reliability standards compliance responsibilities and take into account SMUD’s increased efforts related to supporting TANC’s compliance requirements. SMUD and TANC entered into an agreement to transition this service to the Western Area Power Administration, effective on May 1, 2023. Going forward SMUD will only have a minor role in receiving payments and distributing revenues to the TANC members.

**Other Interconnection Agreements**

**Background.** SMUD’s electric system was originally purchased from PG&E in 1947. SMUD’s service area is mostly surrounded by PG&E’s and WAPA’s service areas. The SMUD and PG&E electric systems are interconnected at SMUD’s Rancho Seco and Lake 230-kV substations. SMUD and WAPA are interconnected at SMUD’s Hurley, Elverta, Natomas and Folsom 230-kV substations.

**PG&E Interconnection Agreement.** PG&E and SMUD executed a Replacement Interconnection Agreement (“RIA”) which became effective on January 1, 2010. The RIA provides that SMUD and PG&E operate their interconnections reliably, plan their electric systems to meet their load requirements, and avoid or mitigate impacts they cause by certain electric system modifications. The agreement has a termination date of December 31, 2024, subject to FERC approval. SMUD and other Northern California utilities have similar interconnection agreements with PG&E, albeit with different expiration dates. PG&E filed a successor interconnection agreement with one of these utilities, TID, on November 1, 2023, to become effective on January 1, 2024. Many interconnection customers, including SMUD, intervened and submitted comments or protests in the FERC docket. FERC accepted the filing and TID and PG&E are now in a settlement process, pending litigation of the parties cannot resolve the disputed items. SMUD anticipates that PG&E will seek to negotiate a successor interconnection agreement with SMUD which will be informed by the TID settlement or litigation process. While some functional mechanisms in the interconnection agreement may change, SMUD expects that its successor interconnection agreement will substantially preserve the balance of burdens and benefits consistent with FERC’s standard of requiring rates and terms of service that are just and reasonable. SMUD expects this process to be completed by the current expiration date of the RIA.

**PG&E Generator Interconnection Agreements.** SMUD signed a LGIA with CAISO and PG&E for the Solano 3 Wind Project, effective December 16, 2008, with a 50-year term. The Solano 2 Wind Project has interconnection rights granted through a LGIA, also with the CAISO and PG&E. The agreement became effective in January 2010 and has a term of 20 years. On June 3, 2021, SMUD entered into a LGIA with the CAISO and PG&E, for the planned 90.8 MW Solano 4 Wind project with a 10-year term and automatic renewal for successive one-year terms thereafter. On February 27, 2023, SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process which combines the Solano 2, 3 & 4 projects into one Solano Wind Project. The original agreement conditions for the individual projects are carried forward with

A–45

a new combined project maximum production limit of 320.8 MW at the point of interconnection at the Russell Substation.

Other PG&E generator interconnection agreements include a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for Slab Creek with a 22-year term which became effective on January 14, 2010, and a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for the Chili Bar Project with a 10-year term which became effective on June 2, 2021.

WAPA Interconnection Agreement and other WAPA Agreements. SMUD and WAPA executed an interconnection agreement on May 8, 2008 for a term of 40 years which establishes the terms and conditions under which the SMUD and WAPA transmission systems are interconnected and memorializes related understandings. SMUD is working with WAPA on a reconfiguration at the shared Elverta interconnection to increase reliability and accommodate new generation interconnection in the area. SMUD has other agreements with WAPA including for operation of the Sutter Energy Center generating facility, communication systems terms and fiber optic access, training and for use of WAPA labor and heavy equipment to assist SMUD’s maintenance activities on an as-available basis.

# Management’s Discussion of SMUD’s Operating Results

## Year Ended December 31, 2023
For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $218.1 million as compared to an increase of $70.7 million for 2022.

Operating revenues were $228.5 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower sales of surplus gas ($118.3 million), transfers to the RSF ($67.2 million), sales to customers ($28.3 million), transfers from the RSF ($21.9 million), and LCFS revenue ($3.9 million), partially offset by higher sales of surplus power ($136.6 million), AB 32 revenue ($3.7 million), customer fees ($1.1 million), and lower transmission revenue ($2.3 million).

Operating expenses were $292.8 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower purchased power expenses ($175.5 million), production operating expenses ($146.4 million), depreciation expenses ($22.7 million), production maintenance expenses ($12.3 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($7.2 million), partially offset by higher administrative and general expenses ($33.4 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($15.8 million), public good expenses ($8.8 million), and customer service and information expenses ($6.6 million).

Non-Operating income increased by $55.2 million primarily due to fair market value assessment and gain on sale of land ($33.3 million), higher interest income ($21.7 million), higher unrealized holding gains ($11.4 million), higher CCA revenue ($5.7 million), partially offset by lower investment income ($39.1 million).

Interest expense decreased $27.9 million from 2022.

## Year Ended December 31, 2022
For the year ended December 31, 2022, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $70.7 million as compared to an increase of $347.3 million for 2021.

Operating revenues were $363.0 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher sales to customers ($130.7 million), sales of surplus gas ($96.0 million), sales of surplus power ($62.2 million), transfers to the RSF ($28.9 million), transfers from the RSF ($24.3 million), customer fees ($9.5 million), AB 32 revenue ($4.9 million) and LCFS revenue ($2.2 million), partially offset by lower gain on sale of carbon allowance futures ($3.7 million).

Operating expenses were $601.2 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher purchased power expenses ($263.6 million), amortization of pension and OPEB ($126.9 million), production operating expenses ($125.1 million), depreciation expenses ($49.5 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($22.1 million), production maintenance expenses ($18.4 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($8.1 million), public good expenses ($7.4 million), and customer service and information expenses ($4.5 million), partially offset by lower administrative and general expenses ($27.4 million).

Non-Operating income decreased by $19.0 million primarily due to lower grant revenue ($39.6 million), unrealized holding losses ($3.7 million), partially offset by higher investment income ($19.7 million), closeout of escrow account ($2.8 million), and loss on asset retirements ($1.9 million).

Interest expense increased $19.5 million from 2021.

## Regulatory Assets
In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” SMUD defers, as regulatory assets, certain types of expenditures. These assets are amortized and collected through future rates. 

A-50
<!-- Page 1244 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had a total of $916.1 million recorded for regulatory assets. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 68 which requires SMUD to record a net pension liability was $323.5 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 68 was $174.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 75 which requires SMUD to record a net Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) liability was $268.2 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 75 was $39.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with Rancho Seco decommissioning costs totaled $108.0 million at December 31, 2023. Nuclear fuel storage costs and non-radiological decommissioning costs have been collected in rates since 2009. For a complete description of these regulatory assets, see Note 8 (Regulatory Deferrals) to SMUD’s financial statements.

The Board has authorized the deferral of any charges or credits that result from the change in valuation of ineffective hedges that should be reported as Investment Revenue/Expense on the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and changes in net position. The Board’s resolution establishes that such charges or credits are not included in rates based on market value changes but are included in rates when the underlying transactions occur. Therefore, under GASB No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” any such changes are included in the Statement of Net Position as regulatory assets or liabilities. For a complete description of these derivative financial instruments, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s financial statements.

**RANCHO SECO DECOMMISSIONING**

**Overview.** The 913 MW Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant (“Rancho Seco”) began operation in 1970 and was licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”). In June 1989, the Board voted against allowing SMUD to continue to operate Rancho Seco as a nuclear generating facility, and the plant was shut down. In 1991, SMUD submitted a report (the “Financial Assurance Plan”) providing financial assurance to the NRC that SMUD will have sufficient funds available to pay for the cost of decommissioning. On March 17, 1992, the NRC granted SMUD a change from operating to a possession-only license for Rancho Seco that relieved SMUD from compliance with a number of NRC regulations applicable to operating nuclear power plants. SMUD also filed a proposed decommissioning plan with the NRC (the “Decommissioning Plan”), which was approved in March 1995.

After the decommissioning efforts began, no suitable disposal option was available to SMUD for the Class B and Class C low level radioactive waste generated during the plant decommissioning. With the used nuclear fuel stored onsite requiring oversight staff, SMUD opted to store the Class B and Class C radioactive waste in an existing interim onsite storage building until a suitable disposal option was available. In November 2007, the possession-only license for Rancho Seco was amended to update the Decommissioning Plan to terminate the possession-only license for the Class B and Class C waste in two phases. Phase I of the decommissioning was completed at the end of 2008. Following verification of the site conditions, SMUD submitted a request to the NRC to reduce the licensed facility from 2,480 acres to the interim onsite storage building and about one acre surrounding it. The request was approved by the NRC in September 2009. Phase II of decommissioning included the approximately two-acre interim storage building containing the Class B and Class C radioactive waste and surrounding area. In September 2013, SMUD entered into a contract with the operator of the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility located in Andrews, Texas. Shipment of the Class B and Class C radioactive waste for disposal was completed in November 2014. SMUD conducted additional clean-up activities and radiological surveys, which were followed by NRC confirmatory surveys. The results of these surveys demonstrated unit dose criteria well below NRC release criteria, and the NRC approved the Phase II area for unrestricted use. On September 21, 2017, SMUD formally requested the termination of the possession-only license. On August A-51
<!-- Page 1245 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

31, 2018, the NRC officially terminated SMUD’s possession-only license for the remaining Class B and Class C waste at Rancho Seco.

As part of the Decommissioning Plan, the nuclear fuel and Greater Than Class C (“GTCC”) radioactive waste is being stored in a dry storage facility (the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation or “ISFSI”) constructed by SMUD, adjacent to the former reactor facility. The NRC has separately licensed this facility. The DOE, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, is responsible for permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel and GTCC radioactive waste. SMUD has a contract with the DOE for the removal and disposal of this waste. The DOE was to have a waste repository operating by 1998, but has experienced significant and ongoing delays. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act designates Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the final and exclusive repository for the nation’s used nuclear fuel. The DOE discontinued the Yucca Mountain license review activities in 2010, but after a court ordered the NRC to resume its review in 2013, the NRC published its final safety evaluation report in 2015. The final safety report, and the final environmental impact statement, concluded that the proposed repository would be safe and environmentally sound for one million years.

Nevertheless, seeking alternatives to Yucca Mountain, the Blue-Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future delivered its final report in January 2012 with several recommendations. The DOE responded to the recommendations by issuing a report in January 2013 (Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste). Key to both documents is a focus on used fuel from decommissioned sites including Rancho Seco. The DOE report accepts most of the Blue-Ribbon Commission recommendations, and contains timelines for fuel management options which proposed removing the fuel from Rancho Seco as early as 2021. However, any progress on the strategies proposed by the DOE is dependent on legislative action by Congress. With no legislative action taken to this time when the DOE will fulfill its contractual obligations to remove the nuclear fuel and GTCC waste from the Rancho Seco facility. In the meantime, SMUD continues to incur costs of approximately $5 to $7 million per year for storage of used nuclear fuel at the ISFSI. SMUD has filed a series of successful lawsuits against the federal government for recovery of past spent fuel costs. SMUD last recovered over $14 million in 2023. SMUD plans to continue pursuing cost recovery claims to ensure it is reimbursed for all such costs in the future. The ISFSI will be decommissioned, and its license terminated after the fuel and GTCC is removed.

Financial Assurance Plan. In accordance with the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD established and funded an external decommissioning trust fund currently held by Computershare Corporate Trust (the “Decommissioning Trust Fund”). Pursuant to the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD made the final deposit into the Decommissioning Trust Fund in 2008. Additional deposits are not expected but will be made if increased cost estimates or reduced fund interest earnings require it. In 2011, the NRC began requiring that SMUD demonstrate financial assurance for decommissioning the ISFSI as well as the former power facility, increasing the overall cost for decommissioning Rancho Seco. The estimated total cost for decommissioning the ISFSI was approximately $7.1 million on December 31, 2023. The decommissioning cost estimate is required to be updated every three years. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the Decommissioning Trust Fund was $9.4 million, excluding unrealized gains and losses. Based on the current decommissioning cost estimate and the value of the fund, SMUD’s existing Decommissioning Trust Fund provides sufficient funds to complete decommissioning and terminate the ISFSI license.

In addition to these costs, SMUD also estimates that it would cost approximately $13.1 million to restore the site to make it available for other SMUD uses with some major structures remaining intact. Site restoration is not a legal requirement. No site restoration is currently underway.

# EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

SMUD has approximately 2,334 employees, most of whom are covered by a civil service system. SMUD is a contracting member of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“PERS”). Approximately 50% of SMUD’s workforce is represented as to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment, by one of three recognized employee organizations, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) Local 1245, the Organization of SMUD Employees (“OSE”), and the SMUD Public Safety Officers’ Association (“PSOA”). The remaining 50% of SMUD’s workforce, which includes managers, professional, administrative, supervisory, confidential and security staff, is unrepresented.

SMUD negotiated a four-year Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with IBEW and the OSE, effective January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2025. Both contracts contain a no-strike/no-lockout clause effective during the life of the agreements. SMUD has an MOU with PSOA effective through December 31, 2026. SMUD has experienced only one labor interruption, which occurred in January 1980 that lasted four days.

# RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POST-EMPLOYMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

## Pension Plans

SMUD participates in PERS, an agent multiple-employer public employee defined benefit plan. PERS provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. PERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State. Benefit provisions are established by State statute and SMUD policies. The pension plan provides retirement benefits, survivor benefits, and death and disability benefits based upon employees’ years of credited service, age, and final compensation.

As of June 30, 2022, the last actuarial valuation date for SMUD’s plan within PERS, the market value of the SMUD plan assets was $2.32 billion. The plan is 87.8% funded on a market value of assets basis, a decrease of 12.3% compared to the June 30, 2021 funded status based on the market value of assets.

As an employer, SMUD is required to contribute a percentage of payroll each year to PERS to fund SMUD’s plan based on actuarial valuations performed by PERS. PERS collects the normal cost based on a percentage of payroll and the unfunded liability portion is based on a dollar amount. SMUD also makes partial contributions required of SMUD employees on their behalf and for their account. At the PERS fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, SMUD’s required employer contribution rate for normal cost was 9.8% of payroll and the unfunded liability contribution was $22.4 million. During 2023, SMUD contributed $37.4 million to PERS (including SMUD’s contributions to cover required employee contributions), and SMUD employees paid $18.3 million for their share of the PERS contribution.

For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025, SMUD is required to contribute 9.6% and 9.5% of payroll for normal costs and $10.7 million for fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 for the unfunded liability contribution. There is no estimated employer contribution to the unfunded liability for fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Assuming no amendments to the plan and no liability gains or losses (which can have a significant impact), PERS has projected that SMUD will be required to contribute 9.4% of payroll to the plan for normal costs and $15.7 million for the unfunded liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions. The amount SMUD is required to contribute to PERS is expected to increase in the future. The actual amount of such increases
<!-- Page 1247 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

SMUD has the option to prepare an annual lump sum payment to PERS for the unfunded accrued liability portion only (not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions). SMUD made an annual lump sum prepayment of $19.5 million, and also voluntarily made an additional payment of $47.3 million, for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. SMUD was not required to make an annual lump sum prepayment and, to date, has not voluntarily made additional payments for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

While SMUD has some ability to adjust the retirement benefits provided to its employees, PERS determines the actuarial methods and assumptions used with respect to assets administered by PERS (including the SMUD plan assets) and makes the investment decisions with respect to such assets. For a description of such actuarial methods and assumptions (including the smoothing conventions used by PERS when setting employer contribution rates) and investments, see the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS (SMUD’s plan is part of the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund of PERS) available on its website at www.calpers.ca.gov. SMUD cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information and neither the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS nor any other information contained on the PERS website is incorporated by reference in or part of this Official Statement. Actuarial assessments are “forward-looking” information that reflect the judgment of the fiduciaries of the pension plans, and are based upon a variety of assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be inaccurate or be changed in the future. Actuarial assessments will change with the future experience of the pension plans.

GASB issued Statement No. 68 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – An Amendment of GASB Statement No. 27” (“GASB No. 68”). The primary objective of GASB No. 68 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for pensions. Under GASB No. 68, SMUD is required to report the net pension asset or net pension liability (i.e., the difference between the total pension liability and the pension plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of investment gains and losses. GASB No. 68 separates financial reporting from funding requirements for pension plans. The pension liabilities as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is $259.0 million and $235.5 million, respectively.

SMUD provides its employees with two cash deferred compensation plans: one pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 401(k) (the “401(k) Plan”) and one pursuant to IRC Section 457 (the “457 Plan” and collectively, the “Plans”). The Plans are contributory plans in which SMUD’s employees contribute the funds. Each of SMUD’s eligible full-time or permanent part-time employees may participate in either or both Plans, and amounts contributed by employees are vested immediately. Such funds are held by a trustee in trust for the employees upon retirement from SMUD service and, accordingly, are not subject to the general claims of SMUD’s creditors. SMUD makes annual contributions to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of certain employees pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with both of its collective bargaining units. SMUD matches the non-represented employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to a set amount. SMUD also makes limited discretionary contributions to non-represented employees hired after January 1, 2013, which contributions fully vest after five years. Prior to 2022, SMUD did not match employee contributions, nor make contributions on behalf of its employees to the 457 Plan. Beginning in 2022, SMUD makes annual contributions to the 457 Plan on behalf of certain employees and matches employee contributions up to a set amount pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with one of its collective bargaining units. SMUD made contributions to both Plans of $6.9 million in 2023 and to the 401(k) Plan of $7.0 million in 2022. Participating employees made contributions into both Plans totaling $34.3 million in 2023 and $32.4 million in 2022.

![Other Post-Employment Benefits](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Other+Post-Employment+Benefits)

**Other Post-Employment Benefits**

SMUD provides post-employment healthcare benefits, in accordance with SMUD policy and negotiated agreements with employee representation groups in a single employer defined benefit plan, to all employees who retire from SMUD, and their dependents. SMUD also provides post-employment healthcare benefits to covered employees who are eligible for disability retirement. SMUD contributes the full cost of coverage for retirees hired before January 1, 1991, and a portion of the cost based on credited years of service for retirees hired after January 1, 1991. SMUD also contributes a portion of the costs of coverage for these retirees’ dependents. Retirees are required to contribute the portion that is not paid by SMUD. The benefits, benefit levels, retiree contributions and employer contributions are governed by SMUD and can be amended by SMUD through its personnel manual and union contracts.

SMUD’s post-employment health care benefits are funded through the PERS California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (“CERBT”), an agent multiple-employer plan. The funding of a plan occurs when the following events take place: the employer makes payments of benefits directly to or on behalf of a retiree or beneficiary; the employer makes premium payments to an insurer; or the employer irrevocably transfers assets to a trust or other third party acting in the role of trustee, where the plan assets are dedicated to the sole purpose of the payments of the plan benefits, and creditors of the government do not have access to those assets.

SMUD has elected to contribute the normal costs to the CERBT but annually receive reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT. In 2024, SMUD’s contribution for the normal costs to CERBT is $10.6 million. In 2023, SMUD made a contribution to the CERBT for normal costs in the amount of $8.6 million. In 2022, SMUD decided to forgo making a contribution for the normal costs to the CERBT because there was a net OPEB asset as of December 31, 2021. SMUD made additional contributions to the trust. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD made healthcare benefit contributions by paying actual medical costs of $24.7 million and $24.5 million, respectively. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD received $24.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively, reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT.

At June 30, 2023 and 2022, SMUD estimated that the actuarially determined accumulated post-employment benefit obligation was approximately $403.6 and $381.7 million, respectively. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the plan was 92.3% and 97.9% funded, respectively.

SMUD’s actuary uses PERS economic and other assumptions as the basis for the calculation of the post-employment benefit obligation. The actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will vary substantially if such PERS assumptions, such as interest rate and life expectancy, among others, prove to be inaccurate or different than SMUD’s actual experience. Although SMUD believes that such assumptions and estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that any such assumptions will prove to be accurate, or that SMUD’s actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will not materially exceed its estimates. Additional information is available in Note 15 (Other Postemployment Benefits) and “Required Supplementary Information” to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

GASB previously issued SGAS No. 75 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions”. The primary objective of GASB No. 75 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for post-employment benefits other than pensions (“OPEB”). Under GASB No. 75, SMUD is required to report the net OPEB asset or net OPEB liability (i.e., the difference between the total OPEB liability and the OPEB plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of

![Estimated Capital Requirements](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Estimated+Capital+Requirements)

**CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS**

**Estimated Capital Requirements**

SMUD has a projected capital requirement of approximately $2.8 billion for the period 2024 through 2028 as shown in the table below. Approximately 60% of this requirement is anticipated to be funded with internally generated funds and cash on hand.

Special projects include costs relating to construction of large substations and the construction of Solano Phase 4. The Estimated Capital Requirements table below includes $51 million for Solano Phase 4. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Solano 4 Project.”

**Outstanding Indebtedness**

**General.** SMUD typically finances its capital requirements through the sale of revenue bonds, the sale of commercial paper, from draws on its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and from internally generated funds. With the enactment of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2024 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, SMUD is monitoring and exploring new methods of financing, including those afforded under these two federal laws, that provide not-for-profit public power utilities with direct federal incentive payments.

SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Senior Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 (the “Senior Resolution”) adopted in 1971, as amended and supplemented (the “Senior Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Senior Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $1,783,965,000 outstanding. The Senior Bonds are payable solely from the Net Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Senior Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of “Maintenance and Operation Costs” and “Energy Payments” as defined in the Senior Resolution, including payments by SMUD to TANC under PA3, payments by SMUD under power purchase agreements related to the Authorities and payments by SMUD to NCGA and NCEA under their respective gas supply contracts. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD’s Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the “Subordinated Resolution”).
<!-- Page 1250 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

“Subordinate Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Subordinated Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds.

SMUD issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of March 21, 2024, SMUD’s Notes were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes (and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit) are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD also entered into a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank and issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes thereunder (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in February 2022. As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future. SMUD’s obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

Joint Powers Authorities. SMUD has entered into long-term take-or-pay purchase agreements with SFA relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Under such agreements, SMUD has exclusive control of the dispatch of all five of the Local Gas-Fired Plants and takes all of the power produced by the Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” The Authorities are each treated as component units of SMUD for accounting purposes. Only SFA has outstanding debt, which relates solely to the Cosumnes Power Plant and is payable solely from capacity payments made by SMUD under the related power purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2023, bonds issued by SFA to finance the Cosumnes Power Plant were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $87,890,000. SMUD’s payments under the power purchase agreements relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal of and interest on the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and Subordinate Resolution.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCGA as a joint powers authority. NCGA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCGA issued $757,055,000 in bonds in May 2007 for the purpose of paying Morgan Stanley Capital Group in advance for natural gas to be delivered to NCGA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas supplies delivered by NCGA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the
<!-- Page 1251 -->
![NCGA bonds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=NCGA+bonds)

NCGA bonds. As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $120,070,000 remain outstanding.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCEA as a joint powers authority. NCEA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCEA issued $539,615,000 in bonds in December 2018 for the purpose of paying J. Aron & Company LLC in advance for natural gas or electricity to be delivered to NCEA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas or electricity supplies delivered by NCEA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the NCEA bonds. [As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $537,295,000 remain outstanding. As described in the forepart of this Official Statement, the bonds issued by NCEA in 2018 are expected to be refunded with proceeds of the Bonds (as defined in the forepart of this Official Statement.)] [to be revised for 2024 Senior Bond offering documents]

**Interest Rate Swap Agreements.** SMUD has two interest rate swap agreements relating to previously or currently outstanding Subordinated Bonds, as shown in the following table. For more information, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

| Effective Date | Termination Date | SMUD Pays | SMUD Receives | Notional Amount (000's) | Counterparty |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 7/2/1997       | 7/1/2024         | Floating  | SIFMA          | 5.154%                  | $19,570      | J Aron & Company LLC |
| 07/12/2023     | 08/15/2041       | Fixed     | 0.718%         | [70% of 1M SOFR]       | 132,020      | Barclays Bank |

The obligations of SMUD under the swap agreements are not secured by a pledge of revenues of SMUD’s electric system or any other property of SMUD. SMUD does not currently have any collateral posting requirements with respect to the interest rate swap agreements, but SMUD may be required to post collateral under certain circumstances.

**Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments.** SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”) and Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series W (the “2010 Series W Bonds”) were issued as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. At the time the 2009 Series V Bonds and 2010 Series W Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive an annual cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. However, as a result of the federal budget process, many payments from the federal government, including Build America Bonds subsidy payments, have been reduced. Absent the federal budget reductions, the aggregate annual cash subsidy payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds would be approximately $9.8 million. With the current federal budget reductions, SMUD has typically been receiving aggregate annual cash subsidy payments with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds of approximately $9.2 million. It is possible that future federal budget actions could further reduce, or eliminate entirely, the annual cash subsidy payments with respect to Build America Bonds, including the annual cash subsidy payments payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. SMUD cannot predict the likelihood of the further reduction or elimination of the Build America Bonds subsidy payments. A significant reduction or elimination of the cash subsidy

# INSURANCE

SMUD maintains a comprehensive property/casualty insurance program designed to protect against catastrophic losses that would have an adverse effect on its financial position or operational capabilities. Insurance programs are continuously reviewed and modified when construction, operational exposures, or developments in the insurance industry so warrant. Long-term relationships with a variety of insurers minimize SMUD’s susceptibility to the effects of market cycles. SMUD budgets reserves to meet potential insurance deductibles and self-insured liability claims.

SMUD safeguards assets with all-risk property and boiler/machinery insurance with limits of $800 million per occurrence for physical damage and business interruption combined. Various coverage sublimits and deductibles apply to losses arising from certain perils, such as business interruption, earthquake, or flood, respectively. Liability insurance is in effect to defend and indemnify SMUD against third party claims, including general, automobile and sudden and accidental pollution claims with policy limits of $140 million, and wildfire coverage with policy limits of $275 million, all of which include a variety of self-insured retentions.

Nuclear property and liability insurance policies are maintained in accordance with the NRC’s requirements for decommissioned nuclear plants that maintain dry storage of spent fuel on-site. This includes $100 million in first party property damage and decontamination, $100 million for nuclear liability arising from accidents on-site, $200 million for supplier’s and transporter’s nuclear liability, and $300 million for nuclear worker liability. SMUD is exposed to possible retrospective assessments for nuclear property events occurring at other nuclear facilities in the United States capped at ten times SMUD’s annual nuclear property premium (currently the maximum retrospective assessment is approximately $1,000,000).

Other types of insurance include non-owned aircraft liability, workers’ compensation, crime, cyber security, fidelity, fiduciary liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, professional errors and omissions, transportation, and builder’s risk for major facilities under construction.

# LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

SMUD is a party to numerous actions arising out of the conduct of its business and affairs, some of which are discussed below. SMUD believes that any losses or adverse financial results it may suffer in these current actions, to the extent not covered by insurance, would not, in the aggregate, have an adverse material impact on SMUD, its business and affairs, or results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

## Environmental Litigation

SMUD was one of many potentially responsible parties that had been named in a number of actions relating to environmental claims and/or complaints. SMUD has resolved these environmental claims and/or complaints and entered into settlement agreements and/or consent orders. These settlement agreements and consent orders have statutory reopener provisions which allow regulatory agencies to seek additional funds for environmental remediation under certain limited circumstances. While SMUD believes it is unlikely that any of the prior settlements or consent orders will be reopened, the possibility exists. If any of the settlements or consent orders were to be reopened, SMUD believes that the outcome will not have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

## Proposition 26 Lawsuit

In October 2019, two SMUD customers jointly filed a complaint against SMUD (subsequently one of the customers removed themselves from the complaint), which stated that SMUD’s Board violated

A-60
<!-- Page 1254 -->
![Proposition 26](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Proposition+26)

**Proposition 26** (see “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Proposition 26” for a description of Proposition 26) when on June 24, 2019, it adopted rate increases for 2020 and 2021. The plaintiff contended the rates did not reflect SMUD’s reasonable cost of service because they included a 9.2% scalar that SMUD applies to its TOD residential rate restructure adopted by SMUD’s Board in the 2017 rate process. SMUD viewed the lawsuit as having little merit and while SMUD anticipated the court would rule in SMUD’s favor on substantive grounds, the plaintiff in early 2024 agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice due to their failure to diligently prosecute the case. On January 16, 2024, the court approved the dismissal.

On January 19, 2024, the same plaintiff, along with a second SMUD residential customer, jointly filed a new complaint challenging the September 21, 2023, SMUD Board adoption of 2024 and 2025 rate increases. The plaintiffs make a similar claim regarding the TOD scalar as the prior lawsuit. Given the little merit behind the lawsuit, SMUD believes the court will rule in its favor. However, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the case or, if to the extent SMUD ultimately is not successful in the litigation, what remedies against SMUD may be available. SMUD believes that if it is not successful in the litigation, and to the extent the outcome would have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, the Board would make appropriate rate modifications based on an evidentiary record consistent with guidance from a judicial decision in the case.

**Other Litigation Matters**

Currently, SMUD is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints relating to its operations, including, but not limited to, property damage, personal injury, contract disputes, and employment matters. SMUD believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

**FERC Administrative Proceedings**

SMUD is involved in a number of FERC administrative proceedings related to the operation of wholesale energy markets, regional transmission planning, gas transportation and NERC reliability standards. These proceedings generally fall into the following categories: (i) filings initiated by the CAISO (or other market participants) to adopt/modify the CAISO Tariff and/or establish market design and behavior rules; (ii) filings initiated by existing transmission owners (i.e., PG&E and the other IOUs) to pass-through costs to their existing wholesale transmission customers; (iii) filings initiated by FERC to market participants to establish market design and behavior rules or investigate market behavior by certain market participants; (iv) filings initiated by transmission owners under their transmission owner tariffs to establish a regional transmission planning process; (v) filings initiated by providers of firm gas transportation services under the Natural Gas Act; and (vi) filings initiated by NERC to develop reliability standards applicable to owners, users, and operators of the bulk electric system. In addition, SMUD is an active participant in other FERC administrative proceedings, including those related to reliability, variable resource integration and the changing resource mix, and transmission planning and cost allocation. SMUD believes that determinations of these FERC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

**CPUC Administrative Proceedings**

Periodically, PG&E seeks to update its gas transmission and storage (“GT&S”) revenue requirements and rate designs. These applications are litigated at the CPUC and affect SMUD through several tariff rates SMUD pays to move natural gas along PG&E’s backbone transmission lines. In the 2019 GT&S rate case (the “2019 GT&S Case”), the CPUC affirmed the application in GT&S rates of cost causation principles to prevent excessive and unreasonable costs being shifted to electric generator. 

A-61

backbone customers like SMUD, either through proposed changes in PG&E’s natural gas storage strategy or through cost shifts within the electric generator customer class.

PG&E filed its 2023 General Rate Case (the “GRC”) in June 2021 which includes its gas transmission and storage revenue requirements. In September 2021, PG&E filed an application for approval of its Gas Cost Allocation and Rate Design Proposals (“CARD”). The CPUC issued a decision in the GRC in November 2023 authorizing PG&E’s revenue requirements for the four-year rate period of 2023-2026. SMUD is a party to the comprehensive all-party settlement agreement submitted to the CPUC for approval in June 2023 which, if approved, would resolve all open issues in the CARD proceeding. SMUD does not believe that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. SMUD will continue to actively participate in PG&E’s GRC and CARD proceedings to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to non-core customers, including electric generator backbone customers.

In the GRC, the CPUC directed PG&E to submit an application to revise its natural gas curtailment procedures “similar to the curtailment procedures of other large energy utilities”. SMUD will actively participate in this future proceeding.

Separately, SMUD continues to participate and monitor a proceeding at the CPUC concerning long-term gas system planning. At this point in these proceedings, SMUD does not anticipate that the resolution of such cases will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

SMUD monitors a number of other CPUC proceedings. These proceedings generally fall into three categories: (i) filings initiated by PG&E to adopt/modify its tariffs and/or rules; (ii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish market design and behavior rules or program rules affecting SMUD customers; and (iii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish electric and/or gas system safety design and maintenance rules. SMUD believes that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

# DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR

## California Electric Market

In 1996, the State partially deregulated its electric energy market and the CAISO was established in 1998. Since the CAISO’s formation, the State has experienced episodes of higher and more volatile prices for natural gas and wholesale electricity. In reaction to such conditions, SMUD made significant changes to its business strategy to mitigate the impacts of the more volatile and unpredictable energy markets. Volatility in energy prices in the State are always a potential risk due to a variety of factors which affect both the supply and demand for electricity in the western United States. These factors include, but are not limited to, the implementation of the CAISO market design changes, insufficient generation resources, the increase in intermittent renewable energy resources, natural gas price volatility, fuel costs and availability, weather and natural disasters, transmission constraints and levels of hydroelectric generation within the region. While SMUD has taken a number of steps to mitigate its exposure to price volatility associated with these factors, this price volatility under extreme conditions may contribute to greater volatility in SMUD’s net revenues from the purchase and sale of electric energy and, therefore, could materially adversely affect the financial condition and liquidity of SMUD. For a discussion of SMUD’s current resource planning activities and risk management strategies, see “BUSINESS STRATEGY” above.

# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity continues to be a top priority for SMUD. Attacks or threats directed at critical electric or energy sector operations could damage or cause the shut-down of generation, transmission or distribution assets that are essential to SMUD’s ability to serve its customers, cause operational malfunctions and outages affecting SMUD’s electric system, and result in costly recovery and remediation efforts. The costs of security measures or of remedying breaches could be material.

SMUD participates in sharing and receiving information about cyber security threats in real-time through the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (“E-ISAC”), the central hub for such data to actively manage risk related to potential cyber intrusion. SMUD also participates in NERC’s development of mandatory, enforceable cyber security standards to address vulnerabilities in electric utility NIST and through active engagement in the cyber security policy dialogue in Congress.

SMUD’s prudent response to this ever-changing threat requires constant monitoring and frequent updates to implement new regulatory requirements as they are developed. SMUD manages risk related to frequently changing regulatory requirements by participating in the development of standards at NERC and NIST.

# Physical Security

Physical security is a critical concern for electric utilities as they seek to protect their infrastructure from a range of threats. The electric utility infrastructure is complex and consists of multiple components, such as power plants, substations, transmission and distribution lines, and other facilities. SMUD employs a dedicated physical security team that is deployed 24/7 and allows SMUD to respond to emergent events in a safe, coordinated, efficient, and cohesive manner, protecting the lives of its employees, customers, community, properties and assets. SMUD has policies, processes and procedures in place that outline the access controls and restrictions for its properties. SMUD restricts access based on need as it determines, while adhering to applicable laws, regulations and standards such as NERC Reliability Standards and NRC regulations. SMUD also maintains a Utility Security Plan adopted by the Board representing SMUD’s compliance with the CPUC’s Safety and Enforcement Division six-step security plan process described in CPUC Decision 19-01-018.

During times of elevated, imminent threats, safety and/or security concerns, SMUD’s Security Operations team, under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer or delegate, reserves the right to deploy additional security measures, controls, and further restrict or limit access to its properties to increase its security posture.

SMUD operates a 24/7 security operations center which monitors and coordinates responses to situations reported by internal and external stakeholders, or which are detected by SMUD’s security technology. The technology includes access control, video surveillance, and various types of intrusion detection solutions. The security operations center is a central hub for initial contact for physical security calls from employees of suspicious events and initiates incident responses as needed.

# Federal Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings

## Energy Policy Act of 2005

On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct of 2005”) was signed into law. The law includes a number of energy-related provisions, including among other things limited FERC jurisdiction over interstate transmission assets of municipal utilities, cooperatives and federal utilities to order these entities to provide transmission services on rates and terms. 

A-63
<!-- Page 1257 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Federal Regulation of Transmission Access.** The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the “Energy Policy Act”) made fundamental changes in the federal regulation of the electric utility industry, particularly in the area of transmission access. The Energy Policy Act provided FERC with the authority to require a transmitting utility to provide transmission services at rates, charges, terms and conditions set by FERC. The purpose of these changes, in part, was to bring about increased competition in the electric utility industry. Under the Energy Policy Act, electric utilities owned by municipalities and other public agencies which own or operate electric power transmission facilities which are used for the sale of electric energy at wholesale are “transmitting utilities” subject to the requirements of the Energy Policy Act.

Since the Energy Policy Act, FERC has adopted a series of rules to implement competitive open access to transmission facilities and regional transmission planning. Order No. 888, issued in 1996, requires the provision of open access transmission services on a nondiscriminatory basis by all “jurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does not include municipal entities like SMUD) by requiring all such utilities to file OATTs. Order No. 888 also requires “nonjurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does include SMUD) that purchase transmission services from a jurisdictional utility under an open access tariff and that owns or controls transmission facilities to provide open access service to the jurisdictional utility under terms that are comparable to the service that the nonjurisdictional utility provides itself. Section 211 of the EPAct of 2005 authorizes, but does not require, FERC to direct transmission utilities to provide transmission services, including rates and terms and conditions, that are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting utility provides transmission services to itself that are not unduly discriminatory or preferential – often referred to as the reciprocity rule.

In Order 890, issued in 2007, FERC stated that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis and retain the current reciprocity provisions.

In 2011, FERC issued Order 1000, which among other things requires public utility (jurisdictional) transmission providers to participate in a regional transmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan and that incorporates a regional and inter-regional cost allocation methodology. Similar to Order 890, FERC states that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis. However, in Order 1000, FERC appears to expand upon the current reciprocity provisions and states that it has the authority to allocate costs to beneficiaries of services provided by specific transmission facilities even in the absence of a contractual relationship between the owner of the transmission facilities and the identified beneficiary.

SMUD, individually, and through the Large Public Power Council (“LPPC”), appealed Order 1000, but in 2014 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the arguments raised on appeal, upholding the entirety of Order 1000.

The jurisdictional members of WestConnect filed their proposed regional planning process and cost allocation methodology through a series of compliance filings at FERC. FERC accepted binding cost allocation for jurisdictional transmission providers of WestConnect and mandated that non-jurisdictional transmission providers (such as SMUD) identified as beneficiaries of a project have the ability to not accept the cost allocation. WestConnect’s Order 1000 planning process began with the 2016-2017 planning cycle.

A-64
<!-- Page 1258 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
However, in response to FERC’s WestConnect orders on compliance, El Paso Electric Company (“El Paso”), a jurisdictional transmission provider, petitioned to the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. El Paso contends that FERC’s WestConnect orders violate Order 1000’s cost causation principle because WestConnect’s binding cost allocation applies only to the jurisdictional transmission providers and thus forces jurisdictional transmission providers to subsidize projects benefiting non-jurisdictional transmission providers that opt-out of projects. The non-jurisdictional transmission providers agreed on a settlement with the jurisdictional transmission providers to resolve the matters on appeal in the 5th Circuit, but FERC ultimately did not accept the settlement. On August 2, 2023, the court reversed FERC’s orders implementing Order No. 1000 for WestConnect concerning cost allocation of regional transmission projects to non-jurisdictional transmission providers. The court found that the WestConnect orders are incompatible with Order No. 1000’s application of the cost causation principle to address free ridership. There is uncertainty at this time on the future of WestConnect’s regional planning process. FERC has not yet acted on its own in light of the Fifth Circuit’s decision, and it is uncertain whether it will act while it is working on an updated transmission planning and cost allocation proposal that could change the Order 1000 process (as further discussed below regarding the April 21, 2022 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking). It is also uncertain if and/or the extent to which the jurisdictional transmission providers in WestConnect will file revisions to the regional transmission planning provisions in their OATTs. In the meantime, the WestConnect planning has continued under the existing framework and SMUD, along with the other non-jurisdictional transmission providers, continue to participate in the WestConnect process. SMUD’s longstanding objective is to comply with open access requirements necessary to achieve reciprocity, including through participation in a regional planning process while binding itself to mandatory cost allocation. Thus, SMUD has an interest in continuing to explore options for participation in a regional transmission planning process if the WestConnect rules are modified to permit SMUD to reasonably participate consistent with its business and jurisdictional interests.

SMUD is unable to predict at this time the full impact that Order 1000, or the 5th Circuit’s August decision, will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the WestConnect process generally. However, WestConnect has conducted multiple planning cycles under its Order 1000 planning process and has not identified any project eligible for cost allocation. SMUD will continue to take any action necessary, including withdrawing from a cost allocation determination or planning region, and engaging in FERC proceedings, to ensure that it is not required to pay for transmission costs in the absence of an agreement or service relationship.

On April 21, 2022, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation and Generator Interconnection (the “NOPR”). The NOPR seeks input on proposals that would impact the Order 1000 planning and cost allocation process. SMUD has been engaged in the proceeding, providing input and helping draft comments with trade organizations, including LPPC. FERC has not issued any subsequent order. SMUD will continue to monitor and be engaged in any developments at FERC that impact the Order 1000 process and its regional transmission planning participation.

NERC Reliability Standards. The EPAct of 2005 required FERC to certify an electric reliability organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable reliability standards, subject to FERC review and approval. On February 3, 2006, FERC issued Order 672, which certified NERC as the ERO. Many reliability standards have since been approved by FERC, including those aimed at protecting the bulk electric system from physical and cyber threats.

The ERO or the regional entities, such as WECC, may enforce the reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight or FERC may independently enforce reliability standards. Potential monetary sanctions include fines of up to $1,544,521 per violation per day. Order 693 provides ERO and regional entities with

the discretion necessary to assess penalties for such violations, while also having discretion to calculate a penalty without collecting the penalty if circumstances warrant.

**Anti-Market Manipulation Rules.** EPAct of 2005 gave FERC the authority to issue rules to prevent market manipulation in jurisdictional wholesale power and gas markets, and in jurisdictional transmission and transportation services. These anti-market manipulation rules apply to non-jurisdictional entities such as SMUD. Further, EPAct of 2005 provided FERC civil penalty authority, which the Commission has stated that it will exercise carefully by assuring that its market manipulation rules are clear.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions.** Since 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions from different sources, including from the electric sector.

In 2014, EPA issued a proposed rule under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) called the Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”) that projected power sector emissions reductions of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed CPP would have established a rate-based emissions goal for each state, providing states the responsibility to develop a State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) describing how each will meet the goal assigned by EPA using the “Best System of Emissions Reduction” (“BSER”) established by EPA. The rule was finalized in October 2015.

In November 2015, 27 states and numerous corporations challenged the CPP in court, alleging that EPA had exceeded its authority under the CAA; however, before the issue could be decided by the court, the 2016 presidential election resulted in a change of administration. The new administration quickly moved for an abeyance (or stay) of the case for as long as the agency needed to review and withdraw the CPP. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP pending disposition in the D.C. Circuit and any subsequent review by the Supreme Court. In August 2018, EPA proceeded to withdraw the CPP and the D.C. Circuit ultimately dismissed the case on September 17, 2019. EPA proposed a different rule under the same provision of the CAA, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which would have established a BSER that only includes measures that can be undertaken at an individual power plant, rather than the broader suite of measures envisioned under the CPP. The ACE rule was challenged in court by environmental groups and states alleging that the revised rule inadequately responds to EPA’s responsibility to protect public health and welfare. SMUD joined in this litigation along with other challengers. The D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule on January 10, 2021, and remanded it to the EPA for review and revision, just days before a new presidential administration took office. Several states led by West Virginia and coal industry members appealed the decision.

In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in West Virginia v. EPA, striking down the CPP and foreclosing any future regulations of “significant political and economic significance” if Congress has not expressly authorized them. While the decision does not restrict EPA to only requiring measures “inside the fence line” at an individual power plant to control GHGs, it appears unlikely that the EPA will be able to require material reductions in GHGs to mitigate climate change through section 111(d) of the CAA.

Under the new presidential administration, in May 2023, the EPA issued a proposed rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA to reduce GHG emissions from existing and new power plants. The four-part proposed rule, **New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; and Repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy Rule**, would set both GHG emission standards for certain subcategories of new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants operating greater than 50% of the time and generating more than 300 MW per turbine. In the proposed rule, EPA determined the BSER is either deploying carbon capture and storage

technology to capture 90% of emissions or co-firing 96% hydrogen produced through a low-emission process (“low-GHG hydrogen”). If finalized, compliance is required by 2032. SMUD has filed comments as part of several trade groups and coalitions in response to the proposed rule. SMUD’s internal analysis shows the rule as proposed would not require changes at any of its currently-operating fossil-fueled power plants and therefore will not have a material impact on SMUD’s financial position, operations, or liquidity.

**Federal Communications Commission**

The 1978 Pole Attachment Act added section 224 to the Communications Act of 1934, authorizing the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to regulate attachments by cable television systems or providers of telecommunications service to utility poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way. Under Section 224(a)(1), public power entities are exempt from FCC pole attachment regulations, as municipally-owned poles are already subject to local decision-making processes and governance. The municipal exemption from FCC pole attachment regulations was further codified through the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, over the past decade, this exemption has been continuously eroded.

Various actions by the FCC have limited the exemption in support of a “uniform policy for broadband access to privately-owned physical infrastructure.” Through four orders issued between 2017 and 2018, the FCC set strict time limits for the review of pole attachment applications and preempted state and local agreements on pole attachments. In 2020, in *City of Portland v. United States*, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the FCC’s Small Cell Order, which adopted new time limits for municipal utilities’ review of wireless infrastructure siting applications and preempted access for small cell installations. In November 2023, the FCC adopted its Fourth Report and Order, Declaratory Ruling, and Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which proposed new rules and clarified the approval process for pole attachment applications, among other things. SMUD will monitor this proceeding for any potential impact to SMUD.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new FCC rulemakings will impact the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system.

**Federal Clean Energy Legislation.** SMUD actively participates in discussion at the federal level regarding legislation that would meaningfully impact SMUD’s existing GHG reduction strategies or impose new requirements for electric generators, including a proposed federal clean energy standard. In the 117th Congress, a clean electricity performance program was considered but ultimately lacked support to pass. Instead, Congress extended and expanded clean energy tax credits and created new grant and rebate programs to incentivize clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While it is possible that a future Congress may revisit the concept of a clean energy standard or other GHG reduction regime, it is possible that the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will diminish the likelihood of a new regulatory framework being enacted in the near future.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new EPA rulemakings will be undertaken, and what the full impact of the reduction of fossil-based generation over time will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the electric utility industry generally.

**State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings**

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills provide for reduced GHG emission standards and greater investment in energy efficient and environmentally friendly generation alternatives through more stringent RPS. Additionally, ongoing regulatory proceedings address the implementation of these bills as well as water flow and quality.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions.** On September 27, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (“AB 32”). AB 32 requires the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to adopt enforceable GHG emission limits and emission reduction measures in order to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In addition, AB 32 establishes a mandatory reporting program for all IOUs, local, publicly-owned electric utilities and other load-serving entities (electric utilities providing energy to end-use customers) (“LSEs”). The AB 32 reporting program allows CARB to adopt regulations using market-based compliance mechanisms such as a “cap-and-trade” system.

On December 16, 2010, CARB approved a resolution adopting cap-and-trade regulations for the State. The regulations became effective on January 1, 2012. As adopted, the cap-and-trade program covers sources accounting for 85% of the State’s GHG emissions, the largest program of its type in the United States. In November of 2012, CARB conducted its first allowance auction and auctions now occur on a quarterly schedule.

The cap-and-trade program introduced a hard emissions cap that declines over time on the combined electric utility and large industrial sectors, covering all sources emitting more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases (“CO2e”) per year, and was subsequently expanded to cover distributors of transportation, natural gas, and other fossil fuels. The cap-and-trade program requires covered entities to retire compliance instruments (allowances and carbon offsets) for each metric ton of CO2e they emit. CARB has allocated free allowances to LSEs to mitigate the compliance cost burden on ratepayers. The value of allowances must be used to benefit ratepayers and achieve GHG emission reductions. The cap-and-trade program also allows covered entities to offset their compliance obligation by using offsets, which represent 8% of a regulated entity’s compliance obligation through 2020, 4% from 2021 through 2025, and 6% from 2026 through 2030. Offsets must be obtained from certified projects in sectors that are not regulated under the cap-and-trade program and are subject to other restrictions.

The State's cap-and-trade program was briefly linked to companion program in the Canadian province of Ontario during 2018 but was de-linked following a political change. In 2021, the Washington state legislature passed a cap-and-trade bill, which is expected to interact with the State’s markets. Future potential near-term links to the CARB cap-and-trade program also include the states of Oregon, which has adopted a cap-and-trade program, and New Mexico, which is considering the adoption of a cap-and-trade program.

On October 7, 2015, SB 350 was enacted, containing aggressive goals for reducing carbon emissions by 2030, including raising the proportion of renewable energy to 50%, reducing the use of petroleum fuel in cars and trucks by up to 50%, and doubling the energy efficiency of existing buildings. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” for additional information. In addition, SB 350 established requirements for larger POUs to adopt and file with the CEC Integrated Resource Plans (“IRPs”) by April 2019 that would show planned procurement to achieve the 50% RPS and State GHG goals established by CARB. The CEC developed “guidelines” for these IRPs for POUs in 2017, updated them in 2018, and proposed additional updates in 2022. CARB established specific GHG target ranges for these IRPs in summer 2018, which were revised in 2023 following the adoption of CARB’s 2022 Scoping Plan. SMUD developed and adopted an IRP in 2018 through a comprehensive public process and filed the adopted IRP with the CEC in April 2019. SMUD adopted an updated IRP in June 2022 and filed the updated IRP with the CEC in September 2022, but the CEC has not yet completed its review of SMUD’s 2022 IRP. SMUD’s updated IRP plans for a greater than 92% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 relative to 1990 levels, which equals approximately

250,000 metric tons of GHG emissions in 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change.”

On April 29, 2015, the Governor of the State signed Executive Order B-30-15, establishing a goal for the State to reduce GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2016, the State Legislature passed Senate Bill 32 (“SB 32”), which codified then-Governor Brown’s goal of reducing the State’s GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2017, the State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 398 (“AB 398”), explicitly authorizing the continuation of the cap-and-trade program, with designated changes, through 2030. Subsequently, CARB adopted an initial set of regulatory changes extending the cap-and-trade program, including establishing utility sector allowance allocations through 2030. In 2018, CARB completed a rulemaking to implement the cap-and-trade program changes designated by AB 398. These changes include development of a hard price ceiling for the cap-and-trade program and two price-containment points below that ceiling, in an attempt to ensure stable prices in the program. CARB adopted final regulations on December 13, 2018.

In addition, any new projects constructed in the State, including power plants, that may cause a significant adverse impact on the environment must be analyzed under CEQA. Some State agencies have begun using CEQA in novel ways to require mitigation of “significant” GHG emissions caused, either directly or indirectly, by a project. Pursuant to Senate Bill 97 passed in 2007, CARB will assist the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research in setting thresholds of significance under CEQA of GHG impacts from new projects. This is an area of State law that is evolving and unsettled in the courts. However, there is a risk that any project proponent of an electric system infrastructure project might have to mitigate such potential impacts to a level of less than significant.

On December 3, 2012, the Superior Court issued a ruling in Environmental Defense Fund v. San Diego Association of Governments (“SANDAG”), Case No. 2100-00101593, that sided with the State Attorney General and the other petitioners stating that SANDAG did not follow CEQA when it adopted a $257 billion regional transportation plan in 2011. The ruling expressly invalidated the certification of the Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) on the grounds that the EIR should have analyzed the plan’s consistency with the governor’s policy goal to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050 as articulated in the 2005 Executive Order S-03-05. On November 24, 2014, the Fourth Appellate District upheld the trial court in a published decision, and SANDAG appealed to the State Supreme Court. On July 13, 2017, the Supreme Court reversed and held that SANDAG’s decision to not adopt the 2050 goal was not an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, the Court articulated three clear principles for agencies to follow in their CEQA review of planning documents: 1) agencies must take seriously the significance of even small increases in GHG emissions; 2) they must consider science-based State policy guidance in their decision-making; and 3) they are required to use the best scientific information available to determine whether their planning decisions are consistent with the State’s goals. These principles will apply to SMUD in CEQA reviews of future projects.

On September 29, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law Senate Bill 1368 (“SB 1368”), the GHG Emissions Performance Standard (“EPS”). SB 1368 limits long-term investments in baseload generation by the State’s utilities to power plants that meet an EPS jointly established by the CEC and the CPUC. The agencies have set the EPS at 1,100 pounds CO2 per MWh, which is roughly half of the CO2 emissions rate of a conventional coal-fired power plant. CEC regulations to implement the law for POUs were approved by the Office of Administrative Law on October 16, 2007.

SMUD’s primary supply and demand-side resources need to meet customers’ electric usage patterns over the next 10 years. Currently there is a ban in the State that prohibits the development of nuclear power plants until there is a permanent storage solution for spent fuel rods. With the effective ban on new coal power imports under SB 1368, natural gas-fired, combined cycle power plants would appear

A-69

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to be the primary viable option for fossil fuel-based baseload power plant development absent the implementation of new technologies in connection with other resource options. The reliance on a single fuel source will continue to put pressure on the natural gas market in the United States. SMUD has in place a natural gas procurement plan to mitigate natural gas volatility, see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply” above.

On September 16, 2022, the Governor of the State signed into law SB 1020, which creates interim climate targets under which eligible renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources must supply 90% of all retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers by December 31, 2035, and 95% by December 31, 2040. The bill also requires each State agency to ensure that zero carbon resources and eligible renewable energy resources supply 100% of electricity procured on its behalf by December 31, 2035. SMUD provides electricity to a number of State agency buildings and will work with State agencies to comply with this requirement.

On October 7, 2023, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 1305, which requires an entity that purchases or uses voluntary carbon offsets and makes claims regarding the achievement of net zero, or other similar claims, to disclose on their website specified information. Many stakeholder groups are raising questions on if this includes RECs. Clean-up legislation could follow. It is not clear at this time whether RECs are included.

Reliability. On June 30, 2022, the Governor signed the 2022-23 budget, along with a number of trailer bills, which provide implementing details on the budget line items. Included in AB 205, the energy trailer bill, are a number of reliability programs.

1. CEC Distributed Electricity Backup Assets Program to incentivize the construction of cleaner and more efficient distributed energy assets that would serve as on-call emergency supply or load reduction for the state’s electrical grid during extreme events. The CEC adopted program guidelines in October 2023 and issued the first solicitation in December 2023.

2. CEC Demand Side Grid Support Program to pay customers to reduce demand during stressed grid events. SMUD has actively engaged the CEC on the development and subsequent revision of program guidelines. The CEC is expected to revise the guidelines again for summer 2024.

3. DWR Strategic Reliability Reserve to secure resources for summer reliability or to preserve the option to extend the life of facilities that otherwise would retire, new temporary generators of more than five MW, new energy storage systems of at least 20 MW, generation facilities that use clean, zero-emission fuel technologies, or new zero-emission technologies that can be operational by December 31, 2026.

As a follow up to this legislation, the Governor signed into law AB 1373. The bill authorizes the CEC to annually assess a capacity payment on a POU within the CAISO balancing authority area during a month in which the POU fails to meet its minimum planning reserve margin. This does not include SMUD, who is within the BANC balancing authority area. SMUD is, however, required to submit to the CEC an assessment of whether it exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin and system resource adequacy requirements. This bill also allows the DWR, for certain types of long-development projects, to act as a central procurement entity. For POUs, participation in the DWR program would be optional.

Zero-Emission Fleet Mandates. CARB has adopted the Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”) regulation, requiring certain medium- and heavy-duty (“MHD”) vehicle fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles through purchase requirements or fleet composition requirements, which took effect on November

A-70
<!-- Page 1264 -->
1, 2023, and applies to all publicly owned MHD fleets, larger commercially owned MHD fleets, and drayage trucks. Under the ACF Rule, public fleets like SMUD have two compliance options. The first is a zero-emission vehicle (“ZEV”) purchase requirement, under which 50% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2024, and 100% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2027. The second is an optional ZEV milestone option, under which the composition of the MHD fleet would need to meet certain ZEV percentages starting in 2025, with the entire fleet transitioned no later than 2042. The individual milestones depend on the number and category of vehicles in the fleet. Public fleets may opt into the ZEV milestone option until January 1, 2030. In 2024, SMUD plans to comply with the purchase requirement option, meaning that 50% of the MHD vehicles would be ZEVs. SMUD plans to monitor ZEV market developments and currently expects to opt into the ZEV milestone option as more ZEVs become available. The ACF Rule also accelerates a manufacturer ZEV sales requirement to 100% of all MHD truck sales by the 2036 model year.

CARB proposed the Zero-Emission Forklift regulation in November 2023. The regulation would require forklift fleets to transition spark-ignited forklifts to zero-emission technology starting in 2026. The regulation would apply to SMUD, as a forklift operator. Since SMUD has a limited number of forklifts, this regulation is not expected to have a material effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operation.

Transportation and Building Electrification. In recent years, the State has identified transportation and building electrification as key strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, and is advancing policy to support or accelerate electrification. For example, in addition to the zero-emission fleet mandates and LCFS regulations discussed herein, CARB adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks regulations to require vehicle manufacturers to increase sales of zero-emission vehicles and equipment. The CEC’s Building Energy Efficiency Standards are also encouraging the use of electric heat pumps in new homes and certain non-residential buildings across the state. The draft 2025 Energy Standards, which are expected to be proposed by April 2024 and adopted by August 2024, would establish prescriptive heat pump requirements for both space and water heating in new homes, and may require existing homes to install a heat pump when replacing an air conditioner. The 2025 Energy Standards, if approved, would take effect on January 1, 2025. In addition, the State has also provided funding for programs to encourage clean transportation and building electrification.

Increases in transportation and building electrification will result in increased customer usage of electricity.

Renewables Portfolio Standard. Senate Bill 100 was passed by the Legislature and approved by Governor Brown on September 10, 2018. Among other requirements, the bill sets a 50% RPS target for 2026 and sets compliance period targets at 44% by December 31, 2024, 52% by December 31, 2027, and 60% by December 31, 2030. The bill also creates a statewide planning goal to meet all of the state’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.

Sacramento-San Joaquin River Bay-Delta Processes. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is an expansive inland estuary, formed at the western edge of the California Central Valley by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers (“Delta”). There are two substantial Delta planning processes with the potential to affect (1) energy available for SMUD’s purchase from the Central Valley Project (“CVP”) and (2) flows within the Upper American River watershed. These processes are called the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan (“Bay-Delta Plan”) and the Delta Conveyance Project.

The Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan is updated periodically by the State Water Resources Control Board (“SWRCB”), the last time being in 2006. The current Bay-Delta Plan update process is being implemented in four phases. The first phase considered southern Delta water quality, with a

A-71
<!-- Page 1265 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+not+displayed)  
significant focus on San Joaquin River tributaries. Phase 2, which is initially being addressed by a document under development by SWRCB staff, will address Sacramento River tributaries and various flow related issues, including the critically important one of those tributaries’ contribution to Delta outflow. Phase 3 will concern changes to water rights needed to implement Phase 2. A substantial change in Delta outflow requirements could have a major impact on the timing of hydroelectric energy generation by the CVP. SMUD has a long-term agreement with WAPA to purchase some of this power (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration”). On July 18, 2018, the SWRCB released an updated Framework document signaling its staff’s intent to propose Delta outflow requirements of 45-65% unimpaired flows for the Sacramento River tributaries (which includes the American River, the upper portions of which are where the AUR sits), though the report will analyze requirements of 35-75%. If these criteria were implemented, they could cut CVP generation by 50 to 63%. Governor Newsom has urged the SWRCB, other agencies and affected parties to execute voluntary agreements (aka the “Healthy Rivers Agreements”) to address species’ needs and outflow requirements. Although the negotiations have been slow, it is expected they will eventually result in a reasonable compromise. However, in September 2023 the SWRCB released a Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document in Support of Potential Updates to the Bay-Delta Plan (the “Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document”) to justify the adoption of the unimpaired flow standard as set forth in the 2018 Framework document. Numerous public entities, including SMUD, filed comments stating that, among other things, the potential updates identified in the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document, if adopted, would violate the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act and Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution, would not protect fish and wildlife, and would not reasonably protect all beneficial uses, including water supplies for millions of Californians and hydroelectric power generation that is essential to California’s resilient energy grid. Moreover, their comments also stated that the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document does not comply with CEQA because, among other things, the analysis of the proposed minimum flows and their impacts on electrical generation, greenhouse gas emissions, and generally electrical grid reliability, is not supported by substantial evidence and fails to satisfy informational requirements. In addition, the comments maintain that the Healthy Rivers Agreements are a superior approach to achieving the goal of maximizing both environmental and other beneficial uses. If the unimpaired flow standard is adopted and the Healthy Rivers Agreements do not come to fruition, SMUD plans to fully participate in all regulatory and legal proceedings to argue for consideration and minimization of impacts to hydropower generation. SMUD will assess the potential impacts of proposed modifications to the present outflow objectives on SMUD’s operations once, or if, the SWRCB makes available information with enough specificity for SMUD to conduct the relevant modeling.

In July 2022, the DWR released a Draft Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) to evaluate the potential impacts of carrying out the Delta Conveyance Project; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a separate Environmental Impact Statement to evaluate the effects of the project pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The Delta Conveyance Project is expected to entail construction of two intakes on the Sacramento River that will carry water to a main tunnel to the California Aqueduct for delivery south of the Delta. The Delta Conveyance Project may pose the potential to exacerbate impacts to already imperiled aquatic species, and in turn could have indirectly prompted regulatory agencies to require third parties, such as SMUD, to compensate by making changes to their operations. The Bureau of Reclamation is not a party to the Delta Conveyance Project, which should eliminate the potential for CVP power to be used to supply Delta Conveyance Project pumps. SMUD will monitor the proceedings and participate as necessary to ensure any impacts to SMUD interests are minimized, including potentially filing a challenge to the water rights DWR would need to modify in order to carry out the project.

Proposition 26. Proposition 26 was approved by the electorate on November 2, 2010 and amends Article XIII A and Article XIII C of the State Constitution. Proposition 26 imposes a two-thirds voter approval requirement for the imposition of fees and charges by the State, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. It also imposes a majority voter approval requirement on local governments with  
A-72

**A-73**

**respect to fees and charges for general purposes, and a two-thirds voter approval requirement with respect to fees and charges for special purposes, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. The initiative, according to its supporters, is intended to prevent the circumvention of tax limitations imposed by the voters pursuant to Proposition 13, approved in 1978, and other measures through the use of non-tax fees and charges. Proposition 26 expressly excludes from its scope a charge imposed for a specific local government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable cost to the local government of providing the service or product. Proposition 26 is not retroactive as applied to local governments. Although SMUD believes that the initiative was not intended to apply to fees for utility services such as those charged by SMUD and its fees and charges meet the criteria of the exclusion described above, it is possible that Proposition 26 could be interpreted to further limit fees and charges for electric utility services and/or require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes. SMUD is unable to predict at this time how Proposition 26 will be interpreted by the courts or what its ultimate impact will be. As of the date of this Official Statement, SMUD is unaware of any fees or charges relating to SMUD’s service that would have to be reduced or eliminated because of Proposition 26. However, certain of SMUD’s adopted rate increases have been challenged. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”**

**Initiative 1935.** A voter initiative entitled “The Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act” (“Initiative 1935”) has been determined to be eligible for the State’s November 2024 statewide general election and, unless withdrawn by its proponent prior to June 27, 2024, will be certified as qualified for the ballot in such election. Were it to be approved by a majority of voters in the election, Initiative 1935 would amend Article XIII C of the State Constitution to, among other things, provide that charges (or increases in charges) imposed or extended by a local government after January 1, 2022 for services or products provided directly to the payor (including, potentially, fees and charges for electric service or product) are “taxes” subject to voter approval unless the local government can provide convincing evidence that the charge is reasonable and does not exceed the “actual cost” of providing the service or product. Initiative 1935 defines “actual cost” as “(i) the minimum amount necessary to reimburse the government for the cost of providing the service or the product to the payor and (ii) where the amount charged is not used by the government for any purpose other than reimbursing that cost.” Initiative 1935 would also require that local governments impose fees and charges by ordinance (which may be subject to judicial interpretation). SMUD is unable to predict whether and how Initiative 1935, if approved, would be interpreted or applied, but it is possible any such interpretation or application could further limit fees and charges or further increase in fees and charges for electric utility services, require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes and/or otherwise adversely impact SMUD and its revenues. In response to an emergency petition filed by Governor Gavin Newsom, with support from the League of California Cities and others, the California Supreme Court has unanimously agreed to decide whether the initiative should appear on the November 2024 ballot or be disqualified. A ruling is expected before June 30, 2024, which is the deadline for placing items on the November 2024 ballot. 

**On November 2, 2023, Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 13 (“ACA 13”) was filed with the Secretary of State and will be on the ballot for the November 2024 statewide general election. If approved by voters, ACA 13 would require any initiative constitutional amendment appearing on the ballot on or after January 1, 2024, that would increase the voter approval requirement to adopt any State or local measure to be approved by the highest voter approval requirement that the initiative measure would impose. In other words, if ACA 13 is approved by voters, its express terms appear to require Initiative 1935 to pass with a 2/3 vote, since Initiative 1935 would extend a 2/3 voter requirement to additional State and local fees and charges. If adopted, ACA 13 and its effect on the adoption of Initiative 1935, if applicable, are likely to be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is not able to predict whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would be interpreted or applied or whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would affect the adoption, interpretation or application of Initiative 1935, if adopted.**

![Wildfire Legislation](https://example.com/image.png)

**Wildfire Legislation.** In response to catastrophic wildfires in California, legislation was adopted and signed into law requiring POUs (including SMUD), IOUs, and electrical cooperatives to construct, maintain and operate their electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by electrical lines and equipment. Senate Bill 247 (“SB 247”), signed by Governor Newsom on October 2, 2019, establishes notification, audit and reporting guidelines for electrical corporations relating to vegetation management requirements in the wildfire mitigation plan. SB 247 also specifies the qualifications for electrical line clearance tree trimmers performing work to comply with the vegetation management requirements in an electrical corporation’s wildfire mitigation plan and requires that qualified line clearance tree trimmers be paid no less than a specified prevailing wage rate. POUs are not required to adhere to SB 247, but the market impacts are projected to significantly increase SMUD’s annual vegetation management costs.

**Nonstock Security.** SMUD sponsored legislation in 2019, Assembly Bill 689, which was signed into law by Governor Newsom on September 5, 2019. This bill expressly allows SMUD the ability to operate a pilot project (effective January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2025), of up to three agencies, to hold nonstock security in a corporation or other private entity if acquired as part of a procurement of goods or services from that entity, provided that no separate funding is expended solely for the purposes of that property.

On September 15, 2022, the Board authorized the CEO & GM to enter into a joint collaboration agreement with ESS Tech, Inc. (“ESS”). Under that agreement SMUD would procure from ESS in flow batteries for utility scale long-duration energy storage applications. The agreement contemplates a multi-year phased deployment of up to 200MW/2GWh of long duration energy storage by 2028. As part of this procurement, SMUD acquired nonstock security in ESS.

SMUD will be sponsoring legislation in 2024 to extend the authority granted by Assembly Bill 689 to future years.

**Future Regulation**

The electric industry is subject to continuing legislative and administrative reform. States and Federal entities routinely consider changes to the way in which they regulate the electric industry. Recently, both further deregulation and forms of additional regulation have been proposed for the industry, which has been highly regulated throughout its history. SMUD is unable to predict at this time the impact any such proposals will have on the operations and finances of SMUD or the electric utility industry generally.

**OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY**

**CAISO Market Initiatives**

The CAISO routinely conducts a number of initiatives and stakeholder processes that propose certain operational and market changes that impact SMUD. SMUD does and will continue to monitor the various initiatives proposed by the CAISO and participate in its stakeholder processes to ensure that its interests are protected.

SMUD participates in the CAISO market for only a small percentage of energy needs, however, it continues to benefit from its participation in the CAISO’s WEIM and is currently exploring further participation in the CAISO’s proposed Extended Day Ahead Market (“EDAM”) (both the WEIM and EDAM are described further below). Along with monitoring other key market initiatives at the CAISO which impact wholesale energy markets, SMUD will continue to actively participate in all processes related

A-74
<!-- Page 1268 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to EIM and EDAM, to ensure both participation models are beneficial to SMUD’s customers. Given its success in EIM and active engagement with the CAISO and CAISO leadership, SMUD has earned a key role in the stakeholder processes related to these important and evolving markets.

**Resource Adequacy Filing**

In September 2005, the State Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Assembly Bill 380 (“AB 380”), which requires the CPUC to establish resource adequacy requirements for all LSEs within the CPUC’s jurisdiction. SMUD is not an LSE subject to the CPUC’s jurisdiction. In 2005, the CPUC issued a decision requiring jurisdictional LSEs to demonstrate that they have acquired capacity sufficient to serve their forecast retail customer load plus a minimum 15% planning reserve margin. In June 2022, the CPUC issued a decision increasing the minimum planning reserve margin to 16% for 2023 and 17% for 2024. In June 2023, the CPUC kept the minimum planning reserve margin at 17% for 2024 and extended the 17% requirement for 2025.

AB 380 also required publicly owned utilities, including SMUD, to meet the most recent resource adequacy standard as adopted by the WECC. The WECC has yet to formally adopt a resource adequacy requirement. However, consistent with current WECC practices, SMUD utilizes a minimum 15% planning reserve margin when assessing the need for future resources. For summer 2023, SMUD attained a 17% planning reserve margin and will have at least a 17% planning reserve margin for summer 2024 as well.

In 2022, the State Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 209 (2022) (“AB 209”), which requires the CEC to develop recommendations about approaches to determining an appropriate planning reserve margin for local publicly owned utilities within the CAISO balancing authority area. The CEC has initiated a proceeding and plans to publish a report with a recommended methodology on summer 2024. The report will not directly impact SMUD since SMUD is not in the CAISO; nevertheless, SMUD is monitoring the proceeding. The State Legislature also passed Assembly Bill 1373 (2023) (“AB 1373”) that requires the CEC to submit a report to the Legislature that assesses whether each local publicly owned electric utility in California (both inside and outside the CAISO) exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin for 2023. The report must also assess whether local publicly owned utilities met the planning reserve margin for June through September 2023 established by the CPUC’s June 2022 decision (i.e., 16%). See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Reliability.”

While SMUD believes the CEC’s report will show SMUD met both its 15% planning reserve margin and the CPUC’s 16% planning reserve margin for 2023, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the report, or what the Legislature intends to do with the report. To the extent the CEC or Legislature imposes a higher POU planning reserve margin for future years that includes SMUD, the ultimate impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy/capacity, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers; however, such impacts could be material.

**Western Energy Imbalance Market and Extended Day Ahead Market**

Federal and state policymakers have long-promoted the development of organized markets in the west as a means (among other reasons) to better integrate intermittent renewable resources into the electric system, the first of which markets is the Western EIM, operated by the CAISO. The CAISO successfully launched the WEIM, a real time only imbalance market, on October 1, 2014, with PacifiCorp as the first participant. Since this time, the WEIM has grown significantly with the addition of 21 other Balancing

to sell to nongovernmental entities electricity from generation projects and transmission service from transmission line projects financed with tax exempt obligations; (i) effects of inflation on the operating and maintenance costs of an electric utility and its facilities; (j) changes from projected future load requirements; (k) increases in costs and uncertain availability of capital; (l) issues relating to supply chains and the uncertain availability or increased costs of necessary materials; (m) shifts in the availability and relative costs of different fuels (including the cost of natural gas); (n) sudden and dramatic increases in the price of energy purchased on the open market that may occur at times of high peak demand in an area of the country experiencing such high peak demand, such as has occurred in the State; (o) issues relating to risk management procedures and practices with respect to, among other things, the purchase and sale of natural gas, energy and transmission capacity; (p) other legislative changes, voter initiatives, referenda and statewide propositions; (q) effects of changes in the economy; (r) effects of possible manipulation of the electric markets; (s) natural disasters or other physical calamities, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, droughts, severe weather, wildfires and floods; (t) changes to the climate, including increasing volatility in rainfall in the Western United States and a reduction in the depth and duration of the Sierra snowpack; (u) issues relating to cyber-security; and (v) outbreaks of infectious diseases or the occurrence of pandemics. Any of these factors (as well as other factors) could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of any given electric utility, including SMUD’s electric utility, and likely will affect individual utilities in different ways.

SMUD is unable to predict what impact such factors will have on the business operations and financial condition of SMUD’s electric system, but the impact could be significant. SMUD has taken major steps to mitigate the impacts of many of the changes. This Official Statement includes a brief discussion of certain of these factors. This discussion does not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and matters are subject to change subsequent to the date hereof. Extensive information on the electric utility industry is available from the legislative and regulatory sources and other sources in the public domain, and potential purchasers of any of SMUD’s Senior Bonds or Subordinated Bonds described in the forepart of this Official Statement should obtain and review such information.

## PROPOSED FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL

[Closing Date]

Northern California Energy Authority  
Sacramento, California  

Northern California Energy Authority  
Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Northern California Energy Authority (the “Issuer”) in connection with issuance of $__________ aggregate principal amount of Northern California Energy Authority Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”), issued pursuant to an amended and restated trust indenture, dated as of __________, 2024 (the “Trust Indenture”), between the Issuer and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association), as trustee (the “Trustee”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Trust Indenture.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Trust Indenture; the Commodity Purchase Agreement; the Commodity Supply Contract; the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 10, 2018, the Amended & Restated Schedule, dated as of __________, 2024, and the Amended and Restated Confirmation thereto, dated __________, 2024 (collectively, the “Issuer Commodity Swap”); each between the Issuer and Royal Bank of Canada (the “Commodity Swap Counterparty”); the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 10, 2018, the Amended & Restated Schedule, dated as of __________, 2024, the Amended & Restated Credit Support Annex, dated as of __________, 2024, and the Amended & Restated Confirmation thereto, dated __________, 2024 (collectively, the “Supplier Commodity Swap”), each between the Commodity Swap Counterparty; the Tax Certificate and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”); opinions of counsel to the Issuer, the Trustee and SMUD; certificates of the Issuer, the Trustee, SMUD and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not be, relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters. Our engagement with respect to the Bonds has concluded with their issuance, and we disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to us (whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than the Issuer. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents and the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to in the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Trust Indenture, the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract, the Issuer Commodity Swap, the Supplier Commodity Swap and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax.

purposes. We call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Bonds, the Trust Indenture, the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract, the Issuer Commodity Swap, the Supplier Commodity Swap and the Tax Certificate and their enforceability may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against joint powers authorities and municipal utility districts in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the assets described in or as subject to the lien of the Trust Indenture or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein or, of the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such assets. Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official Statement or other offering material relating to the Bonds and express no opinion with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1. The Bonds constitute the valid and binding limited obligations of the Issuer.

2. The Trust Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of, the Issuer. The Trust Indenture creates the valid pledge which it purports to create of the revenues, moneys, securities and funds comprising the Trust Estate pledged under the Trust Indenture, subject only to the provisions of the Trust Indenture permitting the application thereof for the purposes and on the terms

3. Interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax. We observe that interest on the Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds.

Faithfully yours,

ORRICK, HERRINGTON & SUTCLIFFE LLP

# APPENDIX G

## BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), New York, New York, will act as securities depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of the Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC. If, however, the aggregate principal amount of any maturity of the Bonds exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such maturity.

DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA-. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.

Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.

**G-2**  

**Representative of DTC.** The deposit of Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership.  

DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.  

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to take certain steps to augment transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Bond documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of the notices be provided directly to them.  

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within a maturity of the Bonds are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such maturity to be redeemed.  

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the issuer of securities as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).  

Redemption proceeds and payments of principal and interest on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from NCEA or the Trustee on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, NCEA or the Trustee, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds and principal and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of NCEA or the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.  

DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by giving reasonable notice to NCEA or the Trustee. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered.
<!-- Page 1278 -->
NCEA may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered to DTC.

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that NCEA believes to be reliable, but NCEA takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

The Issuer shall, as soon as practicable, but not later than ________, 2024, deliver to the Underwriter as many printed, conformed copies of the Official Statement as the Underwriter shall advise the Issuer are necessary to permit the Underwriter to comply with the requirements of Rule 15c2-12 and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”).

If, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriter, the preparation and publication of a supplement or amendment to the Official Statement is, as a result of such fact or event (or any other event which becomes known to the Issuer or the Underwriter during such period), necessary so that the Official Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and furnish a sufficient number of copies of such supplement or amendment to the Underwriter as is required for the Underwriter to comply with its obligations imposed by the SEC and the MSRB.

<!-- Page 1298 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

interests that differ from those of the Issuer; (ii) the Underwriter is not acting as a municipal advisor, financial advisor, or fiduciary to the Issuer and has not assumed any advisory or fiduciary responsibility to the Issuer with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby and the discussions, undertakings and procedures leading thereto (irrespective of whether the Underwriter has provided other services or is currently providing other services to the Issuer on other matters); (iii) the only obligations the Underwriter has to the Issuer with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby expressly are set forth in this Purchase Contract, provided that nothing in this Purchase Contract shall be construed to limit the Underwriter’s obligation of fair dealing under MSRB Rule G-17; and (iv) the Issuer has consulted its own financial and/or municipal, legal, accounting, tax and other advisors, as applicable, to the extent it deems appropriate. If the Issuer would like a municipal advisor in this transaction that has legal fiduciary duties to the Issuer, then the Issuer is free to engage a municipal advisor to serve in that capacity.

SECTION 12. ESTABLISHMENT OF PRICE.

(a) The Underwriter agrees to assist the Issuer in establishing the issue price of the Bonds and shall execute and deliver to the Issuer at Closing an “issue price” or similar certificate, together with the supporting pricing wires or equivalent communications, in such form as may be appropriate or necessary, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriter, the Issuer and Bond Counsel, to accurately reflect, as applicable, the sales price or prices or the initial offering price or prices to the public of the Bonds. All actions to be taken by the Issuer under this section to establish the issue price of the Bonds may be taken on behalf of the Issuer by PFM and any notice or report to be provided to the Issuer may be provided to PFM.

(b) The Issuer will treat the first price at which 10% of each maturity of the Bonds (the “10% test”) is sold to the public as the issue price of that maturity (if different interest rates apply within a maturity, each separate CUSIP number within that maturity will be subject to the 10% test). At or promptly after the execution of this Purchase Contract, the Underwriter shall report to the Issuer the price or prices at which it has sold to the public each maturity of Bonds. If at that time the 10% test has not been satisfied as to any maturity of the Bonds, the Underwriter agrees to promptly report to the Issuer the prices at which it sells the unsold Bonds of that maturity to the public. That reporting obligation shall continue, whether or not the Closing Date has occurred, until the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or until all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public.

(c) The Underwriter confirms that it has offered the Bonds to the public on or before the date of this Purchase Contract at the offering price or prices (the “initial offering price”), or at the corresponding yield or yields, set forth in Schedule I.

(d) The Underwriter confirms that there is no selling group agreement or retail distribution agreement relating to the initial sale of the Bonds.
<!-- Page 1299 -->
(e) The Underwriter acknowledges that sales of any Bonds to any person that is a related party to the Underwriter shall not constitute sales to the public for purposes of this section. Further, for purposes of this section:

(i) “public” means any person other than the Underwriter or a related party,

(ii) “underwriter” means (A) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the Issuer (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public and (B) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a person described in clause (A) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public),

(iii) a purchaser of any of the Bonds is a “related party” to the Underwriter if the Underwriter and the purchaser are subject, directly or indirectly, to (i) at least 50% common ownership of the voting power or the total value of their stock, if both entities are corporations (including direct ownership by one corporation of another), (ii) more than 50% common ownership of their capital interests or profits interests, if both entities are partnerships (including direct ownership by one partnership of another), or (iii) more than 50% common ownership of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation or the capital interests or profit interests of the partnership, as applicable, if one entity is a corporation and the other entity is a partnership (including direct ownership of the applicable stock or interests by one entity of the other), and

(iv) “sale date” means the date of execution of this Purchase Contract by all parties.

Any notice or other communication to be given to the Issuer under this Purchase Contract may be given by delivering the same in writing to the Issuer’s address set forth above, and any notice or other communication to be given to the Underwriter under this Purchase Contract may be given by delivering the same in writing to Goldman Sachs & Co.

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC  
New York, New York  

Northern California Energy Authority  
Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024  
(Supplemental Opinion)  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This letter is addressed to you, as Underwriter, pursuant to Section 8(e)(11) of the Bond Purchase Contract, dated [Pricing Date], 2024 (the “Purchase Contract”), between you and the Northern California Energy Authority (the “Issuer”), providing for the purchase of $000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Northern California Energy Authority Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”). The Bonds are being issued pursuant to an amended and restated trust indenture, dated as of [____] 1, 2024 (the “Trust Indenture”), between the Issuer and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Trust Indenture or, if not defined in the Trust Indenture, in the Purchase Contract.

We have delivered our final legal opinion (the “Bond Opinion”) as bond counsel to the Issuer concerning the validity of the Bonds and certain other matters, dated the date hereof and addressed to the Issuer. You may rely on such opinion as though the same were addressed to you.

In connection with our role as bond counsel to the Issuer, we have reviewed the Purchase Contract; the Trust Indenture; the Commodity Purchase Agreement; the Commodity Supply Contract; the Tax Certificate and Agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”), between the Issuer and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”); certain portions of the preliminary official statement of the Issuer, dated ____, 2024, with respect to the Bonds (the “Preliminary Official Statement”) and of the official statement of the Issuer, dated [Pricing Date], 2024, with respect to the Bonds (the “Official Statement”); opinions of counsel to the Issuer, the Trustee and SMUD; certificates of the Issuer, the Trustee, SMUD and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to provide the opinions or conclusions set forth herein.

Such opinions or conclusions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after the date hereof. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures.

**FORM OF OPINION OF GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE ISSUER**

[Closing Date], 2024

To the Addressees on  
Schedule I attached hereto

I have acted as general counsel to Northern California Energy Authority (the “Issuer”) in connection with its issuance of $000,000,000 Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”). This opinion is rendered pursuant to Section 8(e)(12) of the Bond Purchase Contract, dated [Pricing Date], 2024 (the “Bond Purchase Contract”), by and between Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (the “Underwriter”) and the Issuer. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this opinion shall have the same meanings assigned to them in the Bond Purchase Contract.

In rendering this opinion, I have examined originals or copies satisfactory to me of such records and other documents as I have deemed necessary and relevant as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, and the conformity of all original documents submitted to me as copies.

In giving the opinions expressed below I do not purport to be expert in or generally familiar with or qualified to express legal opinions based on the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of California (the “State”).

As to factual matters, I have relied solely upon the documents described herein, the representations and warranties of the Issuer contained in the Issuer Documents, the Preliminary Official Statement, the Official Statement, the JPA Agreement of the Issuer and various certificates and other documents furnished to me by Issuer’s officers and its Commission. In basing the opinions set forth in this letter on “my knowledge,” the words “my knowledge” signify that, in the course of my representation of the Issuer in connection with the issuance of the Bonds, no facts have come to my attention that would give me actual knowledge or actual notice that any such opinions or other matters are not accurate. Except as otherwise stated in this opinion, I have undertaken no investigation or verification of such matters.

Based upon the foregoing examination and review, I am of the opinion that:

1. The Issuer is a joint powers authority and public entity of the State of California, organized and existing pursuant to the provisions of the Joint Exercise of Powers Act, constituting Chapter 5 of Division 7 of Title 1 (commencing with Section 6500) of the California Government Code, as amended and supplemented (the

B-1
<!-- Page 1308 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image) 

“Act”), and a joint powers agreement, dated November 8, 2018 (the “JPA Agreement”), entered into between the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority, and has full legal right, power and authority under the Act and the JPA Agreement to (a) adopt the bond resolution adopted by it on __________, 2024 (the “Bond Resolution”), (b) execute and deliver the Official Statement, (c) enter into, execute and deliver the Issuer Documents, (d) sell, issue and deliver the Bonds to the Underwriter, and (e) carry out and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Issuer Documents and the Official Statement, and the Issuer has complied, and will at the Closing be in compliance in all respects, with the terms of the Act, the JPA Agreement and the Issuer Documents as they pertain to such transactions.

2. By all necessary official action, the Issuer has duly authorized all necessary action to be taken by it for (a) the adoption of the Bond Resolution, (b) the issuance and sale of the Bonds, (c) the approval, execution and delivery of, and the performance by the Issuer of the obligations on its part, contained in the Bonds and the Issuer Documents, and (d) the consummation by it of all other transactions contemplated by the Official Statement and the Issuer Documents.

3. The Bond Resolution was duly and validly adopted by the Issuer and all other proceedings pertinent to the validity and enforceability of the Bonds have been duly and validly adopted or undertaken in compliance with all applicable procedural requirements of the Issuer and in compliance with the Constitution and laws of the State, including the Act and the JPA Agreement, and the Bond Resolution is in full force and effect and has not been amended.

4. The Issuer Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer, and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws and equitable principles of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against public entities in the State; and the Bonds, when issued, delivered and paid for, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and are enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other similar laws and principles of equity relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against public entities in the State; and upon the issuance, authentication and delivery of the Bonds as aforesaid, the Indenture will provide, for the benefit of the holders, from time to time of the Bonds and the Commodity Swap Counterparty the legally valid and binding pledge of and lien it purports to create as set forth therein.

5. The distribution of the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement has been duly authorized by the Issuer.

B-2
<!-- Page 1309 -->
6. All authorizations, approvals, licenses, permits, consents and orders of any governmental authority, legislative body, board, agency or commission having jurisdiction of the matter which are required for the due authorization of, which would constitute a condition precedent to, or the absence of which would materially adversely affect the due performance by the Issuer of its obligations under the Issuer Documents and the Bonds have been obtained.

7. To my knowledge as general counsel of the Issuer since its inception, there is no legislation, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at law or in equity, before or by any court, government agency, public board or body, pending or, to my knowledge, threatened against the Issuer, affecting the existence of the Issuer or the titles of its officers to their respective offices, or affecting or seeking to prohibit, restrain or enjoin the sale, issuance or delivery of the Bonds or the collection of the Revenues (as defined in the Indenture) pursuant to the Bond Resolution or the Indenture or in any way contesting or affecting the validity or enforceability of the Bonds or the Issuer Documents, or contesting the exclusion from gross income of interest on the Bonds for federal income tax purposes or contesting in any way the completeness or accuracy of the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement or any supplement or amendment thereto, or contesting the powers of the Issuer or any authority for the issuance of the Bonds, the adoption of the Bond Resolution or the execution and delivery of the Issuer Documents, nor, to my knowledge, is there any basis therefor, wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Issuer Documents.

8. The execution and delivery of the Issuer Documents and compliance by the Issuer with the provisions thereof, under the circumstances contemplated herein and therein, will not conflict with or constitute on the part of the Issuer a material breach of or a default under any agreement or instrument to which the Issuer is a party, or violate any existing law, administrative regulation, court order, or consent decree to which the Issuer is subject.

9. To my knowledge, the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement under the captions “NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY,” “CONTINUING DISCLOSURE” and “LITIGATION” are true and accurate in all material respects.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, the foregoing opinion is expressly made subject to the following exceptions, qualifications, and assumptions:

(i) I express no opinion with respect to the validity or enforceability of any provisions of the Issuer Documents or any other documents concerning any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, or severability provisions contained therein.

B-3
<!-- Page 1310 -->
(ii) I express no opinion as to the enforceability of provisions waiving, directly or indirectly, expressly or impliedly, defenses to obligations or rights granted by law, where such waivers are prohibited by law or are against public policy.

(iii) I except from my opinion any provisions contained in any document which purport to prevent any party from raising an affirmative defense thereto, such as estoppel, illegality, etc., if such affirmative defense arises or is asserted to have arisen out of any action by any party which has not been brought to my attention, or which purports to prevent any party from raising a claim of fraud.

(iv) I except from my opinion any provisions contained in any of the documents which could be construed as waiving service of process or any applicable statute of limitations defense or which establish any rights to specific performance.

(v) My opinion as to enforceability is limited by standards of good faith, fair dealing, materiality, and reasonableness that may be applied by a court to the exercise of certain rights and remedies; limitations based on statutes or on public policy limiting a person’s right to waive the benefit of statutory provisions or of a common law right; and limitations releasing a party from or indemnifying a party against liability for its own wrongful or negligent act when such release or indemnification is contrary to public policy.

(vi) My opinion is limited to the matters stated herein and no opinion may be inferred or implied beyond the matters expressly stated herein. The opinions expressed in this letter are given solely for your use and benefit in connection with the transactions referred to herein and no other person may use or rely on this opinion letter, nor may it be used, relied upon or circulated or quoted in relation to any other transaction which is not related to transactions referred to herein, without my prior express written consent. This opinion is provided to you as a legal opinion only and not as a warranty or guarantee with respect to the matter described herein or in the documents referred to herein.

(vii) The scope of this opinion is limited to those issues and parties specifically considered herein and no further or more expansive opinion is implied or should be inferred from any opinion expressed herein. On such basis, any variation or difference in the facts upon which this opinion is based might affect my conclusions in an adverse manner and make them inaccurate.

Respectfully submitted,
