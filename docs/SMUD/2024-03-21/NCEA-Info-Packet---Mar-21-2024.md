### NARRATIVE:

**Requested Action**:  
Approve amendments to the 2024 Northern California Energy Authority (NCEA) Budget Resolution to i) combine and relabel the Interest Expense and Bond Principal line items to the single line item Debt Service (Interest and Principal) and augment the line item by $12,983,277 and ii) augment the Administrative & General line item by $15,000,000.

**Summary**:  
NCEA is a Joint Powers Authority (JPA), formed by SMUD and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority (SFA) in 2018. NCEA issued five-year put bonds and used the proceeds to enter into a commodity prepayment agreement with J Aron and Company for a 30-year supply of fuel or electricity, with a mandatory price of July 1, 2024. NCEA has also entered into a Commodity Supply Contract with SMUD that provides for the sale of the fuel or electricity to SMUD. In 2024, NCEA will up the augmented budget amount to remarket the bonds and extend the commodity supply agreement which requires augmenting the previously approved 2024 budget; the Administrative & General line item is conservatively high to account for uncertainty primarily due to changing market conditions, and how accounting rules might require the costs to be classified. The budget change is applicable only to NCEA, while SMUD’s budget is unaffected. SMUD’s 2024 Budget Commodity line item includes the cost of the commodities to be purchased from NCEA. NCEA will use proceeds from the commodities sales to SMUD, combined with swap cash flow settlements, to pay for interest and principal on the NCEA bonds.

**Board Policy (Number & Title)**:  
Strategic Direction SD-2, Competitive Rates, Strategic Direction SD-3, Access to Credit Markets, Strategic Direction SD-4, Reliability. The NCEA budget will support SD-2, SD-3 and SD-4 by providing a reliable and discounted supply of fuel for SMUD’s thermal generating plants. The 2024 Budget provides for the payment of interest, principal, trustee fees on the NCEA bonds, bond issuance costs and other administrative costs.

**Benefits**:  
Approval of the amendment to the 2024 NCEA Budget Resolution meets the requirements of the Municipal Utility District (MUD) Act and will authorize debt service, trustee fee and other administrative payments within the limits prescribed.

**Cost/Budgeted**:  
Approval of the amendment to the 2024 NCEA Budget Resolution will authorize debt service and administrative payments within the limit prescribed.

**Alternatives**:  
Approval of a budget is required before June 1, 2024, or NCEA will not have authority to carry out fuel transactions nor make required debt service payments.

**Affected Parties**:  
Budget Office, Accounting, Treasury, Power Generation, Energy Trading & Contracts, Legal.

**Requested Action:**  
Approve the issuance of Northern California Energy Authority (NCEA) Commodity Prepay Bonds and authorize the Chief Executive Officer & General Manager to execute documents necessary to complete the issuance of the bonds and various contracts related to the prepayment of the commodities.

**Summary:**  
NCEA issued 30 year commodity prepay bonds in 2018 for an initial 5-year term. NCEA is now refunding and extending the original transaction to a new 30 year term with an initial put bond with a five to eight year term. The refunding and extension will allow NCEA to pass on as much as $3 million savings annually to SMUD, depending on market conditions at pricing. The commodity prepay bonds allow for maximum flexibility where SMUD can receive fuel, electricity, or novate an existing renewable power purchase agreement or novate a supply of biogas. The maximum par value of the bonds/notes combined will be approximately $850 million, with a maximum coupon of 5%.

SD-2 Competitive Rates, SD-3 Access to Credit Markets  

**Benefits:**  
Bond proceeds will be used to prepay Goldman Sachs for delivery of commodities at a discount to index over a 30-year period.

Subject: Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024  
Government Code Section 5852.1  
Good Faith Estimate of Cost for the Bond Transaction  

**General Background Information**  
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) DBA as Northern California Energy Authority intends to execute a bond transaction in the Spring of 2024, the Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024, subject to market conditions. The purpose of this transaction is to refund the Commodity Supply Revenue Bonds, Series 2018 of which $537.3 million remain outstanding. This transaction is a natural gas prepayment transaction with the 2018 Bonds having a mandatory purchase date of July 1, 2024. In addition to this refunding, NCEA has added additional gas volumes to the prepayment, increasing the amount of par issued with this transaction. Goldman Sachs is the sole senior manager for this transaction.  

Based on market conditions in the end of February, PFM believes the following information pertains to the underwriter's discount and cost of issuance for this planned transaction:  
<!-- Page 12 -->
| NCEA Transaction                                   | Amount         |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Expected Par                                      | 672,310,000    |
| Underwriter Discount, Takedown                    | 2,689,240      |
| Underwriter's Discount, Management Fee            | 336,155        |
| Other Underwriter Expense                          | 336,355        |
| **Total Underwriter's Discount** ¹                | **3,361,750**  |
| Other Compensation Received, Related Party         |                |
| Prepayment LLC Fee                                | 9,800,000      |
| Fee for Natural Gas Delivery (per MMBtu)         | TBD            |
| **Additional Other Compensation**                  | **9,800,000**  |
| **Cost of Issuance**                              | 1,250,000      |
| **Total, day of delivery expenses**                |                |
| (includes Total Underwriter's Discount and        |                |
| Cost of Issuance and excludes related party      |                |
| compensation)                                     | **4,611,750**  |

¹ Underwriter's discount does not include additional compensation received by Goldman Sachs through related party transactions

PFM does note that there are other related party forms of compensation not technically characterized as "Underwriter's Discount", typical for Commodity Pre-pay transactions that incorporate a Limited Liability Corporation ("LLC"). Based on initial Goldman Sachs modeling and through other Goldman Sachs prepayments with a similar LLC structure, there is a fee, scalable to the final size of the transaction. It is expected that for NCEA, this will be ~$9.8 million that is incorporated into the prepayment cashflows. This amount largely reflects two items:
- An equity amount necessary to initially capitalize the LLC
- A "revenue offset" process at Goldman Sachs. Basically, the expected NCEA counterparty is a Goldman Sachs client that will not need to raise capital with their Goldman Sachs counterparty. Hence, this is a transfer to that profit center to make that side of Goldman Sachs whole through this prepay transaction.

Finally, there is another stream of related party revenue. J. Aron, a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, will receive revenues in the form of a "Reservation Charge / Administration Fee" for the coordination required for commodity delivery. This will likely be received for as long as J. Aron is involved in the transaction and is based on the quantity of the commodity received.

Any Authorized Officer is hereby authorized and directed, for and on behalf of the Issuer, to execute and deliver the Interest Rate Swap Agreements in substantially said forms, with such changes and insertions therein as the Authorized Officer executing the same may approve, such approval to be conclusively evidenced by the execution and delivery thereof.

Aron, including the guarantee of the obligations of J. Aron under the Interest Rate Swap Agreements by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and that the Interest Rate Swap Agreements are designed to reduce the amount or duration of rate, spread or similar risk when used in combination with the issuance of the Bonds and to enhance the relationship between risk and return with respect to the gas and electricity purchase program financed with the proceeds of the Bonds, and, in particular, to reduce the rate, spread or similar risk between the fixed payments received under the Commodity Swap Agreement and the variable interest rate payments on one or more series of the Bonds.

**Section 8.** The Bonds, when executed as provided in Section 1, shall be delivered to the Trustee for authentication by the Trustee. The Trustee is hereby requested and directed to authenticate the Bonds by executing the Trustee’s Certificate of Authentication appearing thereon, and to deliver the Bonds, when duly executed and authenticated, to the purchaser or purchasers thereof in accordance with written instructions executed on behalf of the Issuer by an Authorized Officer, which any Authorized Officer, acting alone, is authorized and directed, for and on behalf of the Issuer, to execute and deliver to the Trustee.

**Interest Rate Determination**  
Interest at the Weekly Interest Rate, which shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent by no later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday of each week during such Weekly Interest Rate Period, or if such day shall not be a Business Day, then on the next succeeding Business Day. The Weekly Interest Rate for each Weekly Interest Rate Period shall be determined on or prior to the first day of such Weekly Interest Rate Period and shall apply to the period commencing on the first day of such Weekly Interest Rate Period and ending on the next succeeding Wednesday (whether or not a Business Day). Thereafter, each Weekly Interest Rate shall apply to the period commencing on Thursday (whether or not a Business Day) and ending on the next succeeding Wednesday (whether or not a Business Day), unless such Weekly Interest Rate Period shall end on a day other than Wednesday, in which event the last Weekly Interest Rate for such Weekly Interest Rate Period shall apply to the period commencing on Thursday (whether or not a Business Day) preceding the last day of such Weekly Interest Rate Period and ending on the last day of such Weekly Interest Rate Period. The Weekly Interest Rate shall be the rate of interest per annum determined by the Remarketing Agent to be the minimum interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series, would enable the Remarketing Agent to sell the Bonds of such Series on the effective date of such rate at a price (without regarding accrued interest) equal to not less than 100% of the principal amount thereof. In the event that the Remarketing Agent fails to establish a Weekly Interest Rate for any week, then the Weekly Interest Rate for such week shall be the same as the Weekly Interest Rate for the immediately preceding week if the Weekly Interest Rate for such preceding week was determined by the Remarketing Agent. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(d), in the event that the Weekly Interest Rate for the immediately preceding week was not determined by the Remarketing Agent, or in the event that the Weekly Interest Rate determined by the Remarketing Agent shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of law, then the interest rate for such week shall be equal to the SIFMA Index on the day such Weekly Interest Rate would otherwise be determined as provided herein for such Weekly Interest Rate Period.

**(b) Conversion to Weekly Interest Rate Period.** Subject to Section 2.10, at any time, the Issuer, in a Written Direction of the Issuer delivered to the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent (if any), may elect that a Series of Bonds shall bear interest at a Weekly Interest Rate. Such direction of the Issuer shall specify (i) the proposed effective date of such Conversion to a Weekly Interest Rate Period, which shall be (A) a Business Day not earlier than the 30th day following the second Business Day after receipt by the Trustee of such Written Direction of the Issuer, (B) in the case of a Conversion from a Daily Interest Rate Period, a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, an Index Rate Period or a Fixed Rate Period, the day immediately following the last day of such Interest Rate Period, or (C) in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture; and (ii) the date of delivery for such Bonds to be purchased on the effective date of such Conversion to a Weekly Interest Rate Period. In addition, such direction shall be accompanied by a form of notice required by Section 2.6(c) and a letter of Bond Counsel that it expects to be able to give a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the effective date of the Conversion to the Weekly Interest Rate Period. During each Weekly Interest Rate Period commencing on a date so specified and ending on the day immediately preceding the effective date of the next succeeding Interest Rate Period, the interest rate borne by the applicable Series of Bonds shall be a Weekly Interest Rate.

<!-- Page 63 -->
(c) Notice of Conversion to Weekly Interest Rate. The Trustee shall give notice by first-class mail of a Conversion to a Weekly Interest Rate Period to the Owners of the Bonds of the applicable Series not less than 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of such Weekly Interest Rate Period. Such notice shall state: (i) that the Interest Rate Period on such Bonds will be converted to a Weekly Interest Rate unless Bond Counsel fails to deliver a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel as to such Conversion on the applicable Conversion Date; (ii) the proposed Conversion Date to the Weekly Interest Rate Period; and (iii) that the Bonds of the applicable Series are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the proposed Conversion Date and setting forth the applicable Purchase Price and the place of delivery for purchase of such Bonds.

Section 2.7 Fixed Rate Period. (a) Determination of Fixed Rate. During and in connection with a Fixed Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, (i) the Issuer may by Written Notice to the Trustee establish one or more Maturity Dates for the Bonds of such Series, and (ii) each maturity of such Bonds shall bear interest at a Fixed Rate. The Fixed Rate shall be determined by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as the case may be, on a Business Day no later than the Issue Date or the Fixed Rate Conversion Date for such Series of Bonds, as applicable. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.7(d), each Fixed Rate shall be the rate of interest per annum determined by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as the case may be, to be the minimum interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series and maturity, would enable the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as the case may be, to sell the Bonds of such Series and a maturity on such date at a price (without regard to accrued interest) equal to the principal amount thereof. If, for any reason, with respect to any Series of Bonds being converted to a Fixed Rate Period, the Fixed Rate for such Fixed Rate Period is not determined by the Remarketing Agent on or prior to the first day of such Fixed Rate Period, then the Interest Rate Period for the Bonds of the applicable Series shall be a Weekly Interest Rate Period and such Weekly Interest Rate Period shall continue until such time as the Interest Rate Period for such Series of Bonds shall have been converted to a Daily Interest Rate Period, a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, a Fixed Rate Period or an Index Rate Period as provided herein.

(b) Conversion to or Continuation of Fixed Rate Period.

(i) Subject to Section 2.10, at any time, the Issuer, in a Written Direction of the Issuer delivered to the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent (if any), may elect that the Bonds of a Series shall bear interest at a Fixed Rate. Such direction of the Issuer (A) shall specify the proposed effective date of the Fixed Rate Period, which date shall be (1) a Business Day not earlier than the 30th following receipt by the Trustee of such Written Direction of the Issuer, (2) the day immediately following the last day of the Interest Rate Period then in effect, or (3) in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture; (B) shall specify the last day of such Fixed Rate Period, which day shall be either the day immediately prior to the Final Maturity Date for the applicable Series of Bonds, or a day which both immediately precedes a Business Day and is at least 181 days after the effective date of Fixed Rate Period; and (C) with respect to any such Fixed Rate Period, may specify redemption prices and periods different than those set forth in this Indenture or the applicable Supplemental Indenture providing for the issuance of

(ii) The day following the last day of any Fixed Rate Period for a Series of Bonds shall be a Fixed Rate Tender Date for such Bonds.

(iii) The election of the Issuer described in Section 2.7(b)(i) shall be accompanied by a letter or letters of Bond Counsel and/or Special Tax Counsel that it expects to be able to give a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the Fixed Rate Conversion Date and by a form of the notice to be mailed by the Trustee to the Owners of the Bonds of the applicable Series as provided in Section 2.7(c).

(iv) If, by the 29th day prior to the last day of any Fixed Rate Period that ends on a day other than the day immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the applicable Series of Bonds, the Trustee shall not have received Written Notice of the Issuer’s election that, during the next succeeding Interest Rate Period, the Bonds of such Series shall bear interest at a Daily Interest Rate, a Weekly Interest Rate, a Fixed Rate, an Index Rate or CP Interest Term Rates, then the Bonds of the applicable Series shall be purchased on the applicable Mandatory Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.13 and the Bonds shall not be remarketed.

(v) After the Final Fixed Rate Conversion Date for a Series of Bonds, the Bonds of the applicable Series shall no longer be subject to or have the benefit of the provisions of Section 4.11 through Section 4.22.

(c) Notice of Conversion to or Continuation of Fixed Rate. The Trustee shall give notice of a Conversion to a (or the establishment of another) Fixed Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to the Owners of the Bonds of such Series not less than 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of such Fixed Rate Period. Such notice shall state: (i) that the Interest Rate Period for such Bonds shall be converted to, or continue to be, a Fixed Rate Period unless Bond Counsel fails to deliver a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel as to such Conversion on the Fixed Rate Conversion Date; (ii) the proposed Fixed Rate Conversion Date; and (iii) that such Bonds are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the Fixed Rate Conversion Date and setting forth the applicable Purchase Price and the place of delivery for purchase of such Bonds.

(d) Sale at Premium or Discount. As set forth in Section 2.4(a), the Series 2024 Bonds of each maturity have been sold with an initial issue premium. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.7(a), the Fixed Rate for each maturity of any other Series of Bonds as initially issued, or Fixed Rate for each maturity of any other Series of Bonds upon Conversion to a Fixed Rate Period, shall be the rate of interest per annum determined by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, to be the interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series, would enable the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, to sell such Bonds at a price (without regard to accrued interest) which will result in the lowest net interest cost for such Bonds, after taking into account any premium or discount at which such Bonds are sold by the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, provided that:

(a) Determination of CP Interest Terms and CP Interest Rates.** During each Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, each Bond of such Series shall bear interest during each CP Interest Term for such Bond and the CP Interest Term Rate for such Bond. The CP Interest Term and the CP Interest Term Rate for each Bond need not be the same for any two Bonds of such Series, even if determined on the same date. Each of such CP Interest Terms and CP Interest Term Rates for each Bond shall be determined by the Remarketing Agent no later than the first day of each CP Interest Term. Each CP Interest Term shall be for a period of days within the range or ranges announced as possible CP Interest Terms no later than 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on the first day of each CP Interest Term by the Remarketing Agent. Each CP Interest Term for each Bond of the applicable Series shall be a period of not more than 180 days, determined by the Remarketing Agent to be the period which, together with all other CP Interest Terms for all Bonds of the applicable Series then Outstanding, will result in the lowest overall interest expense on such Bonds over the next succeeding one hundred eighty (180) days. Each CP Interest Term shall end on either a day which immediately precedes a Business Day or on the day immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the applicable Series of Bonds. If, for any reason, a CP Interest Term for any Bond cannot be so determined by the Remarketing Agent, or if the determination of such CP Interest Term is held by a court of law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such CP Interest Term shall be thirty (30) days, but if the last day so determined shall not be a day immediately preceding a Business Day, such CP Interest Term shall end on the first day immediately preceding the
<!-- Page 66 -->

Business Day next succeeding such last day, or if such last day would be after the day immediately preceding the Final Maturity Date for the applicable Series of Bonds, shall end on the day immediately preceding such Final Maturity Date. In determining the number of days in each CP Interest Term, the Remarketing Agent shall take into account the following factors: (i) existing short-term, tax-exempt market rates and indices of such short-term rates; (ii) the existing market supply and demand for short-term tax-exempt securities; (iii) existing yield curves for short-term and long-term tax-exempt securities for obligations of credit quality comparable to the Bonds of the applicable Series; (iv) general economic conditions; (v) industry economic and financial conditions that may affect or be relevant to the Bonds of the applicable Series; (vi) the CP Interest Terms of other Bonds of the applicable Series; and (vii) such other facts, circumstances and conditions pertaining to financial markets as the Remarketing Agent, in its sole discretion, shall determine to be relevant.

The CP Interest Term Rate for each CP Interest Term for each Bond in a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period shall be the rate of interest per annum determined by the Remarketing Agent to be the minimum interest rate which, if borne by such Bond, would enable the Remarketing Agent to sell such Bond on the effective date of such rate at a price equal to the principal amount thereof. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.10(d), if, for any reason, a CP Interest Term Rate for any bond in a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period is not so established by the Remarketing Agent for any CP Interest Term, or if such CP Interest Term Rate is determined by a court of law to be invalid or unenforceable, then the CP Interest Term Rate for such CP Interest Term shall be a rate per annum equal to the SIFMA Index on the first day of such CP Interest Term.

(b) Conversion to Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period. Subject to Section 2.10, at any time, the Issuer, in a Written Direction of the Issuer to the Trustee and the Remarketing Agent (if any), may elect that a Series of Bonds shall bear interest at CP Interest Term Rates. Such Written Direction of the Issuer shall specify (i) the proposed effective date of the Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, which shall be (A) a Business Day not earlier than the thirtieth (30th) day following the second Business Day after receipt by the Trustee of such direction, (B) the day immediately following the last day of the Interest Rate Period then in effect, or (C) in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture; and (ii) the date of delivery of such Bonds to be purchased. In addition, the Written Direction of the Issuer shall be accompanied by (i) a letter of Bond Counsel that it expects to be able to give a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the Conversion Date, and (ii) a form of the notice to be mailed by the Trustee to the Owners of the Bonds of the applicable Series as provided in Section 2.8(c). During each Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period commencing on the date so specified and ending on the day immediately preceding the effective date of the next succeeding Interest Rate Period, each Bond of such Series shall bear interest at a CP Interest Term Rate applicable to the CP Interest Term then in effect for such Bond.

(c) Notice of Conversion to CP Interest Term Rates. The Trustee shall give notice by first-class mail of a Conversion to a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period to the Owners of the Bonds of the applicable Series not less than 30 days prior to the proposed effective date of such Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period. Such notice shall state: (i) that such Bonds shall bear interest at CP Interest Term Rates unless Bond Counsel fails to deliver a Favorable Opinion of

Bond Counsel as to such Conversion on the Conversion Date or other conditions precedent to such adjustment are not met; (ii) the proposed Conversion Date; and (iii) that such Bonds are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on such proposed Conversion Date, regardless of whether any or all conditions precedent to such Conversion are met, and setting forth the applicable Purchase Price and the place of delivery for purchase of such Bonds.

(d) **Conversion from Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period.** Subject to Section 2.10(b), at any time during a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, the Issuer may elect, pursuant to Section 2.5(b), Section 2.6(b), Section 2.7(b) or Section 2.9(c), that such Bonds no longer shall bear interest at CP Interest Term Rates and shall instead bear interest at a Daily Interest Rate, a Weekly Interest Rate, a Fixed Rate or an Index Rate, as specified in such election. In connection with any such election, and notwithstanding any provision contained in this Section 2.8 to the contrary, each CP Interest Term established by the Remarketing Agent for the Bonds shall end on the same date in order to facilitate the Conversion of such Bonds. The date on which all CP Interest Terms determined for the Bonds end shall be the last day of the then-current Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period and the day next succeeding such date shall be the effective date of the Daily Interest Rate Period, Weekly Interest Rate Period, Fixed Rate Period or Index Rate Period elected by the Issuer for such Bonds.

**Section 2.9 Index Rate Periods.** (a) **Determination of Applicable Spread.** In connection with the issuance of a Series of Bonds bearing interest at an Index Rate, or the Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to an Index Rate Period, the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, shall determine the Applicable Spread and, if applicable, the Applicable Factor, and shall specify the same in the Index Rate Determination Certificate for the applicable Index Rate Period. The Applicable Spread and any Applicable Factor for an Index Rate Period shall be such amount or percentage as shall result in the minimum interest rate which, if borne by the Bonds of the applicable Series as of the first day of the applicable Index Rate Period, under Prevailing Market Conditions, would enable the Underwriter or the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, to sell the Bonds at a price equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate principal amount of such Bonds on the first day of the applicable Index Rate Period.

(b) **Determination of Index Rate.**

(i) During any Index Rate Period for a Series of Bonds, such Bonds shall bear interest at an Index Rate, as specified in the applicable Index Rate Determination Certificate delivered to the Trustee on or before the first day of such Interest Rate Period.

(ii) With respect to each SIFMA Index Rate Period, the Calculation Agent shall (A) determine the SIFMA Index by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on each Wednesday or, if such Wednesday is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately succeeding such Wednesday, and (B) determine the SIFMA Index Rate at or before 12:00 noon, New York City time, on each Index Rate Reset Date. The Calculation Agent shall furnish each SIFMA Index Rate so determined to the Issuer and the Trustee by Electronic Means not later than each Index Rate Reset Date.

(iii) With respect to each SOFR Index Rate Period, the Calculation Agent shall (A) determine and provide to the Trustee by Electronic Means the SOFR Index by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on each SOFR Publish Date, and (B) determine and provide to the Trustee by Electronic Means the SOFR Index Rate at or before 12:00 noon, New York City time, on each SOFR Effective Date.

(iv) During any Index Rate Period, interest shall be computed on the basis of a 365 or 366-day year and actual days elapsed. The Calculation Agent shall calculate and provide by Electronic Means to the Issuer and the Trustee the amount of interest due and payable on each Series of Bonds bearing interest at an Index Rate (A) with respect to a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SIFMA Index Rate, on or prior to each Interest Payment Date, and (B) with respect to a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SOFR Index Rate, on each Interest Payment Date, which in the case of a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SOFR Index Rate shall be the SOFR Interest Calculation Date. The amount of interest due on a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SIFMA Index Rate on any Interest Payment Date shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the calendar month immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. The amount of interest due on a Series of Bonds bearing interest at the SOFR Index Rate on any Interest Payment Date shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the SOFR Accrual Period immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. All percentages resulting from any step in the calculation of interest on a Series of Bonds while in an Index Rate Period will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest ten thousandth of a percentage point (i.e., to five decimal places) with five hundred thousandths of a percentage point rounded upward, and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation of interest on such Bonds while in an Index Rate Period will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward).

(v) Upon the written request of any Bondholder, the Trustee shall (A) confirm the applicable Index Rate then in effect, and (B) provide the calculation of, and supporting data for, the amount of interest due on a Series of Bonds bearing interest at an Index Rate on each Interest Payment Date.

(vi) In determining the Index Rate that any Bond shall bear as provided in this Section 2.9, neither the Underwriter nor the Remarketing Agent, as applicable, the Calculation Agent, nor the Trustee shall have any liability to the Issuer or the Holder of such Bond, except for its negligence or willful misconduct.

(vii) If, during any Index Rate Period, the Index or rate used to determine an Index Rate is not reported by the relevant source at the time necessary for determination of such Index Rate or otherwise ceases to be available, the Issuer or its independent financial advisor shall determine a substitute or replacement Index Rate (as applicable), including any Alternative Rate and any Adjustments, and promptly provide the same via Electronic Means to the Trustee and the Calculation Agent, together with the effective date of the substitute or replacement Index Rate.

which substitute or replacement must be consistent with any corresponding substitute or replacement index designated pursuant to the relevant Interest Rate Swap.

(c) Index Rate Continuation.

(i) On any Mandatory Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.13 or in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture, and unless the Issuer has given written notice with respect to the Conversion of the Bonds to an Interest Rate Period other than the Index Rate Period, the Issuer may establish a new Index Rate Period and a new Index Rate for the Bonds with such right to be exercised by delivery of an Index Rate Continuation Notice to the Trustee no less than 30 days prior to the effective date of the new Index Rate Period. The Index Rate Continuation Notice shall be accompanied by a letter or letters of Bond Counsel and/or Special Tax Counsel to the effect that it expects to be able to deliver a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel on the effective date of the new Index Rate Period.

(ii) Any establishment of a new Index Rate and Index Rate Period for a Series of Bonds pursuant to paragraph (i) above must comply with the following conditions:

(A) the first day of such new Index Rate Period must be a Mandatory Purchase Date for such Bonds pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.13, and such Bonds shall be required to be tendered for purchase on such date;

(C) no new Index Rate shall become effective unless (x) the Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel referred to in paragraph (i) above is delivered on the first day of the new Index Rate Period and (y) no Failed Remarketing has occurred.

(iii) Upon receipt by the Trustee of an Index Rate Continuation Notice from an Authorized Officer of the Issuer, as soon as practicable, but in any event not less than 10 Business Days prior to the first day of the proposed Index Rate Period, the Issuer (or any Dissemination Agent appointed by the Issuer) shall give notice by first-class mail or by Electronic Means via EMMA to the Holders of the Bonds of the applicable Series, which notice shall state in substance:

(A) that a new Index Rate Period and Index Rate is to be established for such Bonds and the proposed effective date of such new Index Rate Period (which date shall be the Mandatory Purchase Date for such Bonds pursuant to Section 4.13), and that such new Index Rate Period and Index Rate will become effective on such date if the conditions specified in this Section 2.9 are satisfied on or before such date;

40118-2  
<!-- Page 70 -->
(B) that all Bonds of the applicable Series are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the applicable Mandatory Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.13 (whether or not the proposed new Index Rate Period becomes effective on such date) at the Purchase Price, which shall be specified therein;

(C) the first day of the new Index Rate Period;

(D) that the new Index Rate Period and Index Rate for the Bonds shall not be established unless a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel is delivered to the Trustee on the first day of the new Index Rate Period and no Failed Remarketing has occurred;

(E) the CUSIP numbers or other identification information of the applicable Series; and

(F) that, to the extent that there shall be on deposit with the Trustee on the first day of the new Index Rate Period an amount of money sufficient to pay the Purchase Price thereof, all the Bonds not delivered to the Trustee on or prior to such date shall be deemed to have been properly tendered for purchase and shall cease to constitute or represent a right on behalf of the Holder thereof to payment of principal thereof or interest thereon and shall represent and constitute only the right to payment of the Purchase Price on deposit with the Trustee, without interest accruing thereon after such date.

(d) End of Index Rate Period. In the event the Issuer has not given an Index Rate Continuation Notice or other Written Notice reasonably acceptable to the Trustee with respect to the Conversion of Bonds to an Interest Rate Period other than an Index Rate Period, in either case at the time required by this Indenture, or if the conditions to the effectiveness of a new Index Rate Period and new Index Rate set forth in Section 2.9(c)(ii) are not satisfied, including as a result of the Remarketing Agent’s failure to establish an Index Rate as herein provided, then the Bonds of the applicable Series shall be purchased on the applicable Mandatory Purchase Date pursuant to Section 4.13 and the Bonds shall not be remarketed.

Section 2.10 Notice of Conversion. (a) In the event that the Issuer shall elect to convert the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to a Daily Interest Rate Period, a Weekly Interest Rate Period, a Fixed Rate Period, an Index Rate Period or a Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period as provided in this Article II, then the Written Direction of the Issuer required to be delivered to the Trustee by the applicable provision of this Article II shall be given by registered or certified mail, or by Electronic Means.

and the Bonds of the applicable Series shall continue to bear interest in the Daily Interest Rate Period, Weekly Interest Rate Period, Fixed Rate Period, Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period or Index Rate Period, as the case may be, as in effect immediately prior to such proposed Conversion (provided, that the period of any such continuing Fixed Rate Period shall be one year). In any event, if notice of a Conversion has been mailed to the Owners as provided in this Article II and the Issuer rescinds its election to make such Conversion, then the Bonds of the applicable Series shall continue to be subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the date which would have been the Conversion Date as provided in Section 4.14.

(c) No Conversion of a Series of Bonds from one Interest Rate Period to another shall take effect under this Indenture unless each of the following conditions, to the extent applicable, shall have been satisfied:

(i) the Trustee shall have received a Favorable Opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to such Conversion;

(ii) with respect to any Series of Bonds bearing interest at an Index Rate or a Fixed Rate, no Conversion may occur with respect to such Bonds earlier than (A) the Business Day following the last day of the applicable Interest Rate Period or (B) in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds, a day on which such Bonds are subject to optional redemption pursuant to Section 4.3(b) or an applicable Supplemental Indenture;

(iv) in the case of a Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds to an Index Rate Period, prior to the Conversion Date the Issuer shall have appointed a Calculation Agent and executed and delivered a Calculation Agent Agreement with respect to such Series of Bonds.

(d) If any condition to the Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds shall not have been satisfied, then the Interest Rate Period shall not be converted and the Bonds of the applicable Series shall continue in the Daily Interest Rate Period, Weekly Interest Rate Period, Fixed Rate Period, or Commercial Paper Interest Rate Period, as the case may be, as in effect immediately prior to such proposed Conversion (provided, that the period of any such continuing Fixed Rate Period shall be one year), and the Bonds of such Series shall continue to be subject to mandatory tender for purchase on the date which would have been the effective date of the Conversion as provided in Section 4.14.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Article II to the contrary, in connection with the Conversion of the Interest Rate Period for a Series of Bonds from a Fixed Rate Period that would require the mandatory tender for purchase of such Bonds at a Purchase Price greater than the principal amount thereof, the Issuer, as a condition to exercising its option to cause a Conversion

**Section 2.12 Provisions Regarding the Issuer Commodity Swap.** (a) In connection with the Commodity Project, the Issuer shall enter into the initial Issuer Commodity Swap with the Commodity Swap Counterparty. The following shall apply to the Commodity Swaps:

(b) The following shall apply with respect to restrictions on replacement and termination of the Issuer Commodity Swap:  

(i) The Issuer agrees that it will not exercise any right to declare an early termination date under an Issuer Commodity Swap unless either (A) the Issuer has entered into a replacement Issuer Commodity Swap in accordance with clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) below, and such replacement Issuer Commodity Swap will be effective as of such early termination date and cover price exposure from and after such early termination date, or (B) a “Commodity Delivery Termination Date” has occurred or has been designated under (and as such term is defined in) the Commodity Purchase Agreement prior to or as of such early termination date.  

(ii) The Issuer may replace an Issuer Commodity Swap (and any related guaranty of a Commodity Swap Counterparty’s obligations thereunder) with a similar agreement for the same hedging purposes with an alternate Commodity Swap Counterparty at any time upon delivery to the Trustee of a Rating Confirmation.

(iv) If an Issuer Commodity Swap is not otherwise replaced but the Commodity Supplier is obligated under Section 3(d) of a Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement to continue paying Commodity Swap Receipts in the same amount that would have applied under such Issuer Commodity Swap, then such Issuer Commodity Swap will be deemed to be replaced by such obligation under such Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement and such obligation under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement will be treated as the Issuer Commodity Swap thereafter until such terminated Issuer Commodity Swap is otherwise replaced by another Issuer Commodity Swap.

(c) The following shall apply with respect to the termination of the Issuer Commodity Swap:

(i) Upon the occurrence of a Commodity Swap Replacement Event (defined below), the Issuer shall (A) notify the Commodity Supplier of such event pursuant to Section 17.5(b) of the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and (B) in accordance with Section 17.5(c) of the Commodity Purchase Agreement, either (I) replace the affected Issuer Commodity Swap by exercising its right to increase its notional quantities under the Issuer Commodity Swap with another Commodity Swap Counterparty if such a Commodity Swap is in effect and is not subject to termination, and otherwise (II) use its good faith efforts to replace such Issuer Commodity Swap with an alternate Issuer Commodity Swap during the swap replacement period set forth in Section 17.5(d) of the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

Section 3.5 Regulations with Respect to Exchanges and Registration of Transfers.

Prior to every such exchange or registration of transfer of Bonds, whether temporary or definitive, the Issuer or the Bond Registrar may require the Holder to pay an amount sufficient to reimburse it for any tax, fee or other governmental charge required to be paid with respect to such exchange or transfer. Unless otherwise provided in a Supplemental Indenture, neither the Issuer nor the Bond Registrar shall be required (a) to register the transfer or exchange of Bonds for the period next preceding any Interest Payment Date for the Bonds, beginning with the Regular Record Date for such Interest Payment Date and ending on such Interest Payment Date, or for the period next preceding any date for the proposed payment of Defaulted Interest with respect to such Bonds beginning with the Special Record Date for the date of such proposed payment and ending on the date of such proposed payment, (b) to register the transfer or exchange of Bonds for a period beginning 15 days before the mailing of any notice of redemption of such Bonds and ending on the day of such mailing, or (c) to register the transfer or exchange of any Bonds called for redemption. Every Person that transfers Bonds shall timely provide or cause to be timely provided to the Trustee all information necessary to allow the Trustee to comply with any applicable tax reporting obligations, including without limitation any cost-basis reporting obligations under Section 6045 of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations promulgated thereunder.

Section 3.6 Bonds Mutilated, Destroyed, Stolen or Lost. If any Bond becomes mutilated or is lost, stolen or destroyed, the Issuer may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver a new Bond of like Series, date of issue, maturity date, principal amount and interest rate per annum as the Bond so mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, provided that (a) in the case of such mutilated Bond, such Bond is first surrendered to the Trustee, (b) in the case of any such lost, stolen or destroyed Bond, there is first furnished evidence of such loss, theft or destruction, in form satisfactory to the Trustee together with indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee while the Bonds are held in a Book-Entry System and to the Trustee and the Issuer at all other times, (c) all other reasonable requirements of the Issuer, set forth in a Written Instrument of the Issuer delivered to the Trustee are complied with, and (d) expenses in connection with such transaction are paid by the Holder. Any Bond surrendered for registration of transfer shall be cancelled. Any such new Bonds issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 in substitution for Bonds alleged to be destroyed, stolen or lost shall constitute original additional contractual obligations on the part of the Issuer, whether or not the Bonds so alleged to be destroyed, stolen or lost be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be equally secured by and entitled to equal and proportionate benefits with all other Bonds issued under this Indenture, in any moneys or securities held by the Issuer or any Fiduciary for the benefit of the Bondholders.

Section 3.7 Temporary Bonds.

Trustee shall authenticate and, without service charge to the Owner thereof (except a sum sufficient to cover any tax, fee or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto), deliver in exchange therefor, definitive Bonds of the same aggregate principal amount and maturity as the temporary Bonds surrendered. Until so exchanged, the temporary Bonds shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits and security as definitive Bonds authenticated and issued pursuant to this Indenture.

(b) All temporary Bonds surrendered in exchange either for another temporary Bond or Bonds or for a definitive Bond or Bonds shall be forthwith cancelled by the Trustee.

**Section 3.8 Payment of Interest on Bonds; Interest Rights Preserved.** Interest on any Bond which is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Bond is registered at the close of business on the date (hereinafter, the “Regular Record Date”) which is the 15th day of the calendar month next preceding such Interest Payment Date.

Any interest on any Bond which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (hereinafter, “Defaulted Interest”) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Person who was the registered owner on the relevant Regular Record Date; and such Defaulted Interest shall be paid by the Issuer to the Persons in whose names the Bonds are registered at the close of business on a date (hereinafter, the “Special Record Date”) for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner: the Issuer shall notify the Bond Registrar in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Bond and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Issuer shall deposit with the Paying Agent an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to and approved in writing by the Paying Agent for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Section 3.8 provided. Thereupon the Bond Registrar shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days or less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Bond Registrar of written notice of the proposed payment. The Bond Registrar shall promptly notify the Issuer of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Issuer, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Bondholder at his address as it appears upon the registry books, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.8, each Bond delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Bond shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Bond.

**Section 3.9 Book Entry System; Appointment of Securities Depository.** All Bonds shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, as Securities Depository, and held in the custody or for the account of the Securities Depository. A single certificate will be issued and delivered to the Securities Depository for each maturity of Bonds, and the Beneficial Owners will not receive physical delivery of Bond certificates except as provided in this Indenture.

long as the Securities Depository shall continue to serve as securities depository for the Bonds as provided herein, all transfers of Beneficial Ownership interests will be made by book-entry only, and no investor or other party purchasing, selling or otherwise transferring Beneficial Ownership of Bonds is to receive, hold or deliver any Bond certificate.

The Issuer may, with written notice to the Trustee but without the consent of any Bondholders, appoint a successor Securities Depository and enter into an agreement with the successor Securities Depository, to establish procedures with respect to a Book-Entry System for the Bonds not inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture. Any successor Securities Depository shall be a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The Issuer and the Trustee may rely conclusively upon (i) a certificate of the Securities Depository as to the identity of the Participants in the Book-Entry System with respect to the Bonds, and (ii) a certificate of any such Participant as to the identity of, and the respective principal amount of the Bonds beneficially owned by the Beneficial Owners.

Whenever, during the term of the Bonds, the Beneficial Ownership of any Series thereof is determined by a book-entry at the Securities Depository, the requirements in this Indenture of holding, delivering or transferring such Bonds shall be deemed modified to require the appropriate Person to meet the requirements of the Securities Depository as to registering or transferring the book-entry to produce the same effect. Any provision hereof permitting or requiring delivery of the Bonds shall, while such Bonds are in such Book-Entry System, be satisfied by the notation on the books of the Securities Depository in accordance with applicable state law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any security (including any transfers between or among Securities Depository Participants or Beneficial Owners) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.

Except as otherwise specifically provided herein with respect to the rights of Participants and Beneficial Owners, when a Book-Entry System is in effect, the Issuer and the Trustee may treat the Securities Depository (or its nominee) as the sole and exclusive owner of the Bonds registered in its name for the purposes of payment of the principal or purchase price of and interest on such Bonds or portion thereof to be redeemed or purchased, of giving any notice permitted or required to be given to the Bondholders under this Indenture and of voting, and neither the Issuer nor the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will have any responsibility or obligations to the Securities Depository, any Participant, any Beneficial Owner or any other Person which is not shown on the bond register, with respect to (a) the accuracy of any records maintained by the Securities Depository or any Participant; (b) the payment by the Securities Depository or by any Participant of any amount due to any Beneficial Owner in respect of the principal amount or redemption or purchase price of, or interest on, any Bonds; (c) the delivery of any notice by the Securities Depository or any Participant; (d) the selection of the Beneficial Owners to receive payment in the event of any partial redemption of Bonds;

The Issuer shall promptly notify the Trustee in writing of all such payments by it to such Paying Agents.

mandatory tender for purchase shall be purchased on the Mandatory Purchase Date unless (i) a Failed Remarketing shall have occurred prior to a Mandatory Purchase Date occurring at the end of any Interest Rate Period, in which case such Bonds shall be redeemed pursuant to Section 4.1 rather than purchased on such Mandatory Purchase Date, or (ii) such Bonds shall have otherwise been redeemed on or prior to, or are not Outstanding as of, such Mandatory Purchase Date; and (c) that in the event that any Owner of a Bond so subject to mandatory tender for purchase shall not surrender such Bond to the Trustee for purchase on such Mandatory Purchase Date, then such Bond shall be deemed to be an Undelivered Bond, and that no interest shall accrue thereon on and after such Mandatory Purchase Date and that the Owner thereof shall have no rights under this Indenture other than to receive payment of the Purchase Price thereof. Any such notice of a mandatory tender of Bonds pursuant to Section 4.12, Section 4.13 or Section 4.14 shall be given no less than 30 days prior to the applicable Mandatory Purchase Date, and in addition, the Trustee shall give a conditional notice of extraordinary redemption pursuant to Section 4.4 no later than the applicable deadlines set forth in that Section to provide for the extraordinary redemption of the Bonds in the event that a Failed Remarketing occurs prior to the Mandatory Purchase Date. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which such conditional notice of extraordinary redemption is required to be given by the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.4, the Issuer shall direct the Trustee to send such conditional redemption notice pursuant to a Written Direction in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, which Written Direction shall include the applicable Redemption Date and method(s) for calculating the Redemption Price, to be followed by notice of the Redemption Price, as provided in Exhibit E.

Section 4.17 Irrevocable Notice Deemed to Be Tender of Bond; Undelivered Bonds. (a) The giving of notice by an Owner of a Bond bearing interest at a Daily Interest Rate or a Fixed Interest Rate pursuant to Section 4.11 shall constitute the irrevocable tender for purchase of each such Bond with respect to which such notice shall have been given, regardless of whether such Bond is delivered to the Trustee for purchase on the relevant Purchase Date as provided in this Article IV.

(b) The Trustee may refuse to accept delivery of any Purchased Bonds for which a proper instrument of transfer, with a satisfactory guaranty of signature, has not been provided; such refusal, however, shall not affect the validity of the purchase of such Bond as herein described. For purposes of this Article IV, the Trustee for the Bonds shall determine timely and proper delivery of Purchased Bonds and the proper endorsement of such Bonds. Such determination shall be binding on the Owners of such Bonds, the Issuer and the Remarketing Agent, absent manifest error. If any Owner of a Bond who shall have given notice of tender of purchase pursuant to Section 4.11 or any Owner of a Bond subject to mandatory tender for purchase pursuant to Section 4.12, Section 4.13 or Section 4.14 shall fail to deliver such Bond to the Trustee at the place and on the applicable date and at the time specified, or shall fail to deliver such Bond properly endorsed, such Bond shall constitute an Undelivered Bond. If funds in the amount of the Purchase Price of the Undelivered Bond are available for payment to the Owner thereof on the date and at the time specified, from and after the date and time of that required delivery, (i) the Undelivered Bond shall be deemed to be purchased and shall no longer be deemed to be Outstanding under this Indenture; (ii) interest shall no longer accrue thereon; and (iii) funds in the amount of the Purchase Price of the Undelivered Bond shall be held by the Trustee for such Bond for the benefit of the Owner thereof, to be paid on delivery (and proper endorsement) of the Undelivered Bond to the

# ARTICLE VII

## PARTICULAR COVENANTS OF the ISSUER

The Issuer covenants and agrees with the Trustee and the Bondholders as follows:

### Section 7.1 Payment of Bonds.
The Issuer shall duly and punctually pay or cause to be paid, but solely from the Trust Estate, the principal or Redemption Price, if any, of every Bond and the interest thereon, at the dates and places and in the manner provided in the Bonds, according to the true intent and meaning thereof.

### Section 7.2 Extension of Payment of Bonds.
The Issuer shall not directly or indirectly extend or assent to the extension of the maturity of any of the Bonds or the time of payment of any claims for interest by the purchase or funding of such Bonds or claims for interest or by any other arrangement, and in case the maturity of any of the Bonds or the time for payment of any such claims for interest shall be extended, such Bonds or claims for interest shall not be entitled, in case of any default under this Indenture, to the benefit of this Indenture or to any payment out of Revenues or Funds established by this Indenture, including the investment income, if any, thereof, pledged under this Indenture or the moneys (except moneys held in trust for the payment of particular Bonds or claims for interest pursuant to this Indenture) held by the Fiduciaries, except subject to the prior payment of the principal of all Bonds Outstanding the maturity of which has not been extended and such portion of the accrued interest on the Bonds as shall not be represented by such extended claims for interest.

### Section 7.3 Offices for Servicing Bonds.
The Issuer shall at all times maintain one or more agencies where Bonds may be presented for payment. Pursuant to Section 2.2, the Issuer has appointed the Trustee as Bond Registrar and Paying Agent for the Bonds and the Trustee hereby accepts such appointments. The Trustee shall at all times maintain one or more agencies or offices where Bonds may be presented for registration, exchange or transfer, where principal and Redemption Price of and interest on the Bonds may be paid, where reports, statements and other documents furnished to the Trustee hereunder may be inspected and where notices, demands and other documents may be served upon the Issuer in respect of the Bonds or of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall continuously maintain or make arrangements to provide such services.

### Section 7.4 Further Assurance.
At any and all times the Issuer shall, as far as it may be authorized by law, comply with any reasonable request of the Trustee to pass, make, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all and every such further resolutions, acts, deeds, conveyances, assignments, transfers and assurances as may be necessary or desirable for the better assuring, conveying, granting, assigning and confirming all and singular the rights, Revenues and other moneys, securities and funds hereby pledged, or intended so to be, or which the Issuer may become bound to pledge.

### Section 7.5 Power to Issue Bonds and Pledge the Trust Estate.
The Issuer is duly authorized under all applicable laws to create and issue the Bonds and to execute and deliver this Indenture and to pledge the Trust Estate, in the manner and to the extent provided in this Indenture. Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Indenture, the Trust Estate will be free and clear of

any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance thereon or with respect thereto prior to, or of equal rank with, the security interest, the pledge and assignment created by this Indenture, and all action on the part of the Issuer to that end has been and will be duly and validly taken. The Bonds and the provisions of this Indenture are and will be the valid and legally enforceable special obligations of the Issuer in accordance with their terms and the terms of this Indenture. The Issuer shall at all times, to the extent permitted by law, defend, preserve and protect the pledge of the Revenues and other moneys, securities and funds pledged under this Indenture and all the rights of the Bondholders under this Indenture against all claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever.

Section 7.6 Power To Enter Into and Perform the Commodity Supply Contract. The Issuer has and will have as long as any Bonds are Outstanding, good right and lawful power to (a) enter into the Commodity Supply Contract, (b) observe and perform its obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract, and (c) charge and collect the amounts payable by the Project Participant in respect of the gas supply or electricity supply and other services provided by the Issuer thereunder.

The Issuer has, and, to the extent permitted by law, will have as long as any Bonds are Outstanding, good right and lawful power to fix, establish, maintain and collect fees and charges for the sale and transportation or transmission of natural gas or electricity or otherwise with respect to the Commodity Project, subject to the terms of the Commodity Supply Contract.

Section 7.7 Creation of Liens. Unless the Trustee receives a Rating Confirmation, the Issuer shall not issue any bonds, notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness of similar nature, other than the Bonds, payable out of or secured by a security interest in or pledge or assignment of the Trust Estate and shall not create or cause to be created any lien or charge on the Trust Estate, provided, however, that nothing contained in this Indenture shall prevent the Issuer from entering into or issuing, if and to the extent permitted by law, (a) evidence of indebtedness provided this Indenture is discharged and satisfied as provided in Section 12.1, or (b) the Issuer Commodity Swap and Interest Rate Swaps upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. Nothing in this Indenture limits the Issuer’s right to issue any bonds, notes, debentures or other evidences of indebtedness of similar nature payable out of or secured by a security interest in or pledge or assignment of a trust estate separate from the Trust Estate.

Section 7.8 Limitations on Operating Expenses and Other Costs. The Issuer shall not incur Operating Expenses in any Fiscal Year in excess of the reasonable and necessary amount of such Operating Expenses. The Issuer shall not budget or incur Operating Expenses that would cause the Revenues available for Scheduled Debt Service Deposits pursuant to Section 5.5(a)(ii) to be insufficient for such purpose.

Section 7.9 Fees and Charges. The Issuer shall at all times fix, establish, maintain and collect (or cause to be collected) fees and charges, as and to the extent permitted under the provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract, for the sale and transportation or transmission of natural gas or electricity or otherwise with respect to the Commodity Project which shall be sufficient to provide Revenues in each Fiscal Year which, together with the other amounts available therefor, shall be equal to the sum of:

The Issuer shall enforce the provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract, as well as any other contract or contracts entered into relating to the Commodity Project, and duly perform its covenants and agreements thereunder.  

(b) In the event that the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed to the Issuer under the Commodity Supply Contract, the Issuer shall promptly exercise its right to suspend all gas and electricity deliveries to the Project Participant, and shall promptly give notice to the Commodity Supplier to follow the provisions set forth in the Commodity Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement for each Month of such suspension with respect to the quantities of natural gas or electricity for which deliveries have been suspended.  

(c) In the event that the Project Participant delivers a Call Option Notice (as defined in the Commodity Supply Contract) electing to have its contract quantity of natural gas or electricity remarketed for the duration of any Reset Period (as defined in the Commodity Supply Contract), then the Issuer will promptly give notice to the Commodity Supplier to follow the provisions set forth in the Commodity Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement for each Month of such Reset Period with respect to any quantities of natural gas or electricity that would otherwise have been delivered to the Project Participant.  

(d) The Issuer will not consent or agree to or permit any termination, rescission, amendment, assignment or novation of, or otherwise take any action under or in connection with, the Commodity Supply Contract that will impair its ability to comply during the current or any future year with the provisions of Section 7.9; provided that:  

(i) The Issuer may take any other action under or in connection with the Commodity Supply Contract that is expressly permitted pursuant to the provisions thereof;  

(ii) The Issuer and the Project Participant may amend the Commodity Supply Contract to change any delivery point;  

- 85 -  
4147-6340-3086.5  
4011-8-2  
<!-- Page 113 -->
(iii) the Commodity Supply Contract may be amended upon receipt of (A) a Rating Confirmation with respect to such amendment, and (B) to the extent such amendment would have a material effect (including a change in the timing of payments, the source of such payments, or the Issuer’s rights of collection thereof) upon the Receivables Purchase Provisions or the Issuer Commodity Swap, the consent of the Commodity Supplier or the Commodity Swap Counterparty, respectively; and

(iv) The Issuer may agree to an assignment or novation of all or a portion of the Project Participant’s rights and obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract upon (A) compliance with the restrictions on assignment set forth therein, (B) receipt of a Rating Confirmation with respect to such assignment or novation, and (C) provision of notice of such assignment or novation to the Commodity Swap Counterparty.

(e) As of the date of this Indenture, the Commodity Supply Contract with the Project Participant set forth on Schedule I shall be the only Commodity Supply Contract until such time, if any, that an assignment or novation occurs in accordance with the requirements set forth above.

(c) The Issuer will not consent or agree to or permit any assignment of, rescission of or amendment to or otherwise take any action under or in connection with the Commodity Purchase Agreement which will in any manner materially impair or materially adversely affect the rights of the Issuer thereunder or the rights or security of the Bondholders under this Indenture; provided that the Commodity Purchase Agreement may be assigned or amended without Bondholder consent upon receipt of a Rating Confirmation with respect to such assignment or amendment. Copies of the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and any amendments thereto, certified by an Authorized Officer, shall be filed with the Trustee.

(d) The Issuer has the right, pursuant to the Commodity Supplier LLCA to appoint a director (the “Issuer-Appointed Director”) to the board of directors of the Commodity Supplier.

Notwithstanding this grant of agency power, the Issuer shall retain, in the absence of any conflicting action by the Trustee, all of the Issuer’s obligations under the foregoing agreements and the right to exercise any rights for which it has appointed the Trustee as its agent in accordance with the foregoing; provided however, if an Event of Default has occurred, the Trustee shall have the right to notify the Issuer to cease exercising such rights and, upon receipt of such notice with a copy provided to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, and the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Trustee shall have exclusive authority to exercise such rights, and to collect and apply all amounts payable thereunder, until such time as the Trustee issues a subsequent notice otherwise.

Section 7.17 Tax Covenants. (a) The Issuer covenants that it shall not take any action, or fail to take any action, or permit any action to be taken on its behalf or cause or permit any circumstance within its control to arise or continue, if any such action or inaction would adversely affect the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of the interest on any of the Bonds under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Issuer covenants that it will (i) comply with the instructions and requirements of the Tax Agreement and (ii) exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Bonds to be redeemed (A) in such amount as may be necessary to maintain the exclusion from federal gross income of interest on the Bonds and (B) in whole in the event that interest on the Bonds becomes includible in federal gross income. The Issuer further agrees to follow any directions provided by Special Tax Counsel with respect to any such redemption. The covenant in clause (i) above shall survive payment in full or defeasance of the Bonds.

(b) In the event that at any time the Issuer is of the opinion that for purposes of this Section 7.18 it is necessary or helpful to restrict or limit the yield on the investment of any moneys held by the Trustee under this Indenture, the Issuer shall so instruct the Trustee in writing as to the specific actions to be taken, and the Trustee shall take such action as specified in such instructions.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 7.18, if the Issuer shall provide to the Trustee an Opinion of Special Tax Counsel that any specified action required under this Section 7.18 is no longer required or that some further or different action is required to maintain the exclusion from federal income tax of interest on the Bonds, the Issuer and the Trustee may

conclusively rely on such opinion in complying with the requirements of this Section 7.18 and of the Tax Agreement, and the covenants hereunder shall be deemed to be modified to that extent.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture to the contrary, upon the Issuer’s failure to observe or refuse to comply with the above covenants, the Holders of the Bonds, or the Trustee acting on their behalf pursuant to their written request and direction, shall be entitled to the rights and remedies provided to Bondholders under this Indenture based upon the Issuer’s failure to observe, or refuse to comply with, the above covenants.

Section 8.2 Accounting and Examination of Records after Default. (a) The Issuer covenants that if an Event of Default shall have happened and shall not have been remedied, the books of record and accounts of the Issuer and all other records relating to the Commodity Project shall at all times during regular business hours be subject to the inspection and use of the Trustee and of its agents and attorneys.

(b) The Issuer covenants that if an Event of Default shall have happened and shall not have been remedied, the Issuer, upon demand of the Trustee, will account, as if it were the trustee of an express trust, for all Revenues and other moneys, securities and funds pledged or held under this Indenture for such period as shall be stated in such demand.

Section 8.3 Enforcement of Agreements; Application of Moneys after Default. (a) The Issuer covenants that, if an Event of Default shall have happened and shall not have been remedied, it shall upon the demand of the Trustee (i) take such additional actions on its part as shall be necessary to cause the Project Participant to make payments of all amounts due under the Commodity Supply Contract to the Trustee, (ii) take such additional actions on its part as shall be necessary to cause Commodity Swap Counterparty to make payment of all amounts due under the Issuer Commodity Swap directly to the Trustee, (iii) take such additional actions on its part as shall be necessary to cause any Interest Rate Swap Counterparty to make payment of all amounts due under the Interest Rate Swap directly to the Trustee, (iv) execute and deliver such additional instruments that may be necessary to establish or confirm its pledge and assignment to the Trustee of its rights and remedies afforded the Issuer under the Commodity Supply Contract, and (v) pay over or cause to be paid over to the Trustee any Revenues which have not been paid directly to the Trustee as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. In addition, the Issuer hereby irrevocably appoints the Trustee as its agent to issue notices (including notices to direct the remarketing of natural gas or electricity) and to take any other actions that the Issuer is required or permitted to take under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract, the Issuer Commodity Swap and any Interest Rate Swap. The Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract and the Issuer Commodity Swap may be amended at any time for changes in Delivery Points as provided therein, without the consent of the Bondholders, any parties other than those to the relevant agreement, and without the provisions of opinions or other process hereunder. In exercising this agency power, the Trustee shall have the authority to take any such actions as it deems necessary under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract,

and the Issuer Commodity Swap. Notwithstanding this grant of agency power, the Issuer shall retain, in the absence of any conflicting action by the Trustee, the right to exercise any rights for which it has appointed the Trustee as its agent in accordance with the foregoing; provided, however, if an Event of Default has occurred, the Trustee shall have the right to notify the Issuer to cease exercising such rights and, upon receipt of such notice with a copy provided to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, and the Commodity Swap Counterparty under the Issuer Commodity Swap, the Trustee shall have exclusive authority to exercise such rights until such time as the Trustee issues a subsequent notice otherwise.

(b) During the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee shall apply all moneys, securities, funds and Revenues received by the Trustee pursuant to this Article VIII as follows and in the following order, provided that (x) moneys held in the Debt Service Account shall not be used for purposes other than payment of the interest and principal or Redemption Price then due on the Bonds and the payment of Interest Rate Swap Payments then due under the Interest Rate Swap in accordance with clause (iii) of this subsection (b) and (y) moneys in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account shall be used first to pay any Commodity Swap Payments then due:

(i) Expenses of Fiduciaries – to the payment of the reasonable fees, charges, expenses and liabilities of the Fiduciaries, including court costs and fees and expenses of their counsel;

(ii) Operating Expenses – to the payment of the amounts required for Operating Expenses and for the payment of such other amounts related to the Commodity Project as are necessary in the judgment of the Trustee to prevent loss of Revenues. For this purpose, the books of record and accounts of the Issuer relating to the Commodity Project shall at all times during regular business hours be subject to the inspection of the Trustee and its representatives and agents during the continuance of such Event of Default; and

(iii) Principal or Redemption Price and Interest – to the payment of the principal and interest then due and unpaid upon the Bonds and the Interest Rate Swap Payments then due under the Interest Rate Swap, without preference or priority of principal over interest, of any Bond over any other Bond, of any payment in respect of such principal or interest over any Interest Rate Swap Payment or of any Interest Rate Swap Payment over any payment in respect of such principal or interest, ratably, according to the amounts due respectively for principal and interest, to the Persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or preference except as to any difference in the respective rates of interest specified in the Bonds and the Interest Rate Swap.

When the Trustee incurs costs or expenses (including legal fees, costs and expenses) or renders services after the occurrence of an Event of Default, such costs and expenses and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, moratorium, reorganization or other debtor relief law.

(c) If and whenever all overdue installments of interest on all Bonds, together with the reasonable charges, expenses and liabilities of the Trustee, and all other sums payable or secured by the Issuer under this Indenture, including the principal and Redemption Price of and accrued unpaid interest on all Bonds which shall then be payable by declaration or otherwise, shall either be paid by or for the account of the Issuer, or provisions satisfactory to the Trustee shall be made for such payment, and all defaults under this Indenture or the Bonds shall be made good or secured to the satisfaction of the Trustee or provision deemed by the Trustee to be adequate shall be made therefor, the Trustee shall pay over to the Issuer all moneys, securities and funds then remaining unexpended in the hands of the Trustee (except moneys, securities and funds deposited or pledged, or required by the terms of this Indenture, particularly Section 5.2, to be deposited or pledged, with the Trustee), and thereupon the Issuer and the Trustee shall be restored, respectively, to their former positions and rights under this Indenture.

(b) All rights of action under this Indenture may be enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the Bonds or the production thereof at the trial or other proceedings, and any such suit or proceedings instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its name.

(c) The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Bonds at the time Outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, provided that the Trustee shall have the right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee shall be advised by counsel that the action or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken, or if the Trustee in good faith shall determine that the action or proceeding so directed would involve the Trustee in personal liability or be unjustly prejudicial to the Bondholders not parties to such direction.

(d) Upon commencing a suit in equity or upon other commencement of judicial proceedings by the Trustee to enforce any right under this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled - 95 -

to exercise any and all rights and powers conferred in this Indenture and provided to be exercised by the Trustee upon the occurrence of any Event of Default.

(e) Regardless of the happening of an Event of Default, the Trustee shall have power to, but unless requested in writing by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding and furnished with reasonable security and indemnity, shall be under no obligation to, institute and maintain such suits and proceedings as it may be advised shall be necessary or expedient to prevent any impairment of the security under this Indenture by any acts which may be unlawful or in violation of this Indenture, and such suits and proceedings as the Trustee may be advised shall be necessary or expedient to preserve or protect its interests and the interests of the Bondholders.

Section 8.6 Restriction on Bondholder’s Action. (a) No Holder of any Bond shall have any right to institute any suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity for the enforcement of any provision of this Indenture or the execution of any trust under this Indenture or for any remedy under this Indenture, unless such Holder (i) shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of the happening of an Event of Default, as provided in this Article VIII, and the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding shall have filed a written request with the Trustee, (ii) shall have offered it reasonable opportunity, either to exercise the powers granted in this Indenture or by the Act or by the laws of the State or to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name, and (iii) shall have offered to the Trustee adequate security and indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee shall have refused to comply with such request for a period of 60 days after receipt by it of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, it being understood and intended that no one or more Holders of Bonds shall have any right in any manner whatever by its or their action to affect, disturb or prejudice the pledge created by this Indenture, or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner therein provided; and that all proceedings at law or in equity to enforce any provision of this Indenture shall be instituted, had and maintained in the manner provided in this Indenture and for the equal benefit of all Holders of the Outstanding Bonds, subject only to the provisions of Section 7.2.

**Section 9.4 Evidence on Which Fiduciaries May Act.**  
(a) Each Fiduciary, upon receipt of any notice, direction, resolution, request, consent, order, certificate, report, opinion, bond or other paper or document furnished to it pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, shall examine such instrument to determine whether it conforms to the requirements of this Indenture and shall be protected in acting upon any such instrument believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. Each Fiduciary may consult with any consultant, accountant, or counsel, who may or may not be counsel to the Issuer, and the opinion of such consultant, accountant, or counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered by it under this Indenture in good faith and in accordance therewith and the Trustee shall be under no duty to make any investigation or inquiry into any statements contained or matters referred to in any such instrument.

(b) Whenever any Fiduciary shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking or suffering any action under this Indenture, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be therein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a Written Certificate of the Issuer, and such certificate shall be full warrant for any action taken or suffered in good faith under the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof; but in its discretion the Fiduciary may in lieu thereof accept other evidence of such fact or matter or may require such further or additional evidence as it may deem reasonable. Neither the Trustee, the Bond Registrar nor the Paying Agent shall be bound to recognize any Person as a Bondholder or to take any action at its request unless its Bond shall be deposited with such entity or satisfactory evidence of the ownership of such Bond shall be furnished to such entity.

(c) The Trustee shall have the right to accept and act upon directions given pursuant to this Indenture, or any other document reasonably relating to the Bonds and delivered using Electronic Means; provided, however, that the Issuer shall provide to the Trustee a Written Certificate of the Issuer listing Authorized Officers with the authority to provide such directions and containing specimen signatures of such Authorized Officers, which Written Certificate of the Issuer shall be amended whenever a person is to be added or deleted from the listing. If the Issuer elects to give the Trustee directions using Electronic Means and the Trustee in its discretion elects to act upon such directions, the Trustee’s understanding of such directions shall be deemed controlling. The Issuer understands and agrees that the Trustee cannot determine the identity of the actual sender of such directions and that the Trustee shall conclusively presume that directions that purport to have been sent by an Authorized Officer listed on the Written Certificate of the Issuer provided to the Trustee have been sent by such Authorized Officer. The Issuer shall be responsible for ensuring that only Authorized Officers transmit such directions to the Trustee and that all Authorized Officers treat applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys as confidential and with extreme care. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Trustee’s reliance upon and compliance with such directions notwithstanding such directions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written direction. The Issuer agrees: (i) to assume all risks arising out of the use of Electronic Means to submit directions to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the

40118-2  
<!-- Page 127 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
Trustee acting on unauthorized directions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties; (ii) that it is fully informed of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of transmitting directions to the Trustee and that there may be more secure methods of transmitting directions, (iii) that the security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its transmission of directions provide to it a commercially reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and circumstances and (iv) to notify the Trustee immediately upon learning of any compromise or unauthorized use of the security procedures.

(d) Paper copies or “printouts” of any document, if introduced as evidence in any judicial, arbitral, mediation or other administrative proceeding, will be admissible as between the Issuer and the Trustee to the same extent and under the same conditions as other original business records created and maintained in documentary form. Neither party shall contest the admissibility of true and accurate copies of Electronically Signed Documents on the basis of the best evidence rule or as not satisfying the business records exception to the hearsay rule.

Section 9.5 Compensation.

Section 9.10 Transfer of Rights and Property to Successor Trustee.

Any such successor Trustee shall promptly notify the Paying Agents of its appointment as Trustee.

Section 9.11 Merger or Consolidation. Any company into which any Fiduciary may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated or any company resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which it shall be a party or any company to which any Fiduciary may sell or transfer all or substantially all of its corporate trust business, provided such company shall be a bank with trust powers or trust company organized under the laws of any state of the United States or a national banking association and shall be authorized by law to perform all the duties imposed upon it by this Indenture and shall meet the qualifications set forth in Section 9.9(c), shall be the successor to such Fiduciary without the execution or filing of any paper or the performance of any further act.

Section 9.13 Resignation or Removal of Paying Agent and Appointment of Successor. (a) Any Paying Agent may at any time resign and be discharged of the duties and obligations created by this Indenture by giving at least 45 days’ written notice to the Issuer, the Trustee and the other Paying Agents.

(b) In the event of the resignation or removal of any Paying Agent, such Paying Agent shall pay over, assign and deliver any moneys held by it as Paying Agent to its successor, or if there be no successor, to the Trustee. In the event that for any reason there shall be a vacancy in the office of any Paying Agent, the Trustee shall act as such Paying Agent.

No such modification or amendment shall permit a change in the terms of redemption or maturity of the principal of any Outstanding Bond or of any installment of interest thereon or a reduction in the principal amount or the Redemption Price thereof or in the rate of interest thereon without the consent of the Holder of such Bond, or shall reduce the percentages or otherwise affect the classes of Bonds the consent of the Holders of which is required to effect any such modification or amendment, or shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of any Fiduciary without its written assent thereto. For the purposes of this Section 11.2, the Bonds shall be deemed to be affected by a modification or amendment of this Indenture if the same adversely affects or diminishes the rights of the Holders of Bonds in any material respect.

Otherwise, each such consent shall be effective only if accompanied by proof of the holding, at the date of such consent, of the Bonds with respect to which such consent is given, which proof shall be as permitted by Section 12.2. A certificate or certificates executed by the Trustee and filed with the Trustee and the Issuer stating that it has examined such proof and that such proof is sufficient in accordance with Section 12.2 shall be conclusive that the consents have been given by the Holders of the Bonds described in such certificate or certificates of the Trustee. Any such consent shall be irrevocable and shall be binding upon the Holder of the Bonds giving such consent and, anything in Section 12.2 to the contrary notwithstanding, upon any subsequent Holder of such Bonds and of any Bonds issued in exchange therefor (whether or not such subsequent Holder thereof has notice of such consent). At any time after the Holders of the required percentages of Bonds shall have filed their consents to the Supplemental Indenture (or have deemed to have consented to such Supplemental Indenture), the Trustee shall make and file with the Trustee and the Issuer a written statement that the Holders of such required percentages of Bonds have consented to, such Supplemental Indenture. Such written statements shall be conclusive that such consents have been received.

A record, consisting of the certificates or statements required or permitted by this Section 11.3 to be made by the Trustee, shall be proof of the matters therein stated.

Section 11.4 Notifications by Unanimous Consent. The terms and provisions of this Indenture and the rights and obligations of the Issuer and of the Holders of the Bonds thereunder may be modified or amended in any respect upon the execution of a Supplemental Indenture by the Trustee and the Issuer, the consent of the Holders of all of the Bonds then Outstanding (such consent to be given as provided in Section 11.3), and the consent of any Interest Rate Swap Counterparty if required by Section 11.2; provided, however, that no such modification or amendment shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of any Fiduciary or any of the provisions referenced in Section 10.3(e) without the filing with the Trustee of the written assent thereto of such Fiduciary or the Commodity Swap Counterparty, respectively, in addition to the consent of the Bondholders.

Section 11.6  Notation on Bonds.  Bonds authenticated and delivered after the effective date of any action taken as provided in Article X or this Article XI may, and, if the Trustee so determines, shall, bear a notation by endorsement or otherwise in form approved by the Issuer and the Trustee as to such action, and in that case upon demand of the Holder of any Bond Outstanding at such effective date and presentation of its Bond for the purpose at the principal corporate trust office of the Trustee or upon any transfer or exchange of any Bond Outstanding at such effective date, suitable notation shall be made on such Bond or upon any Bond issued upon any such transfer or exchange by the Trustee as to any such action.

If the Issuer shall pay or cause to be paid, or there shall otherwise be paid, to the Holders of any Outstanding Bonds the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due or to become due thereon, at the times and in the manner stipulated therein and in this Indenture, such Bonds shall cease to be entitled to any lien, benefit or security under this Indenture, and all covenants, agreements and obligations of the Issuer to the Holders of such Bonds shall thereupon cease, terminate and be discharged and satisfied except for remaining rights of registration of transfer and exchange of Bonds.

(b) Bonds or interest installments for the payment or redemption of which moneys shall have been set aside and shall be held in trust by the Paying Agents (through deposit by the Issuer of funds for such payment or redemption or otherwise) at the maturity or redemption date thereof shall be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in subsection (a). In addition, any Outstanding Bonds shall prior to the maturity or redemption date thereof be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in subsection (a) upon compliance with the provisions of subsection (c).

(c) Subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section 12.1, any Outstanding Bonds shall prior to the maturity or redemption date thereof be deemed to have been paid within the meaning and with the effect expressed in subsection (a) of this Section 12.1 if (i) in case any of said Bonds are to be redeemed on any date prior to maturity, the Issuer shall have given the Trustee irrevocable written instructions accepted in writing by the Trustee to mail as provided in Article IV notice of redemption of such Bonds (other than Bonds which have been purchased by the Trustee at the direction of the Issuer or purchased or otherwise acquired by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee as hereinafter provided prior to the mailing of such notice of redemption) on said date, (ii) there shall have been deposited with the Trustee either moneys (including moneys withdrawn and deposited pursuant to Section 5.7(g)) in an amount which shall be sufficient, or Defeasance Securities (including any Defeasance Securities issued or held in book-entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury of the United States) the principal of and the interest on which when due will provide moneys which, together with the moneys, if any, deposited with the Trustee at the same time, shall be sufficient, to pay when due the principal or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due and to become due on said Bonds (with such interest being calculated at the Maximum Rate with respect to any Bonds with interest rates that are not fixed to their redemption or maturity date, as applicable) on or prior to the redemption date or maturity date thereof, as the case may be, and (iii) in the event said Bonds are not by their terms subject to redemption within the next succeeding 60 days, the Issuer shall have given the Trustee in form satisfactory to it irrevocable written instructions to mail, as soon as practicable, a notice to the Holders of such Bonds at their last addresses appearing upon the registry books at the close of business on the last Business Day of the month preceding the month for which notice is mailed that the deposit required by (ii) above has been made with the Trustee and that said Bonds are deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 and stating such maturity or redemption date upon which moneys are expected, subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section 12.1, to be available for the payment of the principal or Redemption Price, if

applicable, on said Bonds (other than Bonds which have been purchased by the Trustee at the direction of the Issuer or purchased or otherwise acquired by the Issuer and delivered to the Trustee as hereinafter provided prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption referred to in clause (i)). Any notice of redemption mailed pursuant to the preceding sentence with respect to Bonds which constitute less than all of the Outstanding Bonds of any maturity shall specify the letter and number or other distinguishing mark of each such Bond. The Trustee shall, as and to the extent necessary, apply moneys held by it pursuant to this Section 12.1 to the retirement of said Bonds in amounts equal to the unsatisfied balances (determined as provided in Section 12.1) of any Sinking Fund Installments with respect to such Bonds, all in the manner provided in this Indenture. The Trustee shall, if so directed by the Issuer (A) prior to the maturity date of Bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 which are not to be redeemed prior to their maturity date or (B) prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption referred to in clause (i) above with respect to any Bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 which are to be redeemed on any date prior to their maturity, apply moneys deposited with the Trustee in respect of such Bonds and redeem or sell Defeasance Securities so deposited with the Trustee and apply the proceeds thereof to the purchase of such Bonds and, the Trustee shall immediately thereafter cancel all such Bonds so purchased; provided, however, that the moneys and Defeasance Securities remaining on deposit with the Trustee after the purchase and cancellation of such Bonds (or the deemed cancellation thereof) shall be sufficient to pay when due the Principal Installment or Redemption Price, if applicable, and interest due or to become due on all Bonds (calculated as described above), in respect of which such moneys and Defeasance Securities are being held by the Trustee on or prior to the redemption date or maturity date thereof, as the case may be. If, at any time (1) prior to the maturity date of Bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 which are not to be redeemed prior to their maturity date or (2) prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption referred to in clause (i) with respect to any Bonds deemed to have been paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 which are to be redeemed on any date prior to their maturity, the Trustee shall purchase or otherwise acquire any such Bonds and deliver such Bonds to the Trustee prior to their maturity date or redemption date, as the case may be, the Trustee shall immediately cancel all such Bonds so delivered; such delivery of Bonds to the Trustee shall be accompanied by directions from the Issuer to the Trustee as to the manner in which such Bonds are to be applied against the obligation of the Trustee to pay or redeem Bonds deemed paid in accordance with this Section 12.1. The directions given by the Issuer to the Trustee referred to in the preceding sentences shall also specify the portion, if any, of such Bonds so purchased or delivered and cancelled or deemed cancelled to be applied against the obligation of the Trustee to pay Bonds deemed paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 upon their maturity date or dates and the portion, if any, of such Bonds so purchased or delivered and cancelled or deemed cancelled to be applied against the obligation of the Trustee to redeem Bonds deemed paid in accordance with this Section 12.1 on any date or dates prior to their maturity. In the event that on any date as a result of any purchases, acquisitions and cancellations or deemed cancellations of Bonds as provided in this Section 12.1 the total amount of moneys and Defeasance Securities remaining on deposit with the Trustee under this Section 12.1 is in excess of the total amount which would have been required to be deposited with the Trustee on such date in respect of the remaining Bonds in order to satisfy clause (ii) of this subsection (c) of Section 12.1, the Trustee shall, if requested by the Issuer, pay the amount of such excess to the Issuer free and clear of any trust, lien, security interest, pledge or assignment securing said Bonds or otherwise existing under this Indenture. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this Section 12.1, neither Defeasance - 112 - 4147-6340-3086.5 40118-2

In connection with any such deposit of Defeasance Securities, or any determination of the sufficiency or remaining sufficiency thereof, for any of the purposes described in this Section 12.1, there shall be delivered to the Trustee, on which it shall be entitled to rely, a verification report of an independent certified public accountant, verification agent or similar expert to the effect that such Defeasance Securities, together with investment earnings thereon (and other available cash deposited with the Trustee at the same time for the applicable purpose), will be sufficient to pay when due as and payable the principal (or Redemption Price, if applicable), interest, and premium, if applicable, on the applicable Bonds to redemption or maturity, as applicable. (d) Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, any moneys held by a Fiduciary in trust for the payment and discharge of any of the Bonds which remain unclaimed for two years after the date when such Bonds have become due and payable, either at their stated maturity dates or by call for earlier redemption, if such moneys were held by the Fiduciary at such date, or for two years after the date of deposit of such moneys if deposited with the Fiduciary after the said date when such Bonds became due and payable, shall, at the Written Request of the Issuer, be repaid by the Fiduciary to the Issuer, as its absolute property and free from trust, and the Fiduciary shall thereupon be released and discharged with respect thereto and the Bondholders shall look only to the Issuer for the payment of such Bonds; provided, however, that before being required to make any such payment to the Issuer the Fiduciary shall, at the expense of the Issuer, cause to be published at least twice, at an interval of not less than seven days between publications, in the Authorized Newspaper, a notice that said moneys remain unclaimed and that, after a date named in said notice, which date shall be not less than 30 days after the date of the first publication of such notice, the balance of such moneys then unclaimed will be returned to the Issuer. Section 12.2 Evidence of Signatures of Bondholders and Ownership of Bonds. (a) Any request, consent, revocation of consent or other instrument which this Indenture may require or permit to be signed and executed by the Bondholders may be in one or more instruments of similar tenor, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 11.3, shall be signed or executed by such Bondholders in person or by their attorneys appointed in writing. Proof of (1) the execution of any such instrument, or of an instrument appointing any such attorney, or (2) the holding by any Person of the Bonds shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture (except as otherwise therein expressly provided) if made in the following manner, or in any other manner satisfactory - 113 - 4147-6340-3086.5 40118-2.

to the Trustee, which may nevertheless in its discretion require further or other proof in cases where it deems the same desirable:

(i) The fact and date of the execution by any Bondholder or its attorney of such instruments may be proved by a guarantee of the signature thereof by a bank or trust company or by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized to take acknowledgments of deeds, that the Person signing such request or other instrument acknowledged to him the execution thereof, or by an affidavit of a witness of such execution, duly sworn to before such notary public or other officer. Where such execution is by an officer of a corporation or association or a member of a partnership, on behalf of such corporation, association or partnership, such signature, guarantee, certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of its authority.

(ii) The amount of Bonds transferable by delivery held by any Person executing any instrument as a Bondholder, the date of holding such Bonds, and the numbers and other identification thereof, may be proved by a certificate, which need not be acknowledged or verified, in form satisfactory to the Trustee, executed by the Trustee or by a member of a financial firm or by an officer of a bank, trust company, insurance company, or financial corporation or other depository wherever situated, showing at the date therein mentioned that such Person exhibited to such member or officer or had on deposit with such depository the Bonds described in such certificate. Such certificate may be given by a member of a financial firm or by an officer of any bank, trust company, insurance company or financial corporation or depository with respect to Bonds owned by it, if acceptable to the Trustee. In addition to the foregoing provisions, the Trustee may from time to time make such reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable permitting other proof of holding of Bonds transferable by delivery.

(b) The ownership of Bonds registered other than to bearer and the amount, numbers and other identification, and date of holding the same shall be proved by the registry books.

(c) Any request or consent by the owner of any Bond shall bind all future owners of such Bond in respect of anything done or suffered to be done by the Issuer or any Fiduciary in accordance therewith.

Section 12.3 Moneys Held for Particular Bonds. The amounts held by any Fiduciary for the payment of the interest, principal or Redemption Price due on any date with respect to particular Bonds shall, on and after such date and pending such payment, be set aside on its books and held in trust by it for the Holders of the Bonds entitled thereto.

Section 12.4 Preservation and Inspection of Documents. All documents received by any Fiduciary under the provisions of this Indenture shall, at all times during regular business hours (upon reasonable prior written notice) be subject to the inspection of the Issuer, any other Fiduciary, and any Bondholder and their agents and their representatives, any of whom may make copies thereof, subject to such reasonable regulations as such Fiduciary may from time to time determine to be required by law.

**EXHIBIT D**

**DIRECTION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY TO OPTIONALLY REDEEM COMMODITY SUPPLY REVENUE REFUNDING BONDS, SERIES 2024**

To: Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the “Trustee”)

DIRECTION IS HEREBY GIVEN BY NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY (the “Issuer”) to the Trustee for the Issuer’s Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”) issued pursuant to the Amended and Restated Trust Indenture, dated as of __1__, 2024 between the Issuer and the Trustee (the “Indenture”), to call the Bonds for redemption on ____, (the “Redemption Date”) at a redemption price (the “Redemption Price”), calculated by a quotation agent selected by the Issuer, equal to [FOR REDEMPTIONS UNDER SECTION 4.3(a): the greater of (a) the Amortized Value of the Series 2024 Bonds as of the Redemption Date, plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date, or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining unpaid payments of principal and interest to be paid on the Series 2024 Bonds to be redeemed from and including the Redemption Date (not including any portion of the interest accrued and unpaid as of the redemption date) to the earlier of the stated maturity date of such Series 2024 Bonds or the Series 2024 Mandatory Purchase Date, discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis at a discount rate equal to the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate for such Bonds minus 0.25% per annum, plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date]; or [FOR REDEMPTIONS UNDER SECTION 4.3(b) the Amortized Value of the Series 2024 Bonds as of the Redemption Date, plus $0.__ per $1,000 of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date, provided that, if the optional redemption date is the Mandatory Purchase Date, the Redemption Price shall be the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption].

“Amortized Value” means, with respect to any Series 2024 Bond to be redeemed when a Fixed Rate Period is in effect with respect to such Bond, the principal amount of such Bond multiplied by the price of such Bond expressed as a percentage, calculated by a major market maker in municipal securities, as the quotation agent, selected by the Issuer, based on the industry standard method of calculating bond prices (as such industry standard prevails on the date of delivery of the Bonds), with a delivery date equal to the date of redemption, a maturity date equal to the earlier of (a) the stated maturity date of such Bond or (b) the Fixed Rate Tender Date of such Bond and a yield equal to such Bond’s original reoffering yield, which, in the case of the Series 2024 Bonds and certain dates, produces the amounts for all of the Series 2024 Bonds set forth in Schedule IV attached to the Indenture.

“Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate” means, for the Series 2024 Bonds of any maturity, the “Comparable AAA General Obligations” yield curve rate for the year of such maturity or Mandatory Purchase Date, as applicable, as published by Refinitiv Global Markets, Inc. one Business Day prior to the date of this Notice of Conditional Optional Redemption. If no such yield curve rate is established for the applicable year, the “Comparable AAA General Obligations” yield curve rate for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the applicable year shall be determined, and the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate will be

interpolated or extrapolated from those yield curve rates on a straight-line basis. This rate is made available daily by Refinitiv Global Markets, Inc. and is available to its subscribers through the internet address: www.tm3.com. In calculating the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate, should Refinitiv Global Markets, Inc. no longer publish the “Comparable AAA General Obligations” yield curve rate, then the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate shall equal the Consensus Scale yield curve rate for the applicable year. The Consensus Scale yield curve rate is made available daily by Municipal Market Analytics and is available to its subscribers through its internet address: www.mma-research.com. In the further event Municipal Market Analytics no longer publishes the Consensus Scale, the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate shall be determined by a major market maker in municipal securities, as the quotation agent, based upon the rate per annum equal to the annual yield to maturity, calculated using semi-annual compounding, of those tax-exempt general obligation bonds rated in the highest Rating Category by Moody’s and S&P with a maturity date equal to the stated maturity date or Mandatory Purchase Date, as applicable, of such Bonds having characteristics (other than the ratings) most comparable to those of such Bonds in the judgment of the quotation agent. The quotation agent’s determination of the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate shall be final and binding in the absence of manifest error on all parties and may be conclusively relied upon in good faith by the Trustee.

## TERMS OF ISSUER COMMODITY SWAP

For each Month beginning with [Month] 20__ and ending with [Month] 20__, the Issuer will determine for each “Primary Delivery Point” as set forth on Exhibit A to the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (i) the price under the “Monthly Index” (as set forth on such Exhibit A), (ii) the difference (which may be positive or negative) between such Monthly Index price and the fixed price set forth in the Issuer Commodity Swap, and (iii) the product of such difference and the Monthly gas and electricity quantity for such Primary Delivery Point as set forth on Exhibit A to the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

The Issuer will then calculate a net settlement amount for all Primary Delivery Points for such Month due by or to the Issuer under the Issuer Commodity Swap that aggregates the amounts determined under clause (iii) above.

All payments from the Issuer or the Commodity Swap Counterparty will be due on each “Payment Date” under the Issuer Commodity Swap (which shall be the 25th day of the Month following the Month of natural gas and electricity deliveries or, if such day is not a Business Day under the Issuer Commodity Swap, then the next following Business Day).

Period) with respect to any Shortfall Quantity, then Seller shall pay to Buyer the result determined by the following formula:

P = Q x (HP + AF)

Where:

P = The amount payable by Seller under this Section 4.1(b);

Q = The quantity of Replacement Gas or Replacement Electricity purchased;

HP = The higher of (i) the Replacement Gas Price or Replacement Electricity Price, as applicable or (ii) during the Gas Delivery Period, the Monthly Index Price applicable to the Gas Day and the Delivery Point for which the Shortfall Quantity arose, or (B) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Day-Ahead Market Price applicable to the Delivery Hour and the Delivery Point for which the Shortfall Quantity arose; provided that in the case of a Shortfall Quantity arising at a Secondary Electricity Delivery Point, “HP” shall be deemed to equal the Day-Ahead Market Price; and

AF = The Administrative Fee.

(c) If, with respect to any Shortfall Quantity, Replacement Gas or Replacement Electricity (as applicable) is not purchased, then Seller shall pay to Buyer the result determined by the following formula:

P = Q x IP

Where:

P = The amount payable by Seller under this Section 4.1(c);

Q = The portion of the Shortfall Quantity described in the lead-in to this Section 4.1(c); and

IP = Either (i) during the Gas Delivery Period, the Monthly Index Price applicable to the Gas Day and the Delivery Point for which the Shortfall Quantity arose, or (ii) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Day-Ahead Market Price applicable to the Delivery Hour and the Delivery Point for which the Shortfall Quantity arose.

(d) If, with respect to any Shortfall Quantity for Gas that arises on a Gas Day that commences on any of the last seven Business Days of a Month, Buyer or the Project Participant purchases Replacement Gas for delivery in the Month following the Month in which such Shortfall Quantity arose, then Seller shall pay to Buyer, in addition to those amounts already paid under Section 4.1(c), the positive result, if any, determined by the following formula:

18
<!-- Page 200 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

P = Q x ((RP + AF) - IP)

Where:

P = The amount payable by Seller under this Section 4.1(d);  
Q = The portion of the Shortfall Quantity described in the lead-in to this Section 4.1(d) above;  
RP = The Replacement Gas Price;  
AF = The Administrative Fee; and  
IP = The Monthly Index Price applicable to the Gas Day and Delivery Point for which the Shortfall Quantity arose.

(e) Buyer shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to monitor or cause Project Participant to monitor nominations and deliveries of Gas to be delivered directly from Seller to Buyer at each Delivery Point for each Gas Day and promptly notify Seller upon becoming aware that such nominations or deliveries might result in a Shortfall Quantity with respect to such Delivery Point. Buyer shall also exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to monitor or cause Project Participant to monitor any nominations and deliveries of Gas to be delivered directly from Seller to Project Participant at each Delivery Point for each Gas Day and promptly notify or cause Project Participant to promptly notify Seller if Buyer or Project Participant becomes aware that such nomination or deliveries would reasonably be expected to result in a Shortfall Quantity with respect to such Delivery Point.

(f) Buyer shall cause Project Participant to comply with its obligations under Section 4.1(d) of the Commodity Supply Contract to mitigate damages.

(g) Imbalance Charges shall not be recovered under this Section 4.1, but rather in accordance with Section 5.5.

Section 4.2 Buyer’s Failure to Take the Contract Quantity (Not Due to Force Majeure). Except to the extent Buyer is excused under Section 4.3, if, on any Gas Day during the Gas Delivery Period or for any Delivery Hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, Buyer breaches its obligation to take all or any portion of the Contract Quantity at any Delivery Point pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then Buyer shall be deemed to have issued a Deemed Remarketing Notice with respect to the portion not taken. Imbalance Charges shall not be recovered under this Section 4.2, but rather in accordance with Section 5.5. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to Gas required to be delivered on any Gas Day, Buyer may be deemed to have issued a Deemed Remarketing Notice with respect to the entire Contract Quantity unless Seller receives actual written notice from Buyer to the contrary prior to the end of the following Month or thirty (30) calendar days after Buyer first receives notice of a deficiency from the applicable Transporter, whichever is later.

Q = The quantity of Gas or Electricity described in the lead-in to this Section 4.3; and

IP = Either (i) during the Gas Delivery Period, the Monthly Index Price applicable to such Month and Delivery Point, or (ii) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Day-Ahead Market Price applicable to such Delivery Hour and Delivery Point.

**Section 4.4 Make-Up Gas Deliveries in Lieu of Payment.** The Parties may mutually agree, in lieu of payment pursuant to Section 4.1, Section 4.2 or Section 4.3, to make up all or any portion of the Contract Quantity of Gas not delivered or taken by increasing deliveries and takes over the remainder of the Month in which such failure occurred or in the following Month. If a Shortfall Quantity is made up in lieu of payment in accordance with the preceding sentence, Seller may apply such made up quantity against any balance of Shortfall Quantities, including against the most recent Shortfall Quantities.

**Section 4.5 Sole Remedies.** Except with respect to (a) the payment of Imbalance Charges pursuant to Section 5.5, (b) termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 17.4, and (c) the obligations of Seller under Section 8(c) of Exhibit C, the remedies set forth in this Article IV shall be each Party’s sole and exclusive remedies for any failure by the other Party to deliver or take Commodities, as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement.

# ARTICLE V: TRANSPORTATION AND DELIVERY; COMMUNICATIONS

## Section 5.1 Delivery Point.

(a) All Gas delivered under this Agreement shall be delivered and received (i) at the delivery point specified in Exhibit A (the “Primary Gas Delivery Point”), or (ii) to any other point (an “Alternate Gas Delivery Point”) that has been mutually agreed by Seller and Buyer (the Primary Gas Delivery Point or Alternate Gas Delivery Point, if specified, each being a “Gas Delivery Point”).

(b) The Daily Index Price, Index Price (Low) and Monthly Index Price for each Alternate Gas Delivery Point, as applicable, shall be the price mutually agreed and identified by the Parties, or if no such price is identified for such Alternate Gas Delivery Point, the price shall be the Daily Index Price, Index Price (Low) or Monthly Index Price for such Alternate Gas Delivery Point, as applicable, specified on Exhibit A for the Primary Gas Delivery Point from which quantities are being shifted to such Alternate Gas Delivery Point. The Parties shall (i) update Exhibit A upon any change to the terms thereof, including particularly as a result of any update to the Monthly Index Price to reflect a change in the Delivery Point Premium as defined in and established pursuant to the terms of the Commodity Supply Contract, and (ii) deliver a copy of such updated Exhibit A to the Swap Counterparty consistent with the terms of the Buyer Swap and the Seller Swap.

(c) All Electricity delivered under this Agreement shall be delivered (i) at the delivery point set forth in Exhibit A (the “Primary Electricity Delivery Point”), (ii) at one of the secondary delivery points set forth in Exhibit A with six (6) Months’ prior notice from Buyer (the “Secondary Electricity Delivery Points”), (iii) to any other point (an “Alternate Electricity Delivery Point”) that has been mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller or selected by Buyer pursuant to the following sentence or (iv) any applicable Assigned Delivery Point specified in an Assignment Schedule with respect to Assigned Electricity (the Primary Electricity Delivery Point, Secondary Electricity Delivery Point, Alternate Electricity Delivery Point or Assigned Delivery Point, if specified, each being an “Electricity Delivery Point”). Upon twelve (12) Months’ prior written notice to Seller, Buyer may select the California-Oregon Border (“COB”) as an Alternate Electricity Delivery Point provided that (A) Seller, within six (6) months after receiving such notice, confirms that it is able to obtain reliable Electricity supply for the Contract Quantity to be delivered hereunder at COB, (B) Seller may limit such period of deliveries at COB to three (3) years, without prejudice to Buyer’s ability to re-select COB as an Alternate Electricity Delivery Point in the future, and (C) Seller and Buyer are able to mutually agree upon the Day-Ahead Market Price and Real-Time Market Price that will apply for COB. Delivery of Electricity to Buyer at the Primary Electricity Delivery Point and the Secondary Electricity Delivery Points specified in Exhibit A shall be facilitated through submission of Inter-Scheduling Coordinator Trades (“ISTs”). The Project Participant shall designate a scheduling coordinator in the CAISO market for this purpose as specified in Exhibit G-2.

(d) The Day-Ahead Market Price and Real-Time Market Price for each Alternate Electricity Delivery Point, as applicable, shall be the price mutually agreed and identified by the Parties, or if no such price is identified for such Alternate Electricity Delivery Point, the
<!-- Page 203 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

price shall be the Day-Ahead Market Price and Real-Time Market Price for such Alternate Electricity Delivery Point, as applicable, specified on Exhibit A for the Primary Electricity Delivery Point from which quantities are being shifted to such Alternate Electricity Delivery Point.

## Section 5.2 Responsibility for Transportation; Permits.

(a) **Gas.**

(i) Seller shall obtain and pay for all processing, gathering, and transportation necessary for delivery of the Contract Quantity to each Delivery Point. Buyer shall obtain or cause to be obtained and pay for or cause payment to be made for all transportation necessary to receive the Contract Quantity at each Delivery Point and to transport the Contract Quantity from each Delivery Point.

(ii) Should either Party receive an operational flow order or other order or notice from a Transporter requiring action to be taken in connection with the Gas flowing under this Agreement (a “Critical Notice”), such Party shall notify or cause the notification of the other Party of the Critical Notice and provide or cause to be provided to the other Party a copy of same by electronic mail, or facsimile if requested, within a Commercially Reasonable timeframe. The Parties shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts required by the Critical Notice within the time prescribed by the applicable Transporter. Each Party shall, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 19.1, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from any Claims associated with any Critical Notice (i) of which the indemnifying Party failed to give the indemnified Party the notice required under this Agreement or (ii) under which the indemnifying Party failed to take the action required by the Critical Notice within the time prescribed, provided the notice from the indemnified Party was timely delivered.

(b) **Electricity.** Seller shall arrange and be responsible for transmission service of the Contract Quantity to the Delivery Point and shall Schedule or arrange for Scheduling services with its Transmission Providers, to deliver Electricity to the Delivery Point. Buyer shall arrange and be responsible for transmission service at and from the Delivery Point and shall Schedule or arrange for Scheduling services with its Transmission Providers to receive Electricity at the Delivery Point.

## Section 5.3 Title and Risk of Loss.

(a) Title to the Commodities delivered under this Agreement and risk of loss shall pass from Seller to Buyer at the Delivery Point; provided that the transfer of title and risk of loss for all Assigned Gas and Assigned Electricity shall be in accordance with the applicable Gas Assignment Agreement or PPA Assignment Agreement for any portion of the Contract Quantity for which an assignment agreement is in effect; provided further that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no indemnity obligations shall apply between the Parties with respect to any Assigned Product or Assigned Gas (as defined in a Gas Assignment Agreement).

(b) With respect to Gas, as between the Parties, Seller shall be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession of the Gas delivered under this Agreement, and responsible for any damage or injury caused thereby, prior to the time such Gas has been delivered to Buyer at the Delivery Point. 

22
<!-- Page 204 -->
![Delivery Point Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Delivery+Point+Agreement)

Delivery Point. After delivery of Gas to Buyer at the Delivery Point, Buyer shall be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession thereof and responsible for any injury or damage caused thereby. Each Party (each, an “Indemnifying Party”) assumes all liability for and, subject to the provisions of Section 19.1, shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party from any Claims, including death of Persons, arising from any act or incident occurring when title to Gas is vested in the Indemnifying Party.

Section 5.4 Daily Flow Rates. For Gas other than any portion of the Gas Contract Quantity for which a Gas Assignment Agreement is in effect, for which flow rates will be addressed in the applicable Gas Assignment Agreement, Seller shall nominate, schedule and deliver, and Buyer shall nominate, schedule and take, the Contract Quantity of Gas during the Gas Delivery Period at each Delivery Point in accordance with standard Firm service requirements of the Receiving Transporter and Delivering Transporter at such Delivery Point, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, neither Party in any case shall be obligated to incur additional costs by procuring additional services, running imbalances or taking any other actions to accommodate non-standard scheduling requirements of the other Party.

Section 5.5 Imbalances. The Parties shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to avoid the imposition of any Imbalance Charges. If Buyer or Seller receives an invoice from a Transporter that includes Imbalance Charges related to the obligations of either Party under this Agreement, the Parties shall determine the validity as well as the cause of such Imbalance Charges. If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of Buyer’s taking of quantities of Gas greater than or less than the Contract Quantity at any Delivery Point, then Buyer shall pay for such Imbalance Charges or reimburse Seller for such Imbalance Charges paid by Seller. If the Imbalance Charges were incurred as a result of Seller’s delivery of quantities of Gas greater than or less than the Contract Quantities at any Delivery Point, then Seller shall pay for such Imbalance Charges or reimburse Buyer for such Imbalance Charges paid by Buyer. Additionally, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5, Seller shall have no liability for Imbalance Charges in respect of any Gas required to be scheduled or delivered under an Upstream Supply Contract.

Section 5.6 Communications Protocol. Seller and Buyer shall comply with the communications protocols set forth in Exhibit G-1 for Gas deliveries and Exhibit G-2 for Electricity deliveries; provided that, for any portion of the Contract Quantity for which a Gas Assignment Agreement or a PPA Assignment Agreement is in effect, Scheduling shall be in accordance with the applicable assignment agreement.

Section 5.7 Gas Quality and Measurement. Buyer shall not be required to accept Gas delivered by Seller that does not meet the pressure, quality and heat content requirements of the Receiving Transporter as detailed in the applicable pipeline tariff. Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy against Seller with respect to any Gas that fails to meet such pressure, quality and heat content requirements shall be the right to reject non-conforming Gas and to receive payment under Article IV. If such rejected Gas meets the pressure, quality and heat content requirements of the Delivering Transporter, but does not meet such requirements of the Receiving Transporter, any such rejection by Buyer and failure to deliver by Seller shall be deemed to be excused by Force Majeure. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Article XI shall apply to any such event of Force Majeure. If such rejected Gas does not meet such requirements of either the Receiving

**Transporter or the Delivering Transporter, Seller shall be deemed to have failed to deliver any such Gas that is properly rejected. With respect to any measurement of Gas delivered or received under this Agreement at any Delivery Point, the measurement of such Gas (including the definition of Btu used in making such measurement) by the operator of such Delivery Point shall be deemed to be conclusive; provided, however, if the operator of such Delivery Point revises its measurement statements for Gas, such revision shall be effective as the measurement of Gas for the purposes of this Agreement and may be corrected pursuant to Section 14.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but without prejudice to any right of Project Participant to reject Assigned Gas under and as defined in an Upstream Supply Contract, measurement of Assigned Gas shall be as set forth in the applicable Upstream Supply Contract and Seller shall not have any liability for the failure of any Assigned Gas to meet any applicable quality requirements.**

**Section 5.8 Assigned Products. Neither Party shall have any liability under this Article V with respect to any portion of the Contract Quantity for which a Gas Assignment Agreement or a PPA Assignment Agreement is in effect.**

**ARTICLE VI. GAS ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT**

**Section 6.1 Upstream Supply Contract Assignments. The Project Participant may assign and J. Aron may agree to assume a portion of the Project Participant’s rights and obligations under an Upstream Supply Contract consistent with the terms set forth in Exhibit G-1.**

**Section 6.2 Adjustments to Contract Quantity. In connection with the execution of a Gas Assignment Agreement with an Assigned Contract Price (as defined in the relevant Gas Assignment Agreement) that is a fixed price, Seller shall revise Exhibit A to reflect appropriate adjustments to the Contract Quantity consistent with Section 8.3 of Exhibit G-1; provided such adjustments shall be reversed consistent with Section 8.3 of Exhibit G-1 following an early termination of the relevant Assignment Period.**

**ARTICLE VII. COMMODITY REMARKETING**

**Section 7.1 Commodity Remarketing. If the Project Participant is in default under its Commodity Supply Contract or does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Commodities purchased by Buyer under the Agreement as a result of (a) Project Participant’s decreased Gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period, (b) decreased demand by Project Participant’s retail customers or (c) a change in Law and requests that such Commodity be remarketed, then Buyer shall request (and pursuant to Section 4.2 may be deemed to request) remarketing services from Seller pursuant to the provisions of Exhibit C; provided that any remarketing request delivered under clause (c) above shall constitute a “Structural Remarketing Notice” and shall be subject to the following requirements:**

5 OHS NTD: Will this be defined (consistent with the Commodity Supply Agreement) in the Gas Communications Protocol? If not, add definition in Article 1. SM NTD: Thank you for clarifying. We have updated the definition in the Commodity Supply Contract to pick up Assignment Periods under Gas Assignment Agreements and PPA Assignment Agreements.

If Seller elects to remarket any Assigned Electricity, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to adjust the provisions of Exhibit C to reflect pricing, delivery and other terms related to such Assigned Electricity; provided that Seller shall have no obligation to remarket such Assigned Electricity unless and until Buyer and Seller have mutually agreed to such adjustments to Exhibit C

Section 7.2 Delegation of Authority. Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that Seller shall delegate its rights and obligations under Exhibit C to J. Aron pursuant to the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement subject to Section 11 of Exhibit C. Notwithstanding any such delegation, Seller shall remain liable to Buyer for the performance of all of Seller’s duties and obligations under this Agreement, including under Exhibit C.

**Section 12.1 Compliance with Laws.** This Agreement shall be subject to all present and future Laws of any Government Agency having jurisdiction, and neither Party has knowingly undertaken or will knowingly undertake or knowingly cause to be undertaken any activity that would conflict with such Laws; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed to restrict or limit either Party’s right to object to or contest any such Law, or its application to this Agreement or the transactions undertaken hereunder, and neither acquiescence therein or compliance therewith for any period of time shall be construed as a waiver of such right.

**Section 12.2 Contests.** Excluding all matters involving a contractual dispute between the Parties, no Party shall contest, cause to be contested or in any way actively support the contest of the equity, fairness, reasonableness or lawfulness of any terms or conditions set forth or established pursuant to this Agreement, as those terms or conditions may be at issue before any Government Agency in any proceeding, if the successful result of such contest would be to preclude or excuse the performance of this Agreement by either Party.

**Section 12.3 Defense of Agreement.** Excluding all matters involving a contractual dispute between the Parties, each Party shall hereafter defend and support this Agreement before any Government Agency in any proceeding, if the substance, validity or enforceability of all or any part of this Agreement is hereafter directly challenged or if any proposed changes in regulatory practices or procedures would have the effect of making this Agreement invalid or unenforceable or would subject either Party to any greater or different regulation or jurisdiction that materially affects the rights or obligations of the Parties under this Agreement.

**ARTICLE XIII.  
ASSIGNMENT**

Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party; provided, however, that:

(a) pursuant to the Bond Indenture, Buyer may, without the consent of Seller, transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this Agreement to the Trustee in connection with any financing or other financial arrangements; provided that Buyer shall not assign this Agreement unless, contemporaneously with the effectiveness of such assignment, Buyer also assigns the Buyer Swap (and the Buyer Swap Custodial Agreement) to the same assignee;

29
<!-- Page 211 -->
(b) upon written notice to Buyer, Seller may, without Buyer’s consent, assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of Seller, which assignment shall constitute a novation; provided that the assignee shall agree in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and Seller shall not assign this Agreement unless (i) Seller delivers a Rating Confirmation to Buyer with respect to such assignment, (ii) contemporaneously with the effectiveness of such assignment, Seller also assigns the Seller Swaps, the Seller Swap Custodial Agreements and the SPE Master Custodial Agreement to the same assignee and either (A) Seller assigns the Funding Agreement and Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to the same assignee or (B) the assignee provides to Buyer a guarantee of its obligations by GSG (as defined in the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement) and GSG continues to guarantee the obligations of J. Aron (or any successor to or assignee of J. Aron) under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, and (iii) the assignee is a special purpose entity approved by Buyer or its obligations under this Agreement are guaranteed by a Funding Recipient to the satisfaction of Buyer; and

(c) if (i) Seller notifies Buyer that the Funding Agreement will not be replaced, refinanced, or re-priced as of the end of any Interest Rate Period, (ii) Seller is unable to provide, under the Re-Pricing Agreement, an estimated Available Discount Percentage (as defined in the Re-Pricing Agreement) that is equal to or greater than the highest Minimum Discount Percentage under the Commodity Supply Contract, or (iii) if Buyer can provide reasonable evidence that the Seller’s estimated Reset Period Implied Rate (as defined in the Re-Pricing Agreement) is materially less than the Seller would offer to a substantially similar counterparty in an arm’s length transaction on the same date, then, at the request of Buyer, Seller will reasonably cooperate with Buyer to secure Seller’s or Seller’s Affiliate’s, if applicable, interest in its agreements, the Re-Pricing Agreement, the Seller Swap and any Specified Investment Agreement with a term that extends past the then-current Interest Rate Period to which Seller or any Affiliate is a party and all agreements related to any of the foregoing (“Transaction Documents”) to be novated to a replacement seller; provided that (w) a Rating Confirmation (as defined in the Bond Indenture) is obtained for any Bonds required to be tendered for purchase on the first Mandatory Purchase Date following the effective date of such novation, (x) the Swap Counterparty shall have provided its prior written consent to such assignment in accordance with the terms of the Seller Swap, (y) after giving effect to such novation, Seller will have no obligations (contingent or otherwise, including any obligation to make or repeat any representations or warranties other than basic representations on authority and the right to transfer its interests under this Agreement without encumbrances) or be required to make any payment under any Transaction Document or otherwise in connection with or following such novation other than any obligations that would have existed or payments that would have been required had this Agreement terminated as of the end of the last Reset Period that commenced prior to such novation, and (z) as it relates to clause (iii) above, Seller shall have a right to match the Reset Period Implied Rate provided by the potential novated counterparty.

ARTICLE XIV.  
PAYMENTS

Section 14.1 Monthly Statements.

(a) No later than the [7th] day of each Month during the Delivery Period (excluding the first Month of the Delivery Period) and the first Month following the end of the Delivery Period, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (a “Buyer’s Statement”) listing (i) for
<!-- Page 212 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+not+displayed)

each purchase of Replacement Gas or Replacement Electricity, the quantity and replacement price applicable to such purchase, and (ii) any other amounts due to Buyer in connection with this Agreement with respect to the prior Month(s).

(b) No later than the [12th] day of each Month during the Delivery Period (excluding the first Month of the Delivery Period) and the first Month following the end of the Delivery Period (the “Billing Date”), Seller shall deliver a statement (a “Billing Statement”) to Buyer indicating (i) the total amount due to Buyer, if any, under Article IV, Article V and Article VII and Exhibit C with respect to the prior Month(s), (ii) any amounts due to Seller in connection with this Agreement with respect to the prior Month(s), and (iii) the net amount due to Buyer or Seller. If the actual quantity delivered is not known by the Billing Date, Seller may provisionally prepare a Billing Statement based on Seller’s best available knowledge of the quantity of Commodities delivered, which shall not exceed the sum of the Contract Quantity of all the Gas Days or Hours (as applicable) in such Month plus any make-up quantities delivered during such Month. The invoiced quantity and amounts paid thereon (with interest calculated on the amount overpaid or underpaid by Buyer at the Default Rate) will then be adjusted on the following Month’s Billing Statement, as actual delivery information becomes available based on the actual quantity delivered. The Parties acknowledge and agree that all amounts owed to and from Seller in connection with the Commodity Project shall be paid pursuant to the SPE Master Custodial Agreement, and the Billing Statement may be provided by J. Aron, as Seller’s agent, in the form of a consolidated statement regarding all amounts owed to and from Seller in connection with the Commodity Project for each Month, including payments to be made under the Funding Agreement, the Commodity Credit and the Seller Swap.

(c) Upon request by either Party, the other Party shall deliver such supporting documentation of the foregoing as such requesting Party may reasonably request.

Section 14.2 Payment.

(a) If the Billing Statement indicates an amount due from Buyer, then Buyer shall remit such amount to Seller by wire transfer (pursuant to the instructions set forth in the SPE Master Custodial Agreement), in immediately available funds, on or before the later of (i) the 25th day of the Month following the most recent Month to which such Billing Statement relates, or (ii) the 10th day following Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s Billing Statement, or if either such day is not a Business Day, the following Business Day. If the Billing Statement indicates an amount due from Seller, then Seller shall remit such amount to Buyer by wire transfer (pursuant to Buyer’s instructions), in immediately available funds, on or before the later of (i) the 22nd day of the Month following the most recent Month to which such Billing Statement relates, or (ii) the 10th day following Seller’s receipt of Buyer’s Statement, or if either such day is not a Business Day, the preceding Business Day.

(b) If Buyer fails to issue a Buyer’s Statement with respect to any Month, Seller shall not be required to estimate any amounts due to Buyer for such Month, provided that Buyer may include any such amount on subsequent Buyer’s Statements issued within the next sixty (60) days. The sixty (60)-day deadline in this subsection (b) replaces the two (2)-year deadline in Section 14.5 with respect to any claim by any non-delivering Party of inaccuracy in any estimated invoice issued or payment made pursuant to this subsection (b). 

31
<!-- Page 213 -->
Section 14.3  Payment of Disputed Amounts. If Seller disputes any amounts included in the Buyer’s Statement, Seller shall (a) (except in the case of manifest error) nonetheless calculate the Billing Statement based on the amounts included in Buyer’s Statement and (b) pay any amount required by the Billing Statement in accordance with Section 14.2 without regard to any right of set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or other defenses to payment that Seller may have; provided, however, that Seller shall have the right, after payment, to dispute any amounts included in a Buyer’s Statement or otherwise used to calculate payments due under this Agreement pursuant to Section 14.5(b). If Buyer disputes any amounts included in the Billing Statement, Buyer may withhold payment to the extent of the disputed amount; provided, however, that interest shall be due at the Default Rate for any withheld amount later found to have been properly due.

Section 14.4  Late Payment. If a Party owing a net payment under Section 14.2 fails to remit the full amount payable within one Business Day of when due, interest on the unpaid portion shall accrue from the date due until the date of payment at the Default Rate.

Section 14.5  Audit; Adjustments.

(a) A Party shall have the right, at its own expense, upon reasonable notice to the other Party and at reasonable times, to examine and audit and to obtain copies of the relevant portion of the books, records, and telephone recordings of the other Party to the extent reasonably necessary, but only to such extent, to verify the accuracy of any statement, charge, payment, or computation made under this Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any examination and audit reveals any material discrepancy in the other Party’s books and records, the examining Party shall have a right to be reimbursed by the other Party for costs reasonably incurred in connection with such examination and audit. This right to examine, audit, and obtain copies shall not be available with respect to proprietary information not directly relevant to transactions under this Agreement.

(b) Each Buyer’s Statement and each Billing Statement shall be conclusively presumed final and accurate and all associated claims for under- or overpayments shall be deemed waived unless such Buyer’s Statement or Billing Statement is objected to in writing, with adequate explanation and/or documentation, within two (2) years after the applicable Month of Commodity delivery.

(c) All retroactive adjustments shall be paid in full by the Party owing payment within 30 days of notice and substantiation of such inaccuracy. If the Parties are unable to agree upon any retroactive adjustments requested by either Party within the time period specified in Section 14.5(b), then either Party may pursue any remedies available with respect to such adjustments at law or in equity. Retroactive adjustments for payments made based on incorrect Buyer’s Statements or Billing Statements shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date such payment was made. Buyer shall cause Project Participant to comply with the provisions of Section 14.5(a) to the extent necessary to allow Seller to verify any amounts due under this Agreement.

Section 14.6  Netting. The Parties shall net all amounts due and owing, including any past due amounts (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include any accrued interest), arising under this Agreement such that the Party owing the greater amount shall make a single payment of the net amount to the other Party in accordance with this Article XIV. Notwithstanding

32
<!-- Page 214 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

the foregoing, Seller shall not be entitled to net (i) any amounts that are in dispute or (ii) any payments due to Seller against (A) the Termination Payment if it becomes due, or (B) any payments due from Seller pursuant to Article IV, Article V or Exhibit C.

ARTICLE XV.  
PPA ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENTS

Section 15.1 Assignment by Project Participant. The Project Participant and the Buyer have agreed pursuant to Article XV of the Commodity Supply Contract that the Project Participant has the right to propose to assign certain Assigned Rights and Obligations under one or more power purchase agreements to J. Aron. If the Project Participant does so, and to the extent such assignment is accepted by J. Aron, Buyer, J. Aron, and the Project Participants have agreed to comply with Article XV of the Commodity Supply Contract. Following the effectiveness of any PPA Assignment Agreement and Assignment Schedule executed pursuant thereto, the Hourly Quantities of Electricity shall be reduced as contemplated by Article XV and Exhibit H of the Commodity Supply Contract to reflect the Commodities acquired by Seller pursuant to such assignment. References to Article XV and Exhibit H of the Commodity Supply Contract mean that Commodity Supply Contract as it originally exists, without regard to any modification, amendments, supplements or waivers thereto (including any embedded definitions or cross-referenced provisions) that have not been consented to by J. Aron in its sole discretion.

Section 15.2 Adjustments to Swaps. The Parties agree to issue appropriate notices to cause the Buyer and the Seller Swap to be revised for each Assignment Period such that the notional quantity under such swaps will be reduced to reflect the Reduced Hourly Quantity determined pursuant to Article XV of the Commodity Supply Contract; provided that such revisions will revert back effective as of the end of the Assignment Period pursuant to the terms of the Assignment Schedule and the applicable PPA Assignment Agreement.

Section 15.3 Early Termination of Assignment Period. Except for any Assignment Period that terminates contemporaneously with this Agreement, upon termination for any reason of the Assignment Period for any PPA Assignment Agreement, the Hourly Quantity shall be increased for all future periods to reverse any reductions to the Hourly Quantity made in connection with such PPA Assignment Agreement.

ARTICLE XVI.  
NOTICES

Any notice, demand, statement or request required or authorized by this Agreement to be given by one Party to the other Party (or to a third party) shall be in writing and shall either be sent by email transmission, courier, or personal delivery (including overnight delivery service) to each of the notice recipients and addresses specified in Exhibit B for the receiving Party. Any such notice, demand, statement or request shall be deemed to be given (i) when delivered by email transmission, or (ii) when actually received if delivered by courier or personal delivery (including overnight delivery service). Each Party shall have the right, upon 10 days’ prior written notice to the other Party, to change its list of notice recipients and addresses in Exhibit B. The Parties may mutually agree in writing at any time to deliver notices, demands or requests through alternate or additional methods. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may at any time notify the other

33

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
that any notice, demand, statement or request to it must be provided by email transmission for a specified period of time or until further notice, and any communications delivered by means other than email transmission during such time shall be ineffective.

## DEFAULT; REMEDIES; TERMINATION

### Section 17.1 Commodity Delivery Termination Events and Termination Payment Events. 
Each event listed on the table below constitutes a “Commodity Delivery Termination Event”. This table also specifies the potential Terminating Party for each Commodity Delivery Termination Event and identifies which Commodity Delivery Termination Events are also Termination Payment Events. For each Commodity Delivery Termination Event where the potential Terminating Party is listed as “Automatic”, such event is an “Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event” and each other Commodity Delivery Termination Event is an “Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event.”

Section 17.2 Payments Following a Ledger Event. Following the occurrence of a Ledger Event, Seller shall pay to Buyer any amounts that become payable from J. Aron to Seller pursuant to Section 17.6 of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, which amounts will accrue from the date of a Ledger Event until (but not including) the date on which a Termination Payment Event occurs.

Section 17.3 Reserved.

Section 17.4 Remedies and Termination.

(a) Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event. Upon the occurrence of any Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event, a Commodity Delivery Termination Date shall be deemed to be designated as the end of the Month in which the Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event occurs.

(b) Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event. If at any time an Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, then the Terminating Party, by notice to the other Party specifying the relevant Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event, may designate a day not earlier than the last day of the Month in which such notice is deemed given under Article XVI as the Commodity Delivery Termination Date; provided, however, that with respect to an Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event related to a Buyer Swap or Seller Swap, the Terminating Party may, at any time after the commencement of the Swap Replacement Period, conditionally designate a Commodity Delivery Termination Date, with such designation being conditioned upon (i) the termination and failure to replace either the corresponding Seller Swap or such Buyer Swap and (ii) the Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurring no earlier than the last day of the Month in which the Swap Replacement Period ends.

(c) Effect of Commodity Delivery Termination Date. As of the Commodity Delivery Termination Date, (i) the Delivery Period shall end, (ii) the obligation of Buyer to receive delivery of Commodities from Seller under this Agreement shall terminate, and (iii) the obligation of Seller to Schedule or make any further deliveries of Commodities to Buyer under this Agreement shall terminate and, unless such Commodity Delivery Termination Date resulted from a Termination Payment Event, such obligation to deliver Commodities shall be replaced with a continuing obligation to make payment of the amounts set forth in Exhibit D-3 to Buyer until the earlier of (A) the Month in which a Termination Payment Event occurs and (B) the last due date for such payments under Exhibit D-3. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) except as set forth in this Section 17.4(c) and in Section 17.4(d), this Agreement will continue past a Commodity Delivery Termination Date, and (ii) a Termination Payment Event may arise contemporaneously with a Commodity Delivery Termination Date or at any time thereafter and the occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date shall not prevent the occurrence of a Termination Payment Event.

(d) Termination Payment Event; Early Termination Payment Date. A Termination Payment Event shall occur upon (i) a Commodity Delivery Termination Event that is
<!-- Page 220 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

specified as a Termination Payment Event in Section 17.1 or (ii) a J. Aron Acceleration Option. Following a Termination Payment Event, Seller on the Early Termination Payment Date shall (A) pay the Termination Payment and (B) if applicable, pay the Additional Termination Payment, in each case, to the Trustee pursuant to payment instructions issued by Buyer or, in the absence of such instructions, by wire transfer. Such amounts shall be paid together with interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) from (and including) the Early Termination Payment Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Default Rate. The obligation of Seller to pay the Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date is unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby, any waiver or consent by Buyer, or any other circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of Seller or a defense of Seller to pay the Termination Payment. Seller waives all rights to set-off, counterclaim, recoupment and any other defenses that might otherwise be available to Seller with regard to Seller’s obligation to pay the Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date.

(e) Acknowledgement of Parties. The Parties acknowledge that it is impractical and difficult to assess actual damages as a result of a termination of the Delivery Period under this Agreement, and the Parties therefore agree that the payment of the Termination Payment and any applicable Additional Termination Payment or the continued payment of amounts specified in Exhibit D-3, as applicable, is a fair and reasonable pre-estimate of the actual damages that would be incurred by Buyer as a result of termination of the Delivery Period under this Agreement for any reason and is not a penalty.

(f) Exclusive Termination Rights. Neither this Agreement nor the Delivery Period may be terminated for any reason except as specified in this Article XVII and in Section 2.2. Except with respect to amounts due for periods prior to the Commodity Delivery Termination Date, the continued payment of amounts required to be made under Section 17.4(c), and, as applicable, the payment of the Termination Payment and any Additional Termination Payment shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for each Party upon the termination of the Delivery Period and this Agreement for any reason, including as a result of rejection of this Agreement by either Party in any bankruptcy proceedings.

(g) Payment of Investment Agreement Breakage Costs. In the event that a payment in respect of breakage costs becomes due from Buyer under a Specified Investment Agreement due to the occurrence of an Early Termination Payment Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the amount of such payment no later than the later of (A) one Business Day prior to the date such payment is required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to such Specified Investment Agreement and (B) one Business Day following receipt by Seller of a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the amount of such payment. In the event that a payment in respect of breakage costs becomes payable to Buyer under a Specified Investment Agreement due to the occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the amount of such payment no later than one Business Day following receipt of such payment by Buyer.

Section 17.5 Replacement of Swaps.
<!-- Page 221 -->
(a) Neither Party shall exercise any optional right it may have to terminate this Agreement as a result of the termination of any Seller Swap or any Buyer Swap without first complying with this Section 17.5. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees that it will not replace any Buyer Swap or Seller Swap, as applicable, unless the other Party is replacing its Buyer Swap or Seller Swap, as applicable, with the same replacement Swap Counterparty.

(b) If:
(i) any Buyer Swap or any Seller Swap terminates,
(ii) Buyer or Seller delivers a termination notice under a Buyer Swap or Seller Swap,
(iii) a Swap Counterparty delivers a termination notice under a Buyer Swap or Seller Swap, or
(iv) any Buyer Swap or any Seller Swap is otherwise reasonably anticipated to become subject to immediate termination,

then each Party whose swap is affected shall notify the other Party of the existence of such circumstances and identify the affected Buyer Swap or Seller Swap (the “Affected Swap”).

(c) Following receipt of a notice under Section 17.5(b), the Parties shall attempt to replace both the Affected Swap and the corresponding unaffected Seller Swap or Buyer Swap with the same Swap Counterparty (the “Unaffected Swap”) by:
(i) if a Buyer Swap and a Seller Swap with another Swap Counterparty are in effect and otherwise are not subject to termination, (A) exercise any rights they may have to increase their notional quantities under such Buyer Swap and Seller Swap in order to effect a replacement upon termination of the Affected Swap (which increase shall be deemed to be a replacement of both the Buyer Swap and Seller Swap for purposes of Section 17.5 if the full notional quantities of the Affected Swap are thereby replaced), and (B) subsequent to such a replacement, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to locate replacement agreements with a second Swap Counterparty and, upon locating a second Swap Counterparty, Seller and Buyer shall reduce their notional quantities under the remaining Seller Swap and Buyer Swap to their original levels and enter into a replacement Seller Swap and Buyer Swap with the replacement Swap Counterparty for the remaining notional quantities; or
(ii) to the extent Seller or Buyer cannot increase their notional quantities under another Buyer Swap and Seller Swap as contemplated by clause (i), cooperate in good faith to locate replacement agreements with an alternate Swap Counterparty to replace both the relevant Seller Swap and Buyer Swap within the Swap Replacement Period.

the Swap Counterparty to receive Unpaid Amounts (as defined therein) (any such payment under clause (iii), excluding any such Unpaid Amounts, a “Seller Swap MTM Payment”). As additional consideration hereunder, Buyer hereby transfers and assigns to Seller all of Buyer’s right, title, and interest to all payments and rights to receive payments, if any, that Buyer receives or becomes entitled to receive in the future arising as a result of or otherwise in respect of a Seller Swap MTM Payment. Buyer agrees that it will not take any steps to enforce any right to receive any payments that it has assigned to Seller pursuant to this Section 17.6(a).

(b) The Parties further acknowledge that the terms of the Seller Swaps do not entitle Seller to any payments in respect of any termination of a Seller Swap other than Unpaid Amounts (as defined therein). Nonetheless, Seller hereby presently transfers and assigns to Buyer all of Seller’s right, title and interest to any payments and rights to receive payments that Seller receives or becomes entitled to receive in the future arising as a result of or otherwise in respect of any early termination of a Seller Swap, excluding only any right for Seller to receive Unpaid Amounts thereunder.

Section 17.7 Limitation on Damages. THE PARTIES CONFIRM THAT THE EXPRESS REMEDIES AND MEASURES OF DAMAGES PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT SATISFY THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSES HEREOF. FOR BREACH OF ANY PROVISION FOR WHICH AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS HEREIN PROVIDED, SUCH EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, THE OBLIGOR’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED AS SET FORTH IN THIS PROVISION, AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES FOR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED. NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION, OR OTHERWISE. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE NEGLIGENCE OF EITHER PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE. TO THE EXTENT ANY DAMAGES REQUIRED TO BE PAID UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE LIQUIDATED, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE, OTHERWISE OBTAINING AN ADEQUATE REMEDY IS INCONVENIENT, AND THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CONSTITUTE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE HARM OR LOSS. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE MEASURE OF DAMAGES THAT WOULD MAKE THE PARTIES WHOLE, THE PARTIES HAVE THOROUGHLY CONSIDERED, INTER ALIA, THE UNCERTAINTY OF FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES, THE ABILITY AND INTENTION OF THE PARTIES TO HEDGE SUCH FLUCTUATIONS, THE BARGAINED-FOR ALLOCATION OF RISK, THE KNOWLEDGE, SOPHISTICATION AND EQUAL BARGAINING POWER OF THE PARTIES, THE ARMS-LENGTH NATURE OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS TRANSACTION, THE ACCOUNTING AND TAX TREATMENT OF THE TRANSACTION BY THE PARTIES, AND THE ENTERING INTO OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS IN RELIANCE ON THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISIONS CONTAINED HEREIN. THE PARTIES
<!-- Page 224 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A SALE OF GOODS SUBJECT TO ARTICLE 2 OF THE NEW YORK UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, §§ 2-706(6), 2-711, 2-718, AND 2-719.

**Section 17.8 Option to Purchase Bonds.** In connection with any new Interest Rate Period established under the Bond Indenture after the initial Interest Rate Period, Seller shall have the option to purchase Bonds to be remarked on the relevant Mandatory Purchase Date by delivering written notice to Buyer and the Trustee no later than the last Business Day of the Reset Period that Seller will purchase a quantity of Bonds necessary to avoid the occurrence of a Failed Remarketing. In the event that Seller exercises such option, (x) Seller shall be obligated to pay the purchase price of such Bonds in immediately available funds on the Mandatory Purchase Date, and (y) to the extent any CSC Remarketing Elections are in effect with respect to the Reset Period commencing immediately prior to such Interest Rate Period, then Seller shall be required to remarket the Contract Quantities associated with such CSC Remarketing Elections, provided that:

(a) Seller shall be entitled to purchase such Commodities for its own account,

(b) for all such Commodities, regardless of how it is remarked, Seller shall pay Buyer the amount determined pursuant to Section 5(d)(ii) of Exhibit C, and

(c) to the extent that it is determined that interest on the Bonds purchased by Seller is not excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes, Section 7 through Section 10 of Exhibit C shall not apply to any such remarketing.

**Section 17.9 Termination Payment Adjustment Schedule.** Seller shall prepare revisions to the then-current Exhibit D-2 (Termination Payment Adjustment Schedule) in connection with each successive Interest Rate Period pursuant to the terms of the Re-Pricing Agreement by delivering a revised Exhibit D-2 to Buyer no later than the last day of the applicable Reset Period, in which case such amendments will be effective as of the first day of the next Interest Rate Period.

**ARTICLE XVIII. RECEIVABLES PURCHASES**

In accordance with the provisions of Exhibit E, Seller has the option to purchase Call Receivables (as defined in Exhibit E). The Parties acknowledge and agree that any Call Receivables purchased by Seller under Exhibit E shall be re-purchased by J. Aron from Seller to the extent the conditions set forth in Exhibit C of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement are satisfied.

**ARTICLE XIX. MISCELLANEOUS**

**Section 19.1 Indemnification Procedure.** With respect to each indemnification included in this Agreement, the indemnity is given to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law and the following provisions shall be applicable.

assume its investigation and defense, including employment of counsel, and shall be obligated to pay related court costs, attorneys’ fees and experts’ fees and to post any appeals bonds; provided, however, that the indemnified Party shall have the right to employ at its expense separate counsel and participate in the defense of any Claim. The indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of a Claim without its express written consent thereto. In order to prevent double recovery, the indemnified Party shall reimburse the indemnifying Party for payments or costs incurred in respect of an indemnity with the proceeds of any judgment, insurance, bond, surety or other recovery made by the indemnified Party with respect to a covered event.

**Section 19.2 Deliveries.** No later than delivery of the Prepayment, Buyer will deliver to Seller a copy of the Bond Indenture. The following documents shall be executed and delivered by the Parties contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement (unless otherwise specified):

(a) by Seller no later than the date of issuance of the Bonds, a copy of the Funding Agreement;

(b) by Buyer, a certificate of the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of Buyer setting forth (i) the resolutions of its governing body with respect to the authorization of Buyer to execute and deliver this Agreement, the Bond Indenture and the Commodity Supply Contract, (ii) the appropriate individuals who are authorized to sign such agreements, (iii) specimen signatures of such authorized individuals, and (iv) the organization documents of Buyer, certified as being true and complete; and

(c) by Seller, evidence reasonably satisfactory to Buyer of (i) Seller’s authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and (ii) the appropriate individuals who are authorized to sign this Agreement.

**Section 19.3 Entirety; Amendments.**

(a) This Agreement, the Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Re-Pricing Agreement, including the exhibits and attachments hereto and thereto, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes all prior discussions and agreements between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations affecting the same subject matter other than those expressed herein and in the Receivables Purchase Agreement and the Re-Pricing Agreement. Except for any matters that, in accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement, may be resolved by oral agreement between the Parties, no amendment, modification, supplement or change hereto shall be enforceable unless reduced to writing and executed by both Parties.

(b) If a Ledger Event occurs, then Buyer and Seller may, upon mutual agreement in each Party’s sole discretion, amend this Agreement to reduce the Contract Quantity for one or more subsequent Months and to obligate Seller to pay the Trustee for the account of Buyer, an amount sufficient, together with other funds available under the terms of the Bond Indenture for such purpose, to pay the redemption price of such Bonds due on such redemption date and any settlement payable by Buyer due to the corresponding amendment to the Buyer Swap, and Buyer and Seller may simultaneously amend Exhibit D to reduce the Termination Payment.
<!-- Page 226 -->
for one or more such Months, but in each case only if Buyer and Seller have delivered to the Trustee:

(i) An executed counterpart of such amendment;

(ii) An executed counterpart of an amendment to the Commodity Supply Contract reducing the Contract Quantity to be sold and delivered thereunder in the same Months by the same quantities;

(iii) An executed counterpart of an amendment to the Buyer Swap reducing the notional amounts thereunder for the same Months by the same quantities;

(iv) A revised Schedule 1 and, if necessary, Schedule II to the Bond Indenture and any applicable notices required by the Bond Indenture in connection with any related partial redemption;

(v) An Accountant’s Certificate (as defined in the Bond Indenture) to the effect that each of (A) the scheduled Termination Payments for this Agreement for each Month thereafter is equal to or exceeds the aggregate principal amount of and interest on the Bonds scheduled to remain outstanding at the beginning of such Month, assuming that the Bonds are redeemed in accordance with the Bond Indenture, less the scheduled balance of the Debt Service Fund (as defined in the Bond Indenture) at the end of such Month and (B) the expected cashflow to the Trust Estate (as defined in the Bond Indenture) is sufficient to meet the ongoing debt service for the Bonds scheduled to remain outstanding; and

(vi) A Rating Confirmation (as defined in the Bond Indenture) in respect of such amendments and redemption.

Section 19.4 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED, ENFORCED AND PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLE THAT WOULD DIRECT THE APPLICATION OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION’S LAW; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE AUTHORITY OF BUYER TO ENTER INTO AND PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

Section 19.5 Non-Waiver. No waiver of any breach of any of the terms of this Agreement shall be effective unless such waiver is in writing and signed by the Party against whom such waiver is claimed. No waiver of any breach shall be deemed a waiver of any other subsequent breach.

Section 19.6 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, shall for any reason be invalid or unenforceable, then to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby, but rather shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible under applicable Law, so long as the economic and legal substance of the

transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any materially adverse manner as to either Party.

**Section 19.7 Exhibits.** Any and all Exhibits referenced in this Agreement are hereby incorporated herein by reference and shall be deemed to be an integral part hereof.

**Section 19.8 Winding Up Arrangements.** All indemnity and confidentiality obligations, audit rights, and other provisions specifically providing for survival shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. The expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not relieve either Party of (a) any unfulfilled obligation or undischarged liability of such Party on the date of such termination or (b) the consequences of any breach or default of any warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement. All obligations and liabilities described in the preceding sentence of this Section 19.8, and applicable provisions of this Agreement creating or relating to such obligations and liabilities, shall survive such expiration or termination.

**Section 19.9 Relationships of Parties.** The Parties shall not be deemed to be in a relationship of partners or joint venturers by virtue of this Agreement, nor shall either Party be an agent, representative, trustee or fiduciary of the other, except that Seller shall act on behalf of Buyer in marketing Commodities pursuant to Exhibit C. Neither Party shall have any authority to bind the other to any agreement. This Agreement is intended to secure and provide for the services of each Party as an independent contractor.

**Section 19.10 Immunity.** Buyer represents and covenants to and agrees with Seller that it is not entitled to claim immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or other similar grounds with respect to itself from (i) suit or (ii) jurisdiction of any court because of its status as a political subdivision of the State of California; provided that the foregoing relates only to contractual claims and not to any claim based in tort.

**Section 19.11 Rates and Indices.**

(a) **Daily Gas Reference Prices.**

(i) **Price Replacement Process for Gas, Fewer than Six Consecutive Gas Days.** If a Daily Commodity Reference Price for Gas is not available for any Gas Day for any reason, then such Daily Commodity Reference Price for such Gas Day shall be the average of the following: (A) the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price for the first Gas Day for which a price has been published that immediately precedes the relevant Gas Day; and (B) the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price for the first Gas Day for which a Daily Commodity Reference Price is published that immediately follows the relevant Gas Day; provided that any unavailability of a Daily Commodity Reference Price lasting for six (6) or more consecutive Gas Days or arising from a permanent cessation of publication of such Daily Commodity Reference Price shall be resolved in accordance with clause (ii) or clause (iii) of this Section 19.11(a), respectively.

(ii) **Price Replacement Process, Electricity or Six or More Consecutive Gas Days.** If a Daily Commodity Reference Price for Electricity is not available for any Hour or a Daily Commodity Reference Price for Gas is not available for six (6) consecutive Gas Days but, either case, such Daily Commodity Reference Price has not permanently
<!-- Page 228 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)  
**Price Replacement Process for Non-Published Index.**  
If a Daily Commodity Reference Price is not available because it has permanently ceased to be published, then the Parties shall promptly endeavor to agree on an alternative source for determination of such Daily Commodity Reference Price for the applicable Gas Days or Hours. If such agreement is not reached by the Parties within three (3) Business Days, the Parties shall request quotations for the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price from four (4) recognized dealers in the applicable Commodity (two (2) selected by each Party) for the period that such Daily Commodity Reference Price is expected to be unavailable. If four (4) quotations are provided as requested, the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price for the applicable Gas Days or Hours shall be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by each recognized dealer after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then one (1) of such quotations shall be disregarded. If exactly three (3) quotations are provided, the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price for the applicable Gas Days or Hours shall be the quotation provided by the relevant dealer that remains after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then the value of the two (2) quotations with the same value shall control. If fewer than three (3) quotations are provided, the Parties shall seek additional quotations until at least three (3) have been received.

(iii) **Price Replacement Process for Non-Published Index.**  
If a Daily Commodity Reference Price is not available because it has permanently ceased to be published, then the Parties shall promptly endeavor to agree on an alternative source for determination of such Daily Commodity Reference Price, which may include relying upon a published index or a basket of published indices (“Daily Replacement Index”) from which to seek quotes for basis differentials as the replacement for the applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price. If such agreement is not reached by the Parties within three (3) Business Days, then the Daily Replacement Index shall be selected by Seller, acting reasonably. The Parties shall request quotations from four (4) recognized dealers in the applicable Commodity (two (2) selected by each Party) for a basis differential (“Daily Basis Differential”) between the Daily Replacement Index and physical prices at the relevant Delivery Point for the remaining term of this Agreement. If four (4) quotations are provided as requested, the Daily Basis Differential will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by each recognized dealer, after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then one (1) of such quotations shall be disregarded. If exactly three (3) quotations are provided, the Daily Basis Differential shall be the quotation provided by the relevant dealer that remains after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then the value of the two (2) quotations with the same value shall control. If fewer than three (3) quotations are provided, the Parties shall seek additional quotations until at least three (3) have been received. The applicable Daily Commodity Reference Price shall be the Daily Replacement Index plus the Daily Basis Differential calculated in accordance with the provisions of this clause (iii).

(b) **Monthly Index Prices.**  
10
<!-- Page 229 -->
(i) Price Replacement Process. If a Monthly Index Price is not available for any Gas Day for any reason (but such Monthly Index Price has not permanently ceased to be published), then the Parties shall promptly endeavor to negotiate in good faith to select a suitable substitute price. If such agreement is not reached by the Parties within three (3) Business Days, the Parties shall request quotations from four (4) recognized dealers in Gas (two (2) selected by each Party). If four (4) quotations are provided as requested, the applicable Monthly Index Price for that Gas Day shall be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by each recognized dealer after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then one (1) of such quotations shall be disregarded. If exactly three (3) quotations are provided, the applicable Monthly Index Price for that Gas Day shall be the quotation provided by the relevant dealer that remains after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then the value of the two (2) quotations with the same value shall control. If fewer than three (3) quotations are provided, the Parties shall seek additional quotations until at least three (3) have been received.

(ii) Price Replacement Process for Non-Published Index. If a Monthly Index Price is not available because it has permanently ceased to be published, then the Parties shall promptly endeavor to agree on an alternative source for determination of such Monthly Index Price, which may include agreeing upon a published index or a basket of published indices (“Monthly Replacement Index”) from which to seek quotes for basis differentials as the replacement for the applicable Monthly Index Price. If agreement is not reached by the Parties within three (3) Business Days, then the Monthly Replacement Index shall be selected by Seller, acting reasonably. The Parties shall request quotations from four (4) recognized dealers in Gas (two (2) selected by each Party) for a basis differential (“Monthly Basis Differential”) between the Monthly Replacement Index and physical prices at the relevant Delivery Point for the remaining term of this Agreement. If four (4) quotations are provided as requested, the Monthly Basis Differential shall be the arithmetic mean of the quotations provided by each recognized dealer after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then one (1) of such quotations shall be disregarded. If exactly three (3) quotations are provided, the Monthly Basis Differential shall be the quotation provided by the relevant dealer that remains after disregarding the quotations having the highest and lowest values; provided that, if more than one (1) quotation has the same value, then the value of the two (2) quotations with the same value shall control. If fewer than three (3) quotations are provided, the Parties shall seek additional quotations until at least three (3) have been received. The applicable Monthly Index Price shall be the Monthly Replacement Index plus the Monthly Basis Differential calculated in accordance with the provisions of this clause (ii).

(c) Corrections. If a value published for any rate or index used or to be used in this Agreement is subsequently corrected and the correction is published or announced by the Person responsible for that publication or announcement within thirty (30) days after the original publication or announcement, either Party may notify the other Party of (i) that correction and (ii) the amount (if any) that is payable as a result of that correction. If, not later than thirty (30) days after publication or announcement of that correction, a Party gives notice that an amount is payable, then the correction shall apply.
<!-- Page 230 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

so payable, the Party that originally either received or retained such amount shall, not later than three (3) Business Days after the effectiveness of that notice, pay, subject to any other applicable provisions of this Agreement, to the other Party that amount, together with interest on that amount at the Default Rate for the period from and including the day on which a payment originally was (or was not) made to but excluding the day of payment of the refund or payment resulting from that correction.

**Section 19.12 Limitation of Liability.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all obligations of Buyer under this Agreement, including without limitation all obligations to make payments of any kind whatsoever, are special, limited obligations of Buyer, payable solely from the Trust Estate (as such term is defined in the Bond Indenture) as and to the extent provided in the Bond Indenture, including with respect to Operating Expenses (as such term is defined in the Bond Indenture). Buyer shall not be required to advance any moneys derived from any source other than the Revenues (as such term is defined in the Bond Indenture) and other assets pledged under the Bond Indenture for any of the purposes in this Agreement mentioned. Neither the faith and credit of Buyer nor the taxing power of the State of California or any political subdivision thereof is pledged to payments pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall not be directly, indirectly, contingently or otherwise liable for any costs, expenses, losses, damages, claims or actions, of any conceivable kind on any conceivable theory, under or by reasons of or in connection with this Agreement, except solely to the extent Revenues (as such term is defined in the Bond Indenture) are received for the payment thereof and may be applied therefor pursuant to the terms of the Bond Indenture.

**Section 19.13 Counterparts.** This Agreement may be executed and acknowledged in multiple counterparts and by the Parties in separate counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which shall be and constitute one and the same instrument.

**Section 19.14 Modification of and Compliance with Bond Indenture.** Buyer agrees and covenants that, as long as this Agreement is in effect, it shall not amend or consent to the amendment of any provision of the Bond Indenture (including without limitation Article V of the Bond Indenture), or fail to comply with any covenant applying to Buyer thereunder, that would, in any such case, be reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on Seller, J. Aron, the effectiveness of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Seller, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

**Section 19.15 Rights of Trustee.** Pursuant to the terms of the Bond Indenture, Buyer has irrevocably appointed the Trustee as its agent to issue notices (including Remarketing Notices) and as directed under the Bond Indenture, to take any other actions that Buyer is required or permitted to take under this Agreement. Seller may rely on notices or other actions taken by Buyer or the Trustee and Seller has the right to exclusively rely on any notices delivered by the Trustee, regardless of any conflicting notices that it may receive from Buyer.

**Section 19.16 Waiver of Defenses.** Seller waives all rights to set-off, counterclaim, recoupment and any other defenses that might otherwise be available to Seller with regard to Seller’s obligations pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

**Section 19.17 Rate Changes.**
<!-- Page 231 -->
(a) Absent the agreement of the Parties to the proposed change, the standard of review for changes to any rate, charge, classification, term or condition of this Agreement, whether proposed by a Party (to the extent that any waiver in Section 19.17(b) below is unenforceable or ineffective as to such Party), a non-party or FERC acting sua sponte, shall solely be the “public interest” application of the “just and reasonable” standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956) and Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348 (1956) and clarified by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish, 554 U.S. 527 (2008).

(b) In addition, and notwithstanding Section 19.17(a), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party, for itself and its successors and assigns, hereby expressly and irrevocably waives any rights it can or may have, now or in the future, whether under Section 205 and/or 206 of the Federal Power Act or otherwise, to seek to obtain from FERC by any means, directly or indirectly (through complaint, investigation or otherwise), and each hereby covenants and agrees not at any time to seek to obtain, an order from FERC changing any section of this Agreement specifying the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition agreed to by the Parties, it being the express intent of the Parties that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, neither Party shall unilaterally seek to obtain from FERC any relief changing the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition of this Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent changes in applicable Law or market conditions that may occur. In the event it were to be determined that applicable Law precludes the Parties from waiving their rights to seek changes from FERC to their market-based power sales contracts (including entering into covenants not to do so) then this Section 19.17(b) shall not apply; provided that, consistent with Section 19.17(a), neither Party shall seek any such changes except solely under the “public interest” application of the “just and reasonable” standard of review and otherwise as set forth in Section 19.17(a).

Section 19.18 U.S. Resolution Stay Provisions. Seller and Buyer hereby confirm that they are adherents to the ISDA 2018 U.S. Resolution Stay Protocol (“ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol”), the terms of the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol are incorporated into and form a part of this Agreement, and for the purposes of such incorporation, (i) Seller shall be deemed to be a Regulated Entity, (ii) Buyer shall be deemed to be an Adhering Party, and (iii) this Agreement shall be deemed a Protocol Covered Agreement. In the event of any inconsistencies between this Agreement and the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol, the ISDA U.S. Stay Protocol will prevail.7

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Prepaid Commodity Sales Agreement to be duly executed and delivered by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.

(a) Seller shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remarket or cause to be remarketed all Commodities specified for Initial Remarketing. In exercising such Commercially Reasonable Efforts, Seller shall first attempt to remarket or cause to be remarked all Commodities specified in a Remarketing Notice in Qualified Sales and then, if Seller is unable to so remarket all of such Commodities for such purposes, in Non-Private Business Sales. If Seller is unable to remarket all or any portion of the Commodities designated in a Remarketing Notice, then Seller shall purchase such Commodities for its own account at the prices set forth in Section 5(d) of this Exhibit C as if such Commodities had been remarketed to it.

(iii) In the event the payment due date under a Qualified Sale or Non-Private Business Sale has not yet occurred prior to the date upon which payment is due under this Agreement for the applicable Month, the Parties shall nonetheless issue statements as if the full amount from such Qualified Sale or Non-Private Business Sale had been paid and, if such full payment is not received prior to the next Monthly due date under this Agreement, the Parties shall issue the appropriate statements to reflect the actual proceeds received and true-up any difference.

(d) Proceeds from Private Business Sales.

(i) For any Commodities specified in a Monthly Remarketing Notice that are not remarketed in a Qualified Sale or Non-Private Business Sale, Seller shall pay to Buyer the positive result determined by the following formula with respect to each Delivery Point to which such Monthly Remarketing Notice applied:

RF = The Remarketing Fee  

(ii) For any Commodities specified in a Daily Remarketing Notice that are not remarketed in a Qualified Sale or Non-Private Business Sale, Seller shall pay to Buyer the positive result determined by the following formula with respect to each Delivery Point to which such Daily Remarketing Notice applied:  
P = Q x (IPL - RF)  
Where:  
P = The amount payable by Seller under this Section 5(d)(ii)

For purposes of the foregoing, Seller shall be considered to have resolved such Electricity to the extent Seller shall have entered into one or more arrangements in a Commercially Reasonable manner whereby Seller repurchases its obligation to purchase and receive Electricity from another party at the Delivery Point

RF = The Remarketing Fee

AF = The Administrative Fee, provided that the Administrative Fee shall not apply during the Electricity Delivery Period unless such Deemed Remarketing Notice results from Buyer’s failure to Schedule pursuant to Section 4.2 of the Agreement

Section 7. Tracking Remarketing Proceeds. Seller shall maintain four (4) separate ledgers related to remarketing proceeds as described below:

(a) One (1) ledger (the “Non-Private Business Sales Ledger”) shall include, (A) as dollar credits, the Non-Private Business Remarketing Proceeds, and (B) as a Unit credit, the Units of Commodities corresponding to such Non-Private Business Remarketing Proceeds.

(b) Another ledger (the “Private Business Sales Ledger”) shall include, (A) as dollar credits, Private Business Remarketing Proceeds, and (B) as a Unit credit, the Units of Commodities corresponding to such Private Business Remarketing Proceeds.

(c) The other two (2) ledgers shall be maintained as described in Section 9(a) of this Exhibit C.

(d) The credits to be recorded in the ledgers described in Section 7(a) and (b) of this Exhibit C (collectively, the “Ledger Entries”) shall be dated as of the first day of the Month prior to the Month in which Buyer or Project Participant receives the proceeds corresponding to such Ledger Entries.
<!-- Page 244 -->
(e) The four (4) ledgers described in Section 7 of this Exhibit C and all debits and credits to such ledgers shall be kept on an aggregate basis for purposes of this Exhibit C.

(f) Buyer shall provide to Seller all reports provided by a Project Participant pursuant to Section 7.5 of the applicable Commodity Supply Contract. To the extent set forth in Section 7.6(a) of the applicable Commodity Supply Contract, Seller will add “Disqualified Sale Proceeds” to the appropriate ledgers described above.

**Section 8. Remediation Remarketing and Bond Redemptions.**

(a) At any time that the net Ledger Entry balance of either the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger or the Private Business Sales Ledger is greater than zero (0):

(b) Buyer shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to utilize the proceeds represented by the dollar balances of such Ledger Entries to purchase Commodities for resale in Qualified Sales and shall promptly notify Seller following such purchase and sale.

(c) Seller shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to locate opportunities for Buyer to purchase Commodities to sell in Qualified Sales to remediate the proceeds represented by the dollar balances of the Ledger Entries. In this regard, if Seller locates a Remediation Remarketing opportunity, then

(i) Seller shall notify Buyer of such opportunity;

(ii) Buyer shall, upon receipt of such notice, purchase Commodities from Seller at a price determined by Seller in a Commercially Reasonable manner based upon applicable market prices at the location where the remarketing opportunity sale will occur (the “Remediation Remarketing Purchase Price”);

(iii) Seller shall remarket such Commodities on Buyer’s behalf in a Qualified Sale;

(iv) Seller shall remit to Buyer the proceeds collected from such Qualified Sale, but in no event shall Seller remit less than the Minimum Remarketing Sales Price for the remarketing transaction; provided, however, that to the extent Seller does not receive the Remediation Remarketing Purchase Price from Buyer prior to the Remediation Remarketing described herein, Seller shall credit the proceeds collected from such remarketing sale against the Remediation Remarketing Purchase Price owed to Seller, and Seller shall be reimbursed from the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund to the extent necessary to make Seller whole for such Qualified Sale; and

(v) Seller shall issue to Buyer a confirmation notice (including the dollar price and Units) of each purchase of Commodities by or on behalf of Buyer, and each sale of Commodities on Buyer’s behalf, under this Section 8, and amounts due from or to Buyer shall be separately stated on the Billing Statement for the Month in which such remarketing transactions occur.

C-9
<!-- Page 245 -->
For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not sell, nor be required to sell, Commodities to Buyer for a Remediation Remarketing if such Commodities are to be remarketed by Seller on behalf of Buyer for less than the Minimum Remarketing Sales Price.

(d) Unless the terms of a Remediation Remarketing undertaken by Seller on Buyer’s behalf are specifically assumed by Buyer, Seller shall indemnify Buyer for any costs or liabilities associated with such Remediation Remarketing (other than costs related to the price at which such Commodities are sold and the risk of collecting the sale proceeds from the remarketing buyer), including, without limitation, any cover or replacement costs; termination payments; fees, penalties, costs or charges (in cash or in kind) assessed by any Transporter for failure to satisfy its balance or nomination requirements; Claims for breach of warranty; taxes, fees, levies, penalties, licenses or charges imposed by any Government Agency; and Claims from personal injury or property damages.

(e) The total purchase price of any Commodities purchased by Buyer or Seller pursuant to Section 8(c) of this Exhibit C will be entered by Seller as a dollar debit on (i) first, the Private Business Sales Ledger, if and to the extent such ledger has a positive balance and such Commodities are remarketed in a Qualified Sale and (ii) second, on the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger, if and to the extent such ledger has a positive balance, the Private Business Sales Ledger has a zero (0) balance, and such Commodities are remarketed in a Qualified Sale, with such debit in the case of (i) or (ii) dated as of the last day of the Month in which such Commodities were purchased. Each dollar debit shall offset and reverse an equal amount of the dollar credits to such ledger that had previously been entered to the Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger or the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger in the order in which they were made (beginning with the oldest credit not previously offset and reversed by any prior debit). Whenever a debit is made to the dollar balance of the Ledger Entries of either such ledger, Seller shall also debit the Commodities balance of the Ledger Entries of such ledger based on (i) such dollar debit divided by (ii) an average Commodities price calculated from the net Ledger Entry then present on the relevant ledger being debited. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger nor the Private Business Sales Ledger shall ever have a negative balance, and the same purchase transaction shall not result in a debit to more than one ledger except to the extent that a debit for the transaction causes one (1) ledger to have a zero (0) balance and the remaining portion of the permitted debit is made to the other ledger.

(f) In addition to the ability of Seller or Buyer to engage in Remediation Remarketing to reduce the balances of any Ledger Entries through Qualified Sales of the Commodity (either Gas or Electricity) that was originally remarketed the proceeds represented by the dollar balances of such Ledger Entries may also be remediated through the purchase of the other Commodity (either Electricity or Gas) that will be remarketed in Qualified Sales. If Seller locates an opportunity for Buyer to purchase the other Commodity for a Remediation Remarketing, the provisions of Section 8c shall apply to such opportunity provided that the entry of Unit debits shall be made as follows:

(i) To the extent the Ledger Entries for Units consist of MMBtus, for any Remediation Remarketing of Electricity, a quantity of MMBtus will be debited based on (i) the total proceeds paid for such Electricity divided by (ii) an average Gas price.
<!-- Page 246 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image) 

calculated from the net Ledger Entry balance then present on the relevant ledger being debited.

(ii) To the extent the Ledger Entries for Units consist of MWhs, for any Remediation Remarketing of Gas, a quantity of MWhs will be debited based on (i) the total proceeds paid for such Gas divided by (ii) an average Electricity price calculated from the net Ledger Entry balance then present on the relevant ledger being debited.

(g) In the event that (i) the Project Participant remediates the proceeds represented by the dollar balances of the Ledger Entries pursuant to Section 7.5 of the Commodity Supply Contract or (ii) Bonds are redeemed pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.6(c) of the Commodity Supply Contract and Section 4.01(b) of the Bond Indenture, the corresponding Ledger Entries then present on any ledger shall be debited.

(h) Upon the Switch Date, all Ledger Entries for Units consisting of MMBtus shall be converted to MWhs based on an average Gas price calculated from the net Ledger Entry balance then present on the relevant ledger being debited.

Section 9. Ledger Event.

(a) In addition to the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger and the Private Business Sales Ledger described in Section 7(a) and (b) of this Exhibit C, above, Seller shall also maintain an “Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger” and an “Expired Private Business Sales Ledger.” Whenever a credit to the dollar balance of the Ledger Entries of the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger has not been reversed in full within two (2) years of such credit by an offsetting dollar debit in accordance with Section 8(c) or (d) of this Exhibit C, then Seller shall (i) debit the remaining portion of such dollar credit and the Unit balance of the Ledger Entries in the manner described in the penultimate sentence of Section 8(c) and (ii) record such debits as credits to the Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger. Similarly, whenever a credit to the dollar balance of the Ledger Entries of the Private Business Sales Ledger has not been reversed in full within two (2) years of such credit by an offsetting dollar debit in accordance with Section 8(c) or (d) of this Exhibit C, then Seller shall (i) debit the remaining portion of such dollar credit and the Unit balance of the Ledger Entries in the manner described in the penultimate sentence of Section 8(c) and (ii) record such debits as credits to the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger. Pursuant to Section 19.3(b) of the Agreement, upon any partial redemption of Bonds in accordance with the Bond Indenture, the dollar credits made to either the Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger or the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger shall be reduced (in the order of entry) by an aggregate amount corresponding to the principal amount of Bonds so redeemed, and the Unit credits to such ledgers shall be reduced by the contemporaneous Unit credits corresponding to the dollar credits so reduced.

(b) No later than the tenth (10th) day of each Month, Seller shall provide to Buyer copies of the Non-Private Business Sales Ledger, the Private Business Sales Ledger, the Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger and the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger showing all credits and debits to each such ledger since the Execution Date, in each case if a credit has been recorded in such ledger since the Execution Date.

C-11
<!-- Page 247 -->
(c) A “Ledger Event” shall occur if, at any time, either (i) (A) the sum of all Btu credits on the Expired Non-Private Business Sales Ledger and the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger exceeds (B) the Non-Qualifying Remarketing Limit, or (ii) (A) the sum of all Btu credits on the Expired Private Business Sales Ledger exceeds (B) the Private Business Remarketing Limit.

(d) The occurrence of a Ledger Event and any remedies associated therewith in Article XVII of the Agreement shall be Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedies with respect to any inability by Seller to purchase and remarket Commodities for Buyer pursuant to, or any breach by Seller of its obligations under, this Exhibit C.

Section 10. Remarketing of Contract Quantities under Gas Assignment Agreement or PPA Assignment Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein but subject to the immediately following sentence of this Section 10, if (a) a quantity of Commodities less than (x) the Assigned Gas Quantity as defined in a Gas Assignment Agreement or (y) the Assigned Prepay Quantity as defined in a PPA Assignment Agreement is delivered or taken hereunder in any Month during an Assignment Period for any reason other than Force Majeure, then (i) Buyer will be deemed to have requested Seller to remarket the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered (regardless of whether a Remarketing Notice was delivered) and (ii) Seller shall sell such Commodities or cause such Commodities to be sold in a Private Business Sale at the Contract Specified Price minus the applicable Remarketing Fee. Seller shall pay Buyer for any such Month the product of (I) the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered, multiplied by (II) the Contract Specified Price minus the applicable Remarketing Fee, and such sales shall constitute a Private Business Sale and shall be reflected on the Private Business Sales Ledger.

Section 2.2 Swap Deficiency Receivables. Prepay LLC shall have an option to purchase certain Swap Deficiency Receivables from Issuer as described in this Section 2.2. Issuer shall sell to Prepay LLC, and Prepay LLC shall purchase, certain Swap Deficiency Receivables under the following circumstances:

(a) If (i) the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under the Commodity Supply Contract with Issuer and (ii) such payment default results in a Swap Payment Deficiency, then on the Business Day following the day on which such default occurs, Issuer shall deliver a written offer (a “Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer”) in the form of Attachment 3 to this Exhibit to sell to Prepay LLC, at par, sufficient receivables (“Swap Deficiency Receivables”) (such amount, less any undisputed amounts owed by Issuer to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, the “Swap Deficiency Receivables Amount”) to fund the Swap Payment Deficiency. Such Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer shall identify the Project Participant and include aging information and the face amount of the corresponding Swap Deficiency Receivables.

(b) No later than the Business Day following Prepay LLC’s receipt of a Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer, Prepay LLC may, but shall be under no obligation to, elect to purchase the Swap Deficiency Receivables referenced in the Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer by delivering a written notice (a “Swap Deficiency Receivable Option Notice”) in the form of Attachment 4 to this Exhibit to Issuer and the Trustee of Prepay LLC’s intent to purchase such Swap Deficiency Receivables (collectively, the “Swap Deficiency Identified Receivables”). The Swap Deficiency Receivable Option Notice will specify a Purchase Date that will be no later than the Payment Date (as defined in the Confirmation to the Buyer Swap) for the month in which Prepay LLC receives the Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer. If Prepay LLC does not deliver a Swap Deficiency Receivable Option Notice to Issuer and the Trustee on or before the Business Day following Prepay LLC’s receipt of a Swap Deficiency Receivables Offer, Prepay LLC will be deemed to have elected not to purchase the referenced Swap Deficiency Receivables.

The Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any of the foregoing proceedings and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Person unless the Indemnified Person shall in good faith determine that there exist actual or potential conflicts of interest which make representation by the same counsel inappropriate.

provision of the Bond Indenture (including without limitation Article V of the Bond Indenture) that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the effectiveness of this Exhibit or the transactions contemplated by this Exhibit without the prior written consent of the Transferee, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

Majure under this Agreement if it affected Issuer directly.

Force Majeure shall not be based on (i) the loss of Purchaser’s markets; (ii) Purchaser’s inability economically to use or resell the Commodities purchased hereunder; (iii) the loss or failure of Issuer’s supply except if such loss or failure results from curtailment by a Transmission Provider; or (iv) Issuer’s ability to sell the Commodities at a higher price. Neither Party may raise a claim of Force Majeure based in whole or in part on curtailment by a Transmission Provider unless (i) such Party has contracted for firm transmission with such Transmission Provider for the Commodities to be delivered to or received at the Delivery Point and (ii) such curtailment is due to “force majeure” or “uncontrollable force” or a similar term as defined under the Transmission Provider’s tariff; provided, however, that existence of the foregoing factors shall not be sufficient to conclusively or presumptively prove the existence of Force Majeure absent a showing of other facts and circumstances which in the aggregate with such factors establish that Force Majeure as defined in the first sentence of this sub-paragraph (b) has occurred. In addition to the foregoing and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that a PPA Assignment Agreement is terminated early, such termination shall constitute Force Majeure with respect to Issuer hereunder until the end of the first Month following the Month in which such early termination occurs.

With respect to any measurement of Gas delivered or received under this Agreement at any Delivery Point, the measurement of such Gas (including the definition of Btu used in making such measurement) by the operator of such Delivery Point shall be deemed to be conclusive; provided, however, if the operator of such Delivery Point revises its measurement statements for Gas, such revision shall be effective as the measurement of Gas for the purposes of this Agreement and may be corrected pursuant to Section 14.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, but without prejudice to any right of Project Participant to reject Assigned Gas under and as defined in a Gas Assignment Agreement, measurement of Assigned Gas shall be as set forth in the applicable Upstream Supply Contract and Issuer shall not have any liability for the failure of any Assigned Gas to meet any applicable quality requirements.

ARTICLE VII  
USE OF COMMODITIES

Section 7.1 Tax Exempt Status of the Bonds. Purchaser acknowledges that the Bonds will be issued with the intention that the interest thereon will be exempt from federal taxes under Section 103 of the Code. Accordingly, Purchaser agrees that it will (a) provide such information with respect to its utility system as may be requested by Issuer in order to establish the tax-exempt status of the Bonds, and (b) act in accordance with such written instructions as Issuer may provide from time to time in order to maintain the tax-exempt status of the Bonds. Purchaser further agrees that it will not at any time take any action, or fail to take any action, that would adversely affect the tax-exempt status of the Bonds.

Section 7.2 Priority Commodities. Purchaser agrees to take the Contract Quantities to be delivered under this Agreement (a) in priority over and in preference to all other Commodities available to Purchaser that are not Priority Commodities; and (b) on at least a pari passu and non-discriminatory basis with other Priority Commodities.

Section 7.3 Assistance with Sales to Third Parties. If, notwithstanding Purchaser’s compliance with Section 7.1, Purchaser does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Contract Quantity that it is obligated to purchase under this Agreement as a result of (i) decreased Gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period, (ii) decreased demand by Purchaser’s retail customers or (iii) a change in Law, Issuer shall, upon reasonable notice from Purchaser, issue a remarketing notice in the form attached to Exhibit G-1 or Exhibit G-2, as applicable, use Commercially Reasonable Efforts, to the extent permitted in the Prepaid Agreement, to arrange for the sale of such quantities by Prepay LLC (A) to another.

Municipal Utility, or (B) if necessary, to another purchaser; provided that any remarketing notice issued under clause (iii) above shall constitute a Structural Remarketing Notice (as defined in the Prepaid Agreement) and shall be subject to the requirements set forth in the Prepaid Agreement. Purchaser shall remain obligated to pay Issuer the Contract Price for any portion of the Contract Quantity for which it requests remarketing pursuant to this Section 7.3, provided that, if Issuer succeeds in arranging such a sale by Prepay LLC, Issuer shall credit against the amount owed by Purchaser for such Contract Quantities the amount received by Issuer from Prepay LLC for such sales less all directly incurred costs or expenses, including but not limited to remarketing administrative charges paid to Prepay LLC under the Prepaid Agreement, but in no event shall the amount of such credit be more than the Contract Price.

Section 7.4 Qualifying Use. Without limiting Purchaser’s other obligations under this Article VII, Purchaser agrees that, subject to Section 7.5, it will use all of the Commodities purchased under this Agreement in compliance with the Qualifying Use Requirements. Purchaser agrees that it will provide such additional information, records and certificates as Issuer may reasonably request to confirm Purchaser’s compliance with this Section 7.4.

Section 7.5 Remediation. The Parties acknowledge that Purchaser may at times need to remarket, or inadvertently remarket, Commodities received hereunder in a manner that does not comply with Qualifying Use Requirements due to daily and hourly fluctuations in Purchaser’s Commodity needs. To the extent Purchaser does so, Purchaser shall (a) exercise commercially Reasonable Efforts to use any Disqualified Sale Proceeds of such remarketing to purchase Commodities (other than Prior Commodities) that Purchaser uses in compliance with Qualifying Use Requirements and (b) reserve funds in an amount equal to any Disqualified Sale Proceeds until such Disqualified Sale Proceeds are remediated or transferred to the Trustee pursuant to Section 7.6(c) below.

Section 7.6 Semi-Annual Report: Ledger Entries; Redemption.

(a) To track compliance with the requirements of Section 7.5, Purchaser will provide a semi-annual report to Issuer (delivered not later than the fifteenth (15th) day of each April and October until the end of the Delivery Period) showing the following (each a “Semi-Annual Report”): the total quantity of proceeds from sales of Commodities received hereunder that (i) were sold by Purchaser to any Person other than a Municipal Utility and (ii) have not been remediated by Purchaser by applying such proceeds to purchase Gas or Electricity that is used in compliance with the Qualifying Use Requirements (such portion as units, “Disqualified Sale Units” and such portion as value received, “Disqualified Sale Proceeds”);

(b) Issuer will cause such unremediated Disqualified Sale Proceeds and the associated Disqualified Sale Units to be added to the appropriate remarketing ledgers maintained by Prepay LLC under the Prepaid Agreement, with the ledgers entries dated as of the end of the first month of the relevant six (6) Month period; and

(c) Purchaser shall transfer (to the extent such unremediated Disqualified Sales Proceeds and associated Disqualified Sale Units remain reflected on the appropriate remarketing ledgers under Section 7.6(a) at the time such transfer is required by this Section 7.6(c)) any such unremediated Disqualified Sale Proceeds and any other required funds (i.e., all additional funds

(a) No later than the 7th day of each Month during the Delivery Period (excluding the first Month of the Delivery Period) and the first Month following the end of the Delivery Period, Purchaser shall deliver to Issuer a statement (a “Purchaser’s Statement”) listing (i) for each purchase of Replacement Gas or Replacement Electricity, the quantity and replacement price applicable to such purchase, and (ii) any other amounts due to Purchaser in connection with this Agreement with respect to the prior Month(s).

(b) No later than the 12th day of each Month during the Delivery Period (excluding the first Month of the Delivery Period) and the first Month following the end of the Delivery Period (the “Billing Date”), Issuer shall deliver a statement (a “Billing Statement”) to Purchaser indicating (i) the total amount due to Issuer for Commodities delivered in the prior Month, (ii) any other amounts due to Issuer or Purchaser in connection with this Agreement with respect to the prior Month(s), and (iii) the net amount due to Issuer or Purchaser. If the actual quantity delivered is not known by the Billing Date, Issuer may provisionally prepare a Billing Statement based on Issuer’s best available knowledge of the quantity of Commodities delivered, which shall not exceed the sum of the Contract Quantity of all the Gas Days or Hours (as applicable) in such Month plus any make-up quantities delivered during such Month. The invoiced quantity and amounts paid thereon (with interest calculated on the amount overpaid or underpaid by Purchaser at the Default Rate) will then be adjusted on the following Month’s Billing Statement, as actual delivery information becomes available based on the actual quantity delivered.

(c) Upon request by either Party, the other Party shall deliver such supporting documentation of the foregoing as such requesting Party may reasonably request.

Section 14.2 Payment.

(a) If the Billing Statement indicates an amount due from Purchaser, then Purchaser shall remit such amount to the Trustee for the benefit of Issuer by wire transfer (pursuant
<!-- Page 317 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

**Section 14.3 Payment of Disputed Amounts.** If Purchaser disputes any amounts included in Issuer’s Billing Statement, Purchaser shall (except in the case of manifest error) nonetheless pay any amount required by the Billing Statement in accordance with Section 14.2 without regard to any right of set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or other defenses to payment that Purchaser may have; provided, however, that Purchaser shall have the right, after payment, to dispute any amounts included in a Billing Statement or otherwise used to calculate amounts due under Section 14.5. If Issuer disputes any amounts included in the Purchaser’s Statement, Issuer may withhold payment to the extent of the disputed amount; provided, however, that interest shall be due at the Default Rate for any withheld amount later found to have been properly due.

**Section 14.4 Late Payment.** If Purchaser fails to remit the full amount payable within one Business Day of when due, interest on the unpaid portion shall accrue from the date due until the date of payment at the Default Rate.

**Section 14.5 Audit; Adjustments.**

(a) A Party shall have the right, at its own expense, upon reasonable notice to the other Party and at reasonable times, to examine and audit and to obtain copies of the relevant portion of the books, records, and telephone recordings of the other Party to the extent reasonably necessary, but only to such extent, to verify the accuracy of any statement, charge, payment, or computation made under this Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any such examination and audit reveals any material discrepancy in the other Party’s books and records, the examining Party shall have a right to be reimbursed by the other Party for costs reasonably incurred in connection with such examination and audit. This right to examine, audit, and obtain copies shall not be available with respect to proprietary information not directly relevant to transactions under this Agreement.

(b) Each Purchaser’s Statement and each Billing Statement shall be conclusively presumed final and accurate and all associated claims for under- or overpayments shall be deemed waived unless such Purchaser’s Statement or Billing Statement is objected to in 28.
<!-- Page 318 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

writing, with adequate explanation and/or documentation, within two (2) years after the applicable Month of Commodity delivery.

(c) All retroactive adjustments shall be paid in full by the Party owing payment within 30 days of notice and substantiation of such inaccuracy. If the Parties are unable to agree upon any retroactive adjustments requested by either Party within the time period specified in Section 14.5(b), then either Party may pursue any remedies available with respect to such adjustments at law or in equity. Retroactive adjustments for payments made based on incorrect Billing Statement(s) shall bear interest at the Default Rate from the date such payment was made.

Section 14.6 Netting: No Set-Off. The Parties shall net all amounts due and owing, including any past due amounts (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall include any accrued interest), arising under this Agreement such that the Party owing the greater amount shall make a single payment of the net amount to the other Party in accordance with this Article XIV. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment for all amounts set forth in a Billing Statement provided to Purchaser shall be made without set-off or counterclaim of any kind.

Section 14.7 Source of Purchaser’s Payments. Purchaser covenants and agrees to make payments due hereunder from Utility Revenues, and only from such Utility Revenues, as an operating expense of its utility system or an Energy Payment (as defined in Section 14.9); provided, however, that Purchaser may apply any legally available monies to the payment of amounts due hereunder.

Section 14.8 Rate Covenant. Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees that it will establish, fix, prescribe, maintain, and collect rates, fees, and charges from the customers of its utility system so as to provide Utility Revenues sufficient to enable Purchaser to pay any other amounts legally payable from Utility Revenues, and to maintain any required reserves for Purchaser’s utility system. Purchaser further covenants and agrees that it shall not furnish or supply services free of charge to any Person, except any such service free of charge that Purchaser is supplying on the date hereof as has been specifically identified by Purchaser to Issuer in writing, and it shall promptly enforce the payment of any and all accounts owing to Purchaser for the sale of Commodities or the provision of distribution or other services to its customers. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be obligated to make any payments hereunder except from Utility Revenues.

Section 14.9 Pledge of Utility Revenues. Purchaser shall not grant any lien on or security interest in, or otherwise pledge or encumber, the Utility Revenues if the terms or effect of such lien, pledge or other encumbrance results in such lien, pledge or other encumbrance having priority over the obligations of Purchaser to pay the Contract Price for its Contract Quantities hereunder, which obligations constitute operating expenses or Energy Payments (as such term is defined in Purchaser’s Resolution No. 6649, adopted January 7, 1971, as amended and supplemented through May 18, 2024) of Purchaser.

Aron, to the extent it accepts such assignment, will deliver Assigned Product it receives from such Assigned Rights and Obligations to Issuer under the Prepaid Agreement, and Issuer will deliver such Assigned Product to Purchaser under this Agreement; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any such assignment shall constitute a partial assignment and delegation. Any such assignments must be proposed and agreed pursuant to Exhibit H and the Prepaid Agreement. To the extent so assigned, Issuer’s obligation to deliver, and Purchaser’s obligation to receive, the Hourly Quantity shall be reduced in accordance with Exhibit H to reflect the Assigned Product acquired by Issuer pursuant to such assignment.

**Section 15.2 Early Termination of Assignment Period.** Except for any Assignment Period that terminates contemporaneously with this Agreement, upon termination for any reason of the Assignment Period for any PPA Assignment Agreement, all reductions that have been made under Exhibit H to the Hourly Quantity shall be increased for all future periods to reverse any reductions to the Hourly Quantity made in connection with such PPA Assignment Agreement.

Pursuant to the terms of the Bond Indenture, Issuer has irrevocably appointed the Trustee as its agent to issue notices and as directed under the Bond Indenture, to take any other actions that Issuer is required or permitted to take under this Agreement.

<!-- Page 326 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Proposed by a Party (to the extent that any waiver in Section 18.16(b) below is unenforceable or ineffective as to such Party), a non-party or FERC acting sua sponte, shall solely be the "public interest" application of the "just and reasonable" standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956) and Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348 (1956) and clarified by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish, 554 U.S. 527 (2008).**

(b) In addition, and notwithstanding Section 18.16(a), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party, for itself and its successors and assigns, hereby expressly and irrevocably waives any rights it can or may have, now or in the future, under Section 205 and/or 206 of the Federal Power Act or otherwise, to seek to obtain from FERC by any means, directly or indirectly (through complaint, investigation or otherwise), and each hereby covenants and agrees not at any time to seek to so obtain, an order from FERC changing any section of this Agreement specifying the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition agreed to by the Parties, it being the express intent of the Parties that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, neither Party shall unilaterally seek to obtain from FERC any relief changing the rate, charge, classification, or other term or condition of this Agreement, notwithstanding any subsequent changes in applicable Law or market conditions that may occur. In the event it were to be determined that applicable Law precludes the Parties from waiving their rights to seek changes from FERC to their market-based power sales contracts (including entering into covenants not to do so) then this Section 18.16(b) shall not apply; provided that, consistent with Section 18.16(a), neither Party shall seek any such changes except solely under the "public interest" application of the "just and reasonable" standard of review and otherwise as set forth in Section 18.16(a).

**IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have caused this Amended & Restated Commodity Supply Contract to be duly executed and delivered by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the date first above written.**

[___], 2024

This Federal Tax Certificate is executed in connection with the Amended & Restated Commodity Supply Contract dated as of [___], 2024 (the “Supply Contract”), by and between Northern California Energy Authority (“Issuer”) and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“Purchaser”). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Supply Contract, in the Tax Certificate and Agreement, or in the Bond Indenture.

WHEREAS Purchaser acknowledges that Issuer is issuing the Bonds to fund the prepayment price under the Prepaid Agreement; and

WHEREAS the Bonds are intended to qualify for tax exemption under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and

WHEREAS Purchaser’s use of Commodities acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract and certain funds and accounts of Purchaser will affect the Bonds’ qualification for such tax exemption.

NOW, THEREFORE, PURCHASER HEREBY CERTIFIES AS FOLLOWS:

1. Purchaser is a municipal utility district created and existing pursuant to the provisions of organized under the provisions of the Municipal Utility District Act (Division 6, Chapter 2, Articles 2 and 3, Sections 11581 through 11614 of the California Public Utilities Code, as amended).

2. Purchaser will resell Electricity acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract and use all Gas acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract to generate Electricity that is resold, in each case, to its retail Electricity customers within its service area, with retail sales in all cases being made pursuant to regularly established and generally applicable tariffs or under authorized requirements contracts. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the term “service area” means (x) the area throughout which Purchaser provided Electricity transmission or distribution service at all times during the 5-year period ending on [December 31, 2023], and from then until the date of issuance of the Bonds (the “Closing Date”), and (y) any area recognized as the service area of Purchaser under state or federal law.

3. The annual average amount during the testing period of Gas purchased (other than for resale) used by Purchaser to generate Electricity that is purchased (other than for resale) by customers of Purchaser who are located within the service area of Purchaser is [_____] MMBtu. The maximum annual amount of Gas in any year being acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract is [_____] MMBtu. The annual average amount of Gas that Purchaser holds in storage as of the Closing Date is [_____] MMBtu. The annual average amount of Gas that Purchaser otherwise has a right to acquire as of the Closing Date is [_____] MMBtu. The sum of (a) the maximum amount of Gas in any year being acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract, (b) the annual average amount of Gas which Purchaser holds in storage, and (c) the amount of Gas which Purchaser otherwise has a right to acquire in the year described in the foregoing clause (a) is D-1
<!-- Page 333 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

[_____] MMBtu. Accordingly, the amount of Gas to be acquired under the Supply Contract by Purchaser, supplemented by the amount of Gas otherwise available to Purchaser as of the Closing Date, during any year does not exceed the sum of (i) [__]% of the annual average amount during the testing period of Gas purchased to generate Electricity that is purchased (other than for resale) by customers of Purchaser who are located within the service area of Purchaser; and (ii) the amount of Gas to be used to transport the prepaid Gas to Purchaser during such year. For purposes of this paragraph 3, the term "testing period" means the 5 calendar years ending [December 31, 2023], and the term "service area" means (x) the area throughout which Purchaser provided Gas distribution service at all times during the testing period, (y) any area within a county contiguous to the area described in (x) in which retail customers of Purchaser are located if such area is not also served by another utility providing Gas services, and (z) any area recognized as the service area of Purchaser under state or federal law.

4. Purchaser expects to pay for Gas acquired pursuant to the Supply Contract solely from funds derived from its Electricity distribution operations. Purchaser expects to use current net revenues of its to pay for current Gas acquisitions. There are no funds or accounts of Purchaser or any person who is a Related Person to Purchaser in which monies are invested and which are reasonably expected to be used to pay for Gas acquired more than one year after it is acquired. No portion of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used directly or indirectly to replace funds of Purchaser or any persons who are Related Persons to Purchaser that are or were intended to be used for the purpose for which the Bonds were issued.

5. The authorization, execution and delivery of the Supply Contract and compliance with the provisions thereof (a) will not conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under, (i) any instrument relating to the organization, existence or operation of Purchaser, (ii) any ruling, regulation, ordinance, judgment, order or decree to which Purchaser (or any of its officers in their respective capacities as such) is subject or (iii) any provision of the laws of the State relating to Purchaser and its affairs, and (b) to our knowledge will not result in, or require the creation or imposition of, any lien on any of the properties or revenues of Purchaser pursuant to any of the foregoing.

6. Purchaser is not in breach of or default under any applicable constitutional provision or any law or administrative regulation of the State or the United States or any applicable judgment or decree or, to our knowledge, any loan or other agreement, resolution, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument to which Purchaser is a party or to which Purchaser or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject, and to our knowledge no event has occurred and is continuing which with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default or event of default under any such instrument.

7. Payments to be made by Purchaser under the Supply Contract shall constitute operating expenses of Purchaser's utility system payable solely from the revenues and other available funds of Purchaser's utility system as a cost of purchased gas. The application of the revenues and other available funds of Purchaser's utility system to make such payments is not subject to any prior lien, encumbrance or other restriction.

**5.2** Each Relevant Party acknowledges that the Scheduling Entities may not have immediate access to Gas flow information at the Delivery Points. Therefore, the Scheduling Entities will closely monitor the available nomination information at the Delivery Points and promptly notify each other upon obtaining knowledge of any discrepancies in such nomination information and the quantities required to be delivered and taken under the applicable Gas Contracts at the Delivery Points. Each Relevant Party acknowledges and agrees that the inability of a Relevant Party to immediately access Gas flow information at the Delivery Points shall not impact or be construed as a waiver of any of the rights and obligations of the Relevant Parties set forth in the applicable Gas Contract.

or (iii) when actually received if delivered by courier or personal delivery (including overnight delivery service). Each Relevant Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the other Relevant Parties, to change its address at any time, and to designate that copies of all such notices be directed to another Person at another address. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Relevant Party may at any time notify the others that any notice, demand, request or communication to it must be provided by email transmission for a specified period of time or until further notice, and any communications delivered by means other than email transmission during such time shall be ineffective.

7. NO IMPACT ON CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  
Except as expressly set forth herein or in an applicable Gas Contract, nothing in this Communications Protocol nor any Relevant Party’s actions or inactions hereunder shall have any impact on any Relevant Party’s rights or obligations under the Gas Contracts.

8. UPSTREAM SUPPLY CONTRACT  
8.1 J. Aron and Participant may designate a contract as an “Upstream Supply Contract” by entering into an Assignment Agreement (as defined below) and notifying the other Relevant Parties of the execution of such Assignment Agreement; provided that (i) any such Upstream Supply Contract must include this Communications Protocol, (ii) any Upstream Supplier thereunder must be contract-enabled with J. Aron; (iii) any Upstream Supplier thereunder must be able to satisfy J. Aron’s internal requirements that are necessary to “know your customer” rules, policies and procedures, anti-money laundering rules and regulations, Dodd-Frank Act, Commodity Exchange Act, PATRIOT Act and similar rules, regulations, requirements and corresponding policies; (iv) any Upstream Supply Contract must have a delivery period of a minimum of two years; (v) any such Upstream Supplier, Participant and J. Aron must enter into a Limited Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Attachment 4 (an “Assignment Agreement”); and (vi) an Affiliate of Participant may only act as an Upstream Supplier (a) to the extent that it is acting as a replacement supplier due to the early termination of an Upstream Supply Contract and (b) for the remaining term for deliveries under such terminated Upstream Supply Contract.

8.2 Not later than 180 days prior to the expiration of any Upstream Supply Contract or immediately upon the early termination of any Upstream Supply Contract, J. Aron and Participant will begin to cooperate in good faith and exercise commercially reasonable efforts to locate a replacement Upstream Supply Contract. J. Aron agrees that it will not unreasonably delay or withhold its consent to any Upstream Supply Contract proposed by Participant, provided that it shall not be unreasonable for J. Aron to withhold its consent if the proposed Upstream Supply Contract or Upstream Supplier thereunder (i) fails to satisfy the requirements set forth in Section 8.1 above or (ii) poses materially different risks to J. Aron or the other Relevant Parties (other than Participant) relative to the Upstream Supply Contract and Upstream Supplier that is being replaced (without regard to any adverse changes relating to the Upstream Supplier being replaced that arose after such

G-1-5
<!-- Page 343 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Contract+Details)

8.3 If the Assigned Contract Price (as defined in any Assignment Agreement) is a fixed price, the Contract Quantity for each Gas Day under the Commodity Supply Contract (and the portion of the Contract Quantity associated therewith under the Prepaid Agreement and the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement) shall equal the (i) Contract Quantity for each Gas Day of the applicable Assignment Period (as defined in the relevant Assignment Agreement) multiplied by (ii) the result of (A) the relevant Assigned Contract Price, divided by (B) [NOTE: To list the result of the following formula as determined at pricing: Front End Fixed Price + (Active Swap Fee – Standby Swap Fee).]. For the avoidance of doubt, such updates to the Contract Quantities shall only apply for the relevant Assignment Period, and, in the event of an early termination of any such Assignment Period, such adjusted Contract Quantities shall be reversed effective as of the first day of the second Month following the Month in which such early termination occurs.

8.4 The declaration of “Force Majeure” by an Upstream Supplier under an Upstream Supply Contract shall be deemed Force Majeure for purposes of each of the Gas Contracts.

# EXHIBIT H
## ASSIGNMENT OF ASSIGNABLE CONTRACTS

1. **General Requirements.**

   1.1. During the Electricity Delivery Period, Assigned Rights and Obligations under a Assignable Contract may only be assigned under this Exhibit H if the following requirements are satisfied:

   1.1.1. The seller under such Assignable Contract (the “APC Party”) either (i) has a long-term senior unsecured credit rating that is “Baa3” or higher from Moody’s Investor’s Service, Inc. (or any successor to its credit rating service operation), “BBB-” or higher from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (or any successor to its credit rating service operation) or “A” or higher from Fitch Ratings, Inc. (or any successor to its credit rating service operation), (ii) provides alternative credit support that is reasonably satisfactory to J. Aron or (iii) otherwise provides evidence of its creditworthiness that is reasonably satisfactory to J. Aron;

   1.1.2. The APC Party can satisfy J. Aron’s internal requirements as they relate to “know your customer” rules, policies and procedures, anti-money laundering rules and regulations, Dodd-Frank Act, Commodity Exchange Act, Patriot Act and similar rules, regulations, requirements and corresponding policies;

   1.1.3. The APC Party is organized in the United States and in a jurisdiction that does not present material and adverse tax consequences to J. Aron or Issuer in connection with such proposed assignment, provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Issuer shall have an obligation to reimburse J. Aron for any adverse tax consequences that are not material;

   1.1.4. The Applicable Project (as defined below) is reasonably expected to be able to generate the P99 Generation (as defined below), as agreed by Purchaser and J. Aron; provided that, if Purchaser and J. Aron are unable to reach agreement after good faith discussions, then J. Aron shall make such determination in its sole discretion.

   1.1.5. J. Aron, Purchaser, and Issuer have agreed on and executed an Assignment Schedule for such assignment;

   1.1.6. J. Aron, Purchaser, Issuer, and the applicable APC Party have agreed on and executed an Assignment Agreement for such assignment;

   1.1.7. Any such Assignable Contract must terminate on or before the end of the Electricity Delivery Period; and

H-1
<!-- Page 376 -->
1.1.8. The contract price (in $/MWh) payable by Purchaser under the applicable Assignable Contract (the “APC Contract Price”) is a fixed price unless Issuer, Purchaser and J. Aron agree, each in their sole discretion, to appropriate changes to the relevant documents to accommodate a floating APC Contract Price. For purposes of this Exhibit H, a “fixed price” shall be deemed to include any price that is fixed but for a periodic escalation (whether pre-determined or by reference to a price index).

2. Proposed Assignment. Purchaser may propose an assignment under Article XV of the Commodity Supply Contract by delivering the following items to Issuer and to J. Aron:

2.1. A written notice of the proposed assignment signed by Purchaser;

2.2. A true and complete copy of the Assignable Contract under which such Assigned Rights and Obligations would arise;

2.3. Evidence reasonably satisfactory to Issuer and J. Aron that all authorizations, consents, approvals, licenses, rulings, permits, exemptions, variances, orders, judgments, decrees, declarations of or regulations by any Government Agency necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Assignable Contract and the assignment of the Assignable Contract to J. Aron have been obtained and are in full force and effect;

2.4. For any Assignable Contract to be assigned during the Electricity Delivery Period, a description and information regarding the applicable project to which the Assignable Contract applies (the “Applicable Project”), including but not limited to information on the location, interconnection(s), and operating history of Applicable Project;

2.5. For any Assignable Contract to be assigned during the Electricity Delivery Period, Purchaser shall deliver monthly historical generation and meteorological data of the Applicable Project dating back to the commercial operation date and, if readily available, a report from a nationally recognized consultant in the energy industry that is reasonably acceptable to Issuer and J. Aron showing the “P99” forecasted generation (“P99 Generation”); and

2.6. Such additional information as Issuer and J. Aron may reasonably request regarding the Assignable Contract and the APC Party.

Following Issuer’s and J. Aron’s receipt of such information, Purchaser and Issuer will, and Issuer will cause J. Aron to, (i) negotiate in good faith with one another regarding a potential Assignment Schedule, with the initial draft of such Assignment Schedule to be developed by J. Aron, and (ii) negotiate in good faith with one another and the APC Party regarding an Assignment Agreement, in each case related to the proposed assignment. If such Assignment Schedule and Assignment are agreed to by the representative parties thereto, the applicable parties will execute such Assignment Agreement and Assignment Schedule to be effective upon the assignment of the Assigned Rights and Obligations from Purchaser to J. Aron pursuant to the Assignment Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser acknowledges that J. Aron will not be required. 

H-2
<!-- Page 377 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

to execute any Assignment Agreement, Assignment Schedule, or otherwise accept any Assigned Rights and Obligations unless the APC Party (i) satisfies J. Aron’s internal requirements as they relate to “know your customer” rules, policies and procedures, anti-money laundering rules and regulations, Dodd-Frank Act, Commodity Exchange Act, Patriot Act and similar rules, regulations, requirements and corresponding policies, (ii) is organized in the United States, and (iii) satisfies all other requirements in Section 1 of this Exhibit H.

3. Assignment Schedule. In connection with each assignment, an “Assignment Schedule” will be prepared in the form attached hereto as Attachment 1 (with such changes as agreed by the Parties in their sole discretion), must be executed by Purchaser, Issuer and J. Aron, and must include each of the following:

3.1. The term of such Assigned Rights and Obligations (the “Assignment Period”) shall have the meaning specified in each applicable Assignment Agreement and shall (i) end not later than one (1) Month prior to the end of the current Reset Period, (ii) not commence any earlier than sixty (60) days after Purchaser’s original notice under Section 2.1 above, and (iii) have a primary term that does not exceed 12 Months in duration (provided, for the avoidance of doubt, the primary term references the term of the Assignment Period and not the term of a Assignable Contract). To the extent mutually agreed upon by all parties to the Assignment Schedule, the Assignment Period may include a month-to-month or annual renewal term that may be terminated upon written notice of termination 30 days prior to the end of any renewal term.

3.2. For any Assignable Contract to be assigned during the Electricity Delivery Period, a description of the Applicable Project or upstream supplier.

3.3. For any Assignable Contract to be assigned during the Electricity Delivery Period, the P99 Generation and P50 Generation of the Applicable Project and, if the Assigned Quantities that Purchaser wishes to include in the Assigned Rights and Obligations is less than the total P99 forecasted generation available from the Applicable Project, the Assigned Quantities as so limited. Purchaser and J. Aron shall in good faith attempt to agree upon the P99 Generation based on the information provided pursuant to Section 2.5 above; provided that, if Purchaser and J. Aron are unable to reach agreement, then J. Aron shall make such determination in its sole discretion.

3.4. The “Assigned Prepay Quantity” for each Month of the Assignment Period, which Assigned Prepay Quantity will be the lesser of (i) the P99 Generation of the Applicable Project for such Month, and (ii) the Assigned Quantities as described in Section 3.3 for such Month; provided that, in the case of clause (b), the Assigned Prepay Quantity for each Month may not exceed the limit expressed in the proviso to Section 3.5 below.

3.5. An updated Exhibit A to the Commodity Supply Contract reflecting a reduction in Hourly Quantity during the Assignment Period after giving effect to the Assignment Schedule (the “Reduced Hourly Quantity”), which Reduced Hourly
<!-- Page 378 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Quantity for each Delivery Hour will equal (i) the Assigned Prepay Quantity for such Delivery Hour (which will be determined by dividing the Assigned Prepay Quantity for the applicable Month by the number of Delivery Hours in such Month), multiplied by (ii) the result of (A) the APC Contract Price applicable for such Month, divided by (B) S[____]/MWh while deliveries are to the Primary Electricity Delivery Point; provided that, in each case, if the Reduced Hourly Quantity for any Month would result in a Contract Quantity of less than zero (0), then the Assigned Prepay Quantity for such Month will be reduced to the closest whole MWh, such that the Contract Quantity is not reduced below zero (0).

3.6. The APC Contract Price, which as set forth in Section 1.7 above must be a fixed price unless Issuer, Purchaser and J. Aron agree to appropriate changes to the relevant documents to accommodate a floating APC Contract Price.

3.7. The Assigned Delivery Point for all Assigned Electricity.

3.8. The APC Contract Price must be inclusive of all Assigned Products. Assigned Products may not include (i) capacity or (ii) any other products that are separately delivered from Electricity (during the Electricity Delivery Period) other than RECs whose delivery may be accomplished through the delivery of a certificate or reporting to an applicable tracking agency.

6 NTD: This amount will be the result of the following formula as determined at pricing: Front End Fixed Price + (Active Swap Fee – Standby Swap Fee).

**FORM OF ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT**

NOTE: To be attached to the Commodity Supply Contract and may be included as an exhibit to any new Commodity Supply Contract or PPA executed by the municipal utility (offtaker) along with this language to be added to the Commodity Supply Contract or PPA: “[Seller] agrees that [Buyer] may assign a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to J. Aron and Company, LLC (“J. Aron”) at any time upon not less than [___] days’ notice by delivering a written request for such assignment, which request must include a proposed assignment agreement in the form attached hereto as [Exhibit ___], with the blanks in such form completed in [Buyer’s] sole discretion. Provided that [Buyer] delivers a proposed assignment agreement complying with the previous sentence, [Seller] agrees to (i) comply with J. Aron’s reasonable requests for know-your-customer and similar account opening information and documentation with respect to [Seller], including but not limited to information related to forecasted generation, credit rating, and compliance with anti-money laundering rules, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, the PATRIOT Act and similar rules, regulations, requirements and corresponding policies; and (ii) promptly execute such assignment agreement and implement such assignment as contemplated thereby, subject only to the countersignature of J. Aron and Company, LLC and [Buyer].”

This Limited Assignment Agreement (this “Assignment Agreement” or “Agreement”) is entered into as of [___], by and among [___], a [___] (“PPA Seller”), [Municipal Participant], a [___] (“PPA Buyer”), and J. Aron & Company LLC, a New York limited liability company (“J. Aron”), and relates to that certain power purchase agreement between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller as further described in Appendix 1 (the “PPA”). Unless the context otherwise specifies or requires, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the PPA.

In consideration of the premises above and the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, PPA Seller, PPA Buyer and J. Aron (the “Parties” hereto; each is a “Party”) agree as follows:

1. Limited Assignment and Delegation.

   (a) PPA Buyer hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to J. Aron all right, title and interest in and to the rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA to receive delivery of the products described in Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Products”) during the Assignment Period (as defined in Appendix 1), as such rights may be limited or further described in the “Further Information” section on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Product Rights”). All Assigned Products shall be delivered pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the Assignment Period as provided in Appendix 1. All other rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly reserved for PPA Buyer.

   (b) PPA Buyer hereby delegates to J. Aron the obligation to pay for all Assigned Products that are actually delivered to J. Aron pursuant to the Assigned Product Rights during the Assignment Period (the “Delivered Product Payment Obligation” and together with the Assigned Product Rights, collectively the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”); provided that (i) all other obligations of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly retained by PPA Buyer and PPA Buyer shall be solely responsible for any amounts due to PPA Seller that are not directly related to Assigned Products; and (ii) the Parties acknowledge and agree that PPA Seller will only be obligated to deliver a single consolidated invoice during the Assignment Period (with a copy to J. Aron).
<!-- Page 381 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

1. **Assignment of Rights and Obligations.**

   (c) J. Aron hereby accepts and PPA Seller hereby consents and agrees to the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delegation described in clauses (a) and (b) above.

   (d) All scheduling of Assigned Products and other communications related to the PPA shall take place pursuant to the terms of the PPA; provided that (i) title to Assigned Product will pass from PPA Seller to J. Aron upon delivery by PPA Seller of Assigned Product in accordance with the PPA; (ii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any Notice of a Force Majeure Event or Event of Default or default, breach or other occurrence that, if not cured within the applicable grace period, could result in an Event of Default contemporaneously upon delivery thereof to PPA Seller and promptly after receipt thereof from PPA Seller; (iii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any forecasts of Energy generation provided by PPA Seller under the PPA; (iv) PPA Seller will provide copies to J. Aron of all invoices and supporting data provided to PPA Buyer pursuant to Section [ ], provided that any payment adjustments or subsequent reconciliations occurring after the date that is 10 days prior to the payment due date for a monthly invoice, including pursuant to Section [ ], will be resolved solely between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller and therefore PPA Seller will not be obligated to deliver copies of any communications relating thereto to J. Aron; and (v) PPA Buyer and PPA Seller, as applicable, will provide copies to J. Aron of any other information reasonably requested by J. Aron relating to Assigned Products.

   (e) PPA Seller acknowledges that (i) J. Aron intends to immediately transfer title to any Assigned Products received from PPA Seller through one or more intermediaries such that all Assigned Products will be re-delivered to PPA Buyer; and (ii) in the event that PPA Buyer fails to pay the relevant intermediary entity for any such Assigned Products, the receivables owed by PPA Buyer for such Assigned Products (“PPA Buyer Receivables”) may be transferred to J. Aron. To the extent any such PPA Buyer Receivables are transferred to J. Aron, J. Aron may transfer such PPA Buyer Receivables to PPA Seller and apply the face amount thereof as a reduction to any Delivered Product Payment Obligation. To effect such transfer, J. Aron shall deliver to PPA Seller a notice of intent to transfer PPA Buyer Receivables not later than the payment due date for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation and shall deliver to PPA Seller a bill of sale signed by J. Aron not later than five Business Days thereafter. Thereafter, PPA Seller shall be entitled to pursue collection on such PPA Buyer Receivables directly against PPA Buyer.

   (f) The Assigned Prepay Quantity set forth in Appendix 2 relates to obligations by and between J. Aron and PPA Buyer and has no impact on PPA Seller’s rights and obligations under the PPA.

2. **Assignment Early Termination.**

   (a) The Assignment Period may be terminated early upon the occurrence of any of the following:

   (1) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by either J. Aron or PPA Buyer to each of the other Parties;
<!-- Page 382 -->
(2) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by PPA Seller to each of J. Aron and PPA Buyer following J. Aron’s failure to pay when due any amounts owed to PPA Seller in respect of any Delivered Product Payment Obligation and such payment is not made by J. Aron within five (5) business days following receipt by J. Aron and PPA Buyer of written notice;

(3) delivery of a written notice by PPA Seller if any of the events described in the definition of [Bankrupt] in the PPA occurs with respect to J. Aron; or

(4) delivery of a written notice by J. Aron if any of the events described in the definition of [Bankrupt] [John: Some of the PPAs I just reviewed called this Bankruptcy Event, bracketing for future.] in the PPA occurs with respect to PPA Seller.

(b) The Assignment Period will end at the end of last delivery hour on the date specified in the termination notice provided pursuant to Section 2(a), which date shall not be earlier than the end of the last day of the calendar month in which such notice is delivered if termination is pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) or 2(a)(2) above. All Assigned Rights and Obligations shall revert from J. Aron to PPA Buyer upon the early termination of the Assignment Period, provided that (i) J. Aron shall remain responsible for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation with respect to any Assigned Product delivered to J. Aron prior to the end of the Assignment Period, and (ii) any legal restrictions on the effectiveness of such reversion (whether arising under bankruptcy law or otherwise) shall not affect the expiration or early termination of the Assignment Period

(c) The Assignment Period will automatically terminate upon the expiration of any termination of the PPA. All Assigned Rights and Obligations shall revert from J. Aron to PPA Buyer upon the expiration of or early termination of the PPA, provided that (i) J. Aron shall remain responsible for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation with respect to any Assigned Product delivered to J. Aron prior to the end of the Assignment Period, and (ii) any legal restrictions on the effectiveness of such reversion (whether arising under bankruptcy law or otherwise) shall not affect the expiration or early termination of the Assignment Period.

Aron that (a) the PPA is in full force and effect; (b) no event or circumstance exists (or would exist with the passage of time or the giving of notice) that would give either of them the right to terminate the PPA or suspend performance thereunder; and (c) all of its obligations under the PPA required to be performed on or before the Assignment Period Start Date have been fulfilled.

4. Notices. Any notice, demand, or request required or authorized by this Assignment Agreement to be given by one Party to another Party shall be delivered in accordance with [Article]/[Section] [__] of the PPA and to the addresses of each PPA Seller and PPA Buyer specified in the PPA.

![Exhibit A](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Exhibit+A)

The Calculation Agent will undertake the following steps in determining the Available Discount Percentage for any Reset Period (each, a “New Reset Period”):

- **Step 1: Determine the “Prior Remaining Commodity Value”**
  - The Calculation Agent will determine the Remaining Commodity Value for the last month of the current Reset Period (the “Old Reset Period”) based on Attachment 1 hereto, as such Attachment 1 initially existed or was last updated at the beginning of the prior Reset Period (the “Prior Remaining Commodity Value”).
  - “Remaining Commodity Value” means, for any month, the amount set forth on Attachment 1 of the Exhibit A as the “Remaining Commodity Value” for such month, as Attachment 1 may be updated pursuant to this Exhibit A in connection with the establishment of any new Reset Period.

- **Step 2: The Calculation Agent will specify the length of the New Reset Period pursuant to Section 3 of the Agreement**

- **Step 3: The Calculation Agent will specify a Reset Period Implied Rate for the New Reset Period and a Delivery Period Implied Rate**
  - “Reset Period Implied Rate” means, for any Reset Period other than the Current Reset Period, a fixed rate offered by the Funding Recipient for such Reset Period as of the Bond Pricing Date for such Reset Period, which rate the Parties acknowledge (i) will be determined by Funding Recipient in its sole and absolute discretion based on the rate of Funding Recipient, and (ii) for which the Funding Recipient may consider all relevant factors, including (w) the nature of the source of funding provided by the Funding Agreement, including any applicable regulatory or capital charges, (x) the tenor, (y) market interest for such funding at the time, and (z) any other unique attributes of the Funding Agreement funding relative to other sources available to Funding Recipient. The Parties acknowledge that, for purposes of providing an Estimated Available Discount Percentage, the Calculation Agent may rely on indicative pricing proposals from a Qualified Funding Recipient.
  - “Delivery Period Implied Rate” means, for any remaining portion of the Delivery Period that is not covered by a Reset Period, a fixed rate determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole and absolute discretion as of the Bond Pricing Date for such Reset Period which the Calculation Agent determines (in its sole discretion) that Funding Recipient would be able to acquire, as of the date of determination, funding from other sources comparable to the funding provided by the Funding Agreement as of the date of determination if such Funding Agreement were extended for the entire Delivery Period. In determining such a rate, and the Calculation Agent may consider all relevant factors, including (w) the nature of the source of funding provided by the 

Exhibit A – Page 1
<!-- Page 396 -->
![Funding Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Funding+Agreement)

- **Step 4: Determine the “New Remaining Delivery Cost”**
  - The Calculation Agent will determine the “Remaining Delivery Cost” for each month of the Delivery Period after the Old Reset Period. The Remaining Delivery Cost for the first month of the New Reset Period is the “New Remaining Delivery Cost”.
  - “Remaining Delivery Cost” means, for any determination month, an amount calculated by the Calculation Agent equal to the net present value of a stream of monthly payments equal to the Monthly Contract Quantities multiplied by the applicable Fixed Price (as defined in the Prepaid Agreement) for the remainder of the Delivery Period (including such determination month), Discount Percentage at the Reset Period Implied Rate for the New Reset Period and the Delivery Period Implied Rate for the remainder of the Delivery Period after the New Reset Period.

- **Step 5: Additional Reduction Amount or Changing Monthly Contract Quantities**
  - If the Prior Remaining Commodity Value is less than the New Remaining Delivery Cost:
    - If the Reset Period will go to the end of the Delivery Period, the Calculation Agent will reduce the Monthly Contract Quantities to zero in as many months as necessary at the end of the Delivery Period (and, to the extent necessary, reduce the Monthly Contract Quantities in the last remaining month of the Reset Period to a quantity greater than zero) such that the Prior Remaining Commodity Value is equal to the New Remaining Delivery Cost.
    - If the Reset Period will end prior to the Delivery Period, the Calculation Agent may reduce the Monthly Contract Quantities as provided above to the extent such reduction results in a greater Available Discount Percentage for such Reset Period.
  - If the Prior Remaining Commodity Value is greater than the New Remaining Delivery Cost:
    - Subject to the following bullet, the Calculation Agent will pay to the Issuer the amount, if any, by which (A) the Prior Remaining Commodity Value exceeds (B) the New Remaining Delivery Cost (the “Additional Reduction Amount”) on the first day of the contemplated Interest Rate Period, which payment shall be applied by the Issuer to the retirement of Bonds.
    - Notwithstanding the prior bullet, the Calculation Agent shall elect to retain a portion of the Excess Amount to the extent (i) the Reset Period will end prior to the Delivery Period, (ii) such retention results in a greater Available Discount Percentage, and (iii) doing so is.
<!-- Page 397 -->
![Exhibit A – Page 3](attachment://exhibit-a-page-3.png)

- consistent with the amortization requirement of the Bonds. If the Calculation Agent elects to retain a portion of such Excess Amount pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the Additional Reduction Amount shall be the portion of such Excess Amount that the Calculation Agent elects to pay.
  - Any Additional Reduction Amount or changes in Monthly Contract Quantities will then be included in calculating the New Remaining Delivery Cost. An Additional Reduction Amount will reduce the Prior Remaining Commodity Value for this purpose.
  - The Calculation Agent will amend Attachment 1 hereto effective as of the beginning of the New Reset Period such that the Remaining Commodity Value for each month in the New Reset Period and the remainder of the Delivery Period is equal to the Remaining Delivery Cost for such month as determined under Step 4 and updated under this Step 5.

- **Step 6: Determine the Fixed Rate for the Bonds for the term of such contemplated Interest Rate Period**
  - The remarketing agent or underwriter of the Bonds for such contemplated Interest Rate Period will specify the Fixed Rate.
  - “Fixed Rate” means, for any New Reset Period, the fixed rate or rates of interest payable by the Issuer with respect to a Series of Bonds or, in the case of a Series of Variable Rate Bonds (as defined in the Bond Indenture), the fixed rate payable by the Issuer under the related fixed rate swap transaction, which Fixed Rates will be determined on the Bond Pricing Date at a rate sufficient to enable all the Bonds to be sold or remarketed on such Bond Pricing Date in accordance with the Bond Indenture (which sale price may include a premium or Discount Percentage to par), as determined based on market information then available.

- **Step 7: Determine Monthly Discount Percentage Portion of Available Discount Percentage**
  - The Calculation Agent will determine the Monthly Discount Percentage portion of the Available Discount Percentage for each portion of the Reset Period based on the expected differences between monthly revenues and monthly debt service and other obligations of the Commodity Project (as defined in the Bond Indenture).

- **Step 8: Determine Annual Refund Portion of Available Discount Percentage**
  - The Calculation Agent and Issuer shall mutually agree upon the projected Annual Refund (as defined in the Commodity Supply Contracts) for the Reset Period, which shall be determined consistent with the Commodity Supply Contracts and shall be the remaining portion of the Available Discount Percentage.

![Termination Exercise Notice](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Termination+Exercise+Notice)

Termination Exercise Notice shall not prevent the designation or occurrence of an Early Termination Date that is earlier than the last day of the then-current Reset Period if an Event of Default or a Termination Event occurs that is subject to a shorter notice period.

For purposes of this Part 1(d), the Affected Parties are identified below:

For the avoidance of doubt, the identification of Affected Parties for any Additional Termination Event is made solely for the purpose of determining the party entitled to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(a) or Section 6(b) of the Agreement. Part 1(d)(i), Part 1(d)(vii) and Part 1(d)(viii) are not listed above because the Early Termination Date will be established automatically upon the occurrence of the events therein described.

(e) Early Termination. The following shall apply with respect to early termination under Section 6:

(i) Section 6(a) is hereby amended by deleting the reference to “20 days” in the third line thereof and replacing it with “60 days”.

(ii) The “Automatic Early Termination” provision of Section 6(a) will not apply to Issuer and will not apply to Counterparty.

(iii) Transfer to Avoid Termination Event.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

(vi) Payments on Early Termination. Section 6(e) of the Agreement is deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following:

“(e) Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, each party will pay to the other party any Unpaid Amounts due to such other party (subject to any netting pursuant to Section 2(c)) (the “Early Termination Amount”), and NO OTHER AMOUNTS SHALL BE PAYABLE BY EITHER PARTY.

WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO PAYMENTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE BY EITHER PARTY OR HAVE FALLEN DUE IN RESPECT OF A TRANSACTION GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EARLY TERMINATION DATE IN RESPECT OF THAT TRANSACTION AND WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS SECTION 6(e) WITH RESPECT TO THE OBLIGATIONS TO PAY UNPAID AMOUNTS, THE PARTIES AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT:

(i) THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE ANY PAYMENT UNDER THAT TRANSACTION ARE CONDITIONAL UPON SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE NOT HAVING OCCURRED ON OR BEFORE THE DATE SPECIFIED FOR THAT PAYMENT PURSUANT TO THE CONFIRMATION EVIDENCING THAT TRANSACTION AND NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO MAKE THAT PAYMENT IF, ON OR BEFORE THE DATE SPECIFIED FOR THAT PAYMENT, SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE HAS OCCURRED;

(ii) EACH PARTY’S RIGHT TO RECEIVE ANY PAYMENTS UNDER THAT TRANSACTION IS INDEPENDENT OF ITS RIGHT TO RECEIVE ANY PAYMENTS WHICH HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN MADE, OR WHICH HAVE FALLEN DUE, UNDER THAT TRANSACTION BEFORE THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE AND A PARTY’S ENTITLEMENT TO RECEIVE SUBSEQUENT PAYMENTS IS NOT UNCONDITIONALLY EARNED BY THE MAKING OF ANY PREVIOUS PAYMENTS PRIOR TO THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE;

(iii) IT SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY TO ENSURE THAT ITS ACCOUNTING, REGULATORY AND ALL OTHER TREATMENTS OF THAT TRANSACTION ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CONDITIONAL NATURE OF ITS ENTITLEMENT TO RECEIVE ANY PAYMENT UNDER THAT TRANSACTION; AND

(iv) THAT TRANSACTION HAS BEEN EXECUTED UNDER MATERIALLY DIFFERENT TERMS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PRICING) FROM THAT WHICH WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR A TRANSACTION WHERE THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES WERE NOT SUBJECT TO THE EARLY TERMINATION PROVISIONS (AS SET FORTH HEREIN).
<!-- Page 417 -->
The parties agree and acknowledge that they are party to other agreements containing provisions, when analyzed together with the provisions in this Agreement regarding the consequences of the occurrence of such Early Termination Date (the “Early Termination Provisions”), provide a commercial incentive to agree to those Early Termination Provisions.

(vii) “Termination Currency” means United States Dollars.

(viii) The definition of “Unpaid Amounts” shall be amended and restated as follows:

“Unpaid Amounts” owing to any party means, with respect to an Early Termination Date, the aggregate of (a) in respect of all Terminated Transactions, the amounts that became payable (or that would have become payable but for Section 2(a)(iii)) to such party under Section 2(a)(i) on or prior to such Early Termination Date and which remain unpaid as of such Early Termination Date, and (b) in respect of each Terminated Transaction, (i) for any Determination Period (as defined in the Confirmation for such Terminated Transaction) under such Terminated Transaction (A) that has ended prior to such day and (B) for which the Scheduled Settlement Date for such Terminated Transaction has not yet occurred, the amount that would be payable with respect to such Determination Period on the Scheduled Settlement Date therefor, and (ii) for the Determination Period in which the Early Termination Date occurs, a prorated portion of the payment that would be payable on the Scheduled Settlement Date for such Determination Period prior to and including such day relative to the total number of days in such Determination Period.

(f) Limitation on Termination Rights. Notwithstanding anything in Section 6 of this Agreement to the contrary, Issuer and Counterparty shall have no right to designate, and shall not designate, an Early Termination Date for any Termination Events or Events of Default other than those specified in Section 5(a)(iii) [Credit Support Default, Section 5(a)(vii) [Bankruptcy] and Part 1(d) [Additional Termination Events], provided that Issuer and Counterparty as applicable may pursue any equitable remedies available to them in the case of any other Events of Default or Termination Events.

(g) Assignment of Any Right to Termination Payment Other than Unpaid Amounts.

(i) The parties acknowledge that the terms of the Seller Swap do not entitle Counterparty to any payments in respect of any termination of the Seller Swap other than for “Unpaid Amounts” (as defined therein). Nonetheless, Counterparty hereby presently transfers and assigns to Issuer all of Counterparty’s right, title and interest to any payments and rights to receive payments that Counterparty receives or becomes entitled to receive in the future arising as a result of or otherwise in respect of any early termination of the Seller Swap, excluding only any right for Counterparty to receive Unpaid Amounts thereunder.

(ii) The parties further acknowledge that (A) the terms of the Seller Swap do not entitle Prepay LLC to any payments in respect of any termination of the Seller
<!-- Page 418 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

Swap other than for Unpaid Amounts (as defined therein) and (B) pursuant to the terms of the Prepaid Contract, Prepay LLC has assigned to Issuer all rights to any payments and rights to receive payments that Prepay LLC receives or becomes entitled to receive in the future arising as a result of or otherwise in respect of any early termination of the Seller Swap, excluding only any right for Prepay LLC to receive Unpaid Amounts (as defined in the Seller Swap) (any such payment under clause (B), excluding any such Unpaid Amounts, the “Seller Swap Payment”). As additional consideration hereunder, Issuer hereby transfers and assigns to Counterparty all of Issuer’s right, title, and interest to all payments and rights to receive payments, if any, that Issuer receives or becomes entitled to receive in the future arising as a result of or otherwise in respect of the Seller Swap Payment. Issuer agrees that it will not take any steps to enforce any right to receive any payments that it has assigned to Counterparty pursuant to this Part 1(g).

Section 7. SPE Custodian.

(a) The SPE Custodian shall have (i) no liability under any agreement other than this Custodial Agreement and (ii) no duty to inquire as to the provisions of any agreement other than this Custodial Agreement, the Funding Agreement, the Prepaid Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the J. Aron Subordinated Loans and the Back-End Commodity Swap; provided, however, that the SPE Custodian shall have no duties or responsibilities whatsoever except such duties and responsibilities as are specifically set forth in this Agreement. The SPE Custodian may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting upon any written notice, document, instruction or request furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The SPE Custodian shall be under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document, notice, instruction or request. The SPE Custodian shall have no duty to solicit any payments which may be due it. The SPE Custodian (in its capacity as SPE Custodian and Valuation Agent) shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in good faith except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the SPE Custodian’s gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of any loss to any party hereto. In connection with the execution of any of its powers or the performance of any of its duties hereunder, the SPE Custodian may consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled Persons selected and retained by it. The SPE Custodian shall not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted in good faith by it in accordance with the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or other skilled Persons, provided the SPE Custodian exercised due care and good faith in the selection of such Person. The permissive rights of the SPE Custodian to take actions enumerated under this Custodial Agreement shall not be construed as duties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Custodial Agreement, the Funding Agreement, the Prepaid Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the J. Aron Subordinated Loans and the Back-End Commodity Swap, the SPE Custodian shall not be required to exercise any rights or remedies under this Custodial Agreement or otherwise take any action or refrain from taking any action unless it shall have been directed to do so in a writing by Prepay LLC, Issuer or the Trustee which is authorized or permitted to be given under this Custodial Agreement. So long as the SPE Custodian has requested instructions from one or more of Prepay LLC, Issuer or the Trustee in a timely manner regarding a matter or determination for which such party has the right to provide instructions hereunder, the SPE Custodian shall not be liable for any delay in acting that is attributable to a delay or failure by Prepay LLC, Issuer or the Trustee in providing such instructions to the SPE Custodian, and the SPE Custodian shall be fully protected, and shall incur no liability whatsoever to Prepay LLC, Issuer, the Trustee, the Swap Counterparty or any other Person in connection with, in acting (or failing to act) pursuant to such instructions, provided that
<!-- Page 473 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
such instructions (i) are reasonably believed to have been given by an Authorized Officer and (ii) are authorized or permitted to be given under this Custodial Agreement. In the event that the SPE Custodian shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or demands from any party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the provisions of this Custodial Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be directed otherwise in writing by all of the other parties hereto or by a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The SPE Custodian may interplead all of the assets held hereunder into a court of competent jurisdiction or may seek a declaratory judgment with respect to certain circumstances, and thereafter be fully relieved from any and all liability or obligation with respect to such interpleaded assets or any action or non-action based on such declaratory judgment. Anything in this Custodial Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the SPE Custodian be liable for special, indirect, incidental or consequential damages, losses or penalties of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), regardless of the form of action.

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the SPE Custodian is not a fiduciary by virtue of accepting and carrying out its obligations under this Custodial Agreement and has not accepted any fiduciary duties, responsibilities or liabilities with respect to its services hereunder. The SPE Custodian shall not be required to risk or expend its own funds in performing its obligations under this Custodial Agreement. If and to the extent that Prepay LLC instructs the SPE Custodian to settle transactions in the Prepay LLC Revenue Account, Prepay LLC (i) shall cause such transactions to be funded by depositing with the SPE Custodian sufficient immediately available funds (provided that this requirement shall be satisfied if sufficient funds are available in the Prepay LLC Capital Account for transfer to the Prepay LLC Revenue Account consistent with Section 5(d) of this Custodial Agreement), (ii) shall not rely on the SPE Custodian to extend credit in order to settle any such transaction, and (iii) acknowledges that any transactions not fully funded by Prepay LLC may fail to settle. Subject to the requirements of Section 5(d) of this Custodial Agreement, if the SPE Custodian, in its sole discretion, permits an overdraft in the Prepay LLC Revenue Account or if Prepay LLC is for any other reason indebted to the SPE Custodian, Prepay LLC shall immediately deliver for credit to the Prepay LLC Revenue Account sufficient cash to eliminate such debit balance, plus accrued interest at a rate then charged by the SPE Custodian to its institutional custody clients in the relevant currency, which rate shall be supplied by the SPE Custodian to Prepay LLC from time to time.

Section 8. Removal, Resignation and Succession.

(a) The SPE Custodian may be removed with 30 days’ prior written notice by Prepay LLC, with a copy to each of the other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such removal of the SPE Custodian shall not be effective until a successor SPE Custodian has been appointed pursuant to this Section 8. The SPE Custodian’s rights under this Custodial Agreement to indemnity and any amounts due and payable to the SPE Custodian shall survive any such removal.
<!-- Page 474 -->
(b) The SPE Custodian may resign and be discharged from its duties or obligations hereunder by giving not less than 30 days’ advance notice in writing of such resignation to the other parties hereto specifying a date when such resignation shall take effect; and such resignation shall take effect upon the date specified in such notice unless a successor has not been appointed by the other parties to this Custodial Agreement on such date, in which event such resignation shall not take effect until a successor is appointed.

(c) In case at any time the SPE Custodian shall resign or shall be removed or shall become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or if a receiver, liquidator or conservator of the SPE Custodian, or of its property, shall be appointed, or if any public officer shall take charge or control of the SPE Custodian, or of its property or affairs, Prepay LLC, Issuer and J. Aron shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to appoint a successor custodian in a timely fashion, provided that any custodian appointed in succession to the SPE Custodian shall be a bank or trust company organized under the laws of any state or a national banking association and shall have capital stock, surplus and undivided earnings aggregating at least $50,000,000 and shall be a bank with trust powers or a trust company willing and able to accept the office on reasonable and customary terms and authorized by law to perform all the duties imposed upon it by this Custodial Agreement. Any corporation or association into which the SPE Custodian may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation or association to which all or substantially all of the SPE Custodian’s corporate trust line of business may be transferred, shall be the SPE Custodian under this Custodial Agreement without further act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no appointment as successor SPE Custodian shall be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 8 within 30 days after (i) Prepay LLC has given notice to the SPE Custodian and the other parties hereto of the SPE Custodian’s removal as provided in this Section 8 or (ii) the SPE Custodian has given to the other parties hereto written notice of its resignation as provided in this Section 8, the SPE Custodian may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor SPE Custodian. Said court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as such court may deem proper, appoint a successor SPE Custodian.

**Section 9. Fees.** J. Aron, as the sole member of Prepay LLC, agrees to pay the SPE Custodian reasonable compensation for the services to be rendered hereunder, which compensation shall be $32,500.00 for each year that this Custodial Agreement is in effect and shall be invoiced annually. The initial fee shall be calculated on a pro rata basis and shall be invoiced on May 1, 2024, and thereafter, on May 1 of each subsequent year. J.

**Section 11. Taxpayer Identification Numbers; Tax Matters.** Prepay LLC represents that its correct taxpayer identification number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority is set forth on the signature page hereof. Any tax returns or reports required to be prepared and filed in connection with the Prepay LLC Revenue Account and the Prepay LLC Capital Account will be prepared and filed by Prepay LLC and the SPE Custodian shall have no responsibility for the preparation and/or filing of any tax return with respect to any income earned on the Prepay LLC Revenue Account and the Prepay LLC Capital Account. In addition, any tax or other payments required to be made pursuant to such tax return or filing shall be paid by Prepay LLC.

Notwithstanding the above provisions of this Section 12, (i) in the case of communications delivered to the SPE Custodian pursuant to clause (b) or clause (c) of this Section 12 above, such communications shall be deemed to have been given on the date received by the SPE Custodian and (ii) in the case of the notifications required pursuant to Section 3(b), such notices may be given by e-mail to an e-mail address provided by the Funding Recipient to the SPE Custodian from time to time. In the event that the SPE Custodian, in its sole discretion, shall determine that an emergency exists, the SPE Custodian may use such other means of communication as the SPE Custodian deems appropriate.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Custodial Agreement to the contrary, the SPE Custodian shall have the right to accept and act upon instructions or directions provided by a party pursuant to this Custodial Agreement or by the Trustee, or any other document reasonably relating to the Bonds, if delivered using Electronic Means (as defined below); provided, however, that the applicable party shall provide to a Responsible Officer of the SPE Custodian an incumbency certificate listing designated individuals with the authority to provide such instructions (each an “Authorized Officer”) and containing specimen signatures of such Authorized Officers, which incumbency certificate shall be amended, with written notice to a Responsible Officer of the SPE Custodian, whenever an individual is to be added or deleted from the list of Authorized Officers.

the listing. If a party elects to give the SPE Custodian directions or instructions using Electronic Means and the SPE Custodian in its discretion elects to act upon such directions, the SPE Custodian’s understanding of such directions shall be deemed controlling. The party giving such instructions to the SPE Custodian understands and agrees that the SPE Custodian cannot determine the identity of the actual sender of such directions and that the SPE Custodian may conclusively presume that directions that purport to have been sent by an Authorized Officer listed on the incumbency certificate provided to a Responsible Officer of the SPE Custodian have been sent by such Authorized Officer. The party giving such instructions shall be solely responsible for ensuring that only Authorized Officers of such party transmit such directions to the SPE Custodian and that the party and all Authorized Officers treat applicable user and authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys as confidential and with extreme care. The SPE Custodian shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from its reliance upon and compliance with such instructions notwithstanding that such instructions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent written instruction. The party giving such instructions to the SPE Custodian agrees: (i) to assume all risks arising out of the use of Electronic Means (as defined below) to submit directions to the SPE Custodian, including without limitation the risk of the SPE Custodian acting on unauthorized directions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties; (ii) that it is fully informed of the protections and risks associated with the various methods of transmitting directions to the SPE Custodian and that there may be more secure methods of transmitting directions; (iii) that the security procedures (if any) to be followed in connection with its transmission of directions provide to it a commercially reasonable degree of protection in light of its particular needs and circumstances; (iv) to notify the SPE Custodian immediately upon learning of any compromise or unauthorized use of the security procedures; and (v) to indemnify and hold harmless the SPE Custodian against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred or sustained by the SPE Custodian as a result of or in connection with the SPE Custodian's reliance upon and compliance with instructions or directions given by Electronic Means (as defined below), except for any claim, damage or loss resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the SPE Custodian (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any amounts due under clause (v) of this Section 12 above shall not duplicate any other amounts due under this Custodial Agreement, including without limitation amounts due under Section 10 or Section 17 hereof).  
As used herein, “Electronic Means” shall mean instructions sent by S.W.I.F.T, e-mail, facsimile and other similar secure electronic transmission platform containing applicable authorization codes, passwords and/or authentication keys issued by the SPE Custodian (“Secure Platform”) or another method or system specified by a Responsible Officer of the SPE Custodian as available for use in connection with the SPE Custodian’s services hereunder. Access to and use of the SPE Custodian’s systems shall be subject to the terms and conditions contained in a separate written agreement. Prepay LLC, J. Aron and the Issuer shall be responsible for requesting access to any such system of the SPE Custodian and completing the documentation required for such access and nothing herein shall obligate the SPE Custodian to ensure any such access and the SPE Custodian shall have no responsibility or liability should such parties fail to, or elect not to, avail itself of such access. If the parties elect to use an on-line communications system owned or operated by a third party, the SPE Custodian shall have no responsibility or liability for the reliability or availability of any such service. All funds transfer instructions shall be sent utilizing a Secure Platform unless otherwise agreed by the SPE Custodian. When

# SCHEDULE I
## Valuation Services Terms and Conditions

1. On each Valuation Date, Valuation Agent shall determine the Delivery Amount and the Return Amount as herein described. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Credit Support Annex to the Back-End Commodity Swap.

2. On the Business Day prior to each Valuation Date as set forth in the Credit Support Annex to the Back-End Commodity Swap, Prepay LLC shall provide the Exposure under the Back-End Commodity Swap to the Valuation Agent. The Valuation Agent shall calculate the Delivery Amount and the Return Amount consistent with the terms of the Credit Support Annex (i.e., Exposure minus the Posted Collateral and the rounding and Minimum Transfer Amount specified in the Credit Support Annex). On each Valuation Date prior to the Notification Time specified in the Credit Support Annex to the Back-End Commodity Swap, Valuation Agent shall transmit to Prepay LLC and Swap Counterparty a report (“Report”) via e-mail of the values and other amounts determined in accordance with the preceding sentence. By electing to use e-mail for this purpose, Prepay LLC acknowledges that such transmissions are not encrypted and therefore are insecure. Prepay LLC further acknowledges that there are other risks inherent in communicating through the internet such as the possibility of virus contamination and disruptions in service, and agrees that Valuation Agent shall not be responsible for any loss, damage or expense suffered or incurred by any of the parties hereto or any other person claiming by or through the parties as a result of the use of such method.

3. Reports shall be produced on a basis and in such form and content as shall be mutually agreed between Valuation Agent and Prepay LLC. Prepay LLC shall examine (or cause to be examined) each Report and notify Valuation Agent of any error, omission or discrepancy by the close of business on the Business Day immediately following receipt of such Report. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that unless Valuation Agent is notified in writing of any error, omission or discrepancy by the close of the Business Day following receipt, each Report shall be deemed to be correct and conclusive in all respects, absent manifest error. In the event of any errors or omissions in any Report, Valuation Agent’s sole responsibility and liability shall be the preparation of a corrected Report at no additional cost.

4. Valuation Agent is authorized to utilize any generally recognized pricing or other information service providers reasonably believed by it to be reliable in order to perform its valuation and other responsibilities hereunder. The parties hereto understand and agree that certain pricing information with respect to complex financial instruments (e.g., derivatives) may be based on calculated amounts rather than actual market transactions and may not reflect actual market values, and that the variance between such calculated amounts and actual market values may or may not be material. Where pricing and other information service providers do not provide information for particular securities or other property, Prepay LLC may advise Valuation Agent regarding the fair market value of, or provide other information with respect to, such securities or property as determined by it in good faith. It is acknowledged and agreed that information supplied by such pricing or other information service providers may be incorrect or
<!-- Page 488 -->
incomplete and Valuation Agent shall not be liable for any loss, damage or expense incurred as a result of errors or omissions with respect to any pricing or other information utilized by Valuation Agent hereunder.

# 2002 MASTER AGREEMENT  
dated as of [___]  

**J. ARON & COMPANY LLC** and **NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY**  

have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a “Transaction”) that are or will be governed by this 2002 Master Agreement, which includes the schedule (the “Schedule”), and the documents and other confirming evidence (each a “Confirmation”) exchanged between the parties or otherwise effective for the purpose of confirming or evidencing those Transactions. This 2002 Master Agreement and the Schedule are together referred to as this “Master Agreement”.  

Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:—  

1. **Interpretation.**  

   (a) **Definitions.** The terms defined in Section 14 and elsewhere in this Master Agreement will have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master Agreement.  

   (b) **Inconsistency.** In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement, such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction.  

   (c) **Single Agreement.** All Transactions are entered into reliance on the fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties (collectively referred to as this “Agreement”), and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions.  

2. **Obligations.**  

   (a) **General Conditions.**  

   (i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement.  

   (ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value on that date in the place of the account specified in the relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.

![ISDA 2002](https://www.isda.org/a/0bq0g0000000g0e/2002-isda-master-agreement)  

(iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1) the condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively designated and (3) each other condition specified in this Agreement to be a condition precedent for the purpose of this Section 2(a)(iii).

(b) Change of Account. Either party may change its account for receiving a payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local Business Days prior to the Scheduled Settlement Date for the payment or delivery to which such change applies unless such other party gives timely notice of a reasonable objection to such change.

(c) Netting of Payments. If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:—

(i) in the same currency; and

(ii) in respect of the same Transaction,

by each party to the other, then, on such date, each party’s obligation to make payment of any such amount will be automatically satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by which the larger aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.

The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount and payment obligation will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the same currency in respect of those Transactions, regardless of whether such amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made in the Schedule or any Confirmation specifying that “Multiple Transaction Payment Netting” applies to the Transactions identified as being subject to the election (in which case clause (ii) above will not apply to such Transactions). If Multiple Transaction Payment Netting is applicable to Transactions, it will apply to those Transactions with effect from the starting date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation, or, if a starting date is not specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation, the starting date otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions and will apply separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive payments or deliveries.

(d) Deduction or Withholding for Tax.

(i) Gross-Up. All payments under this Agreement will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party (“X”) will—

(1) promptly notify the other party (“Y”) of such requirement;

(2) pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including the full amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under this Section 2(d) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount has been assessed against Y;

(3) promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a certified copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such authorities; and
<!-- Page 492 -->
(4) if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will not be required to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid but for:—  
(A) the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or  
(B) the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would not have occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, after a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.  

(ii) Liability. If:—  
(1) X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, to make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4);  
(2) X does not so deduct or withhold; and  
(3) a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against X,  
then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to X the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).  

3. Representations  
Each party makes the representations contained in Sections 3(a), 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), 3(e) and, if specified in the Schedule as applying, 3(g) to the other party (which representations will be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the termination of this Agreement). If any “Additional Representation” is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the party or parties specified for such Additional Representation will make and, if applicable, be deemed to repeat such Additional Representation at the time or times specified for such Additional Representation.  

(a) Basic Representations.  
(i) Status. It is duly organised and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation and, if relevant under such laws, in good standing;  
(ii) Powers. It has the power to execute this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party, to deliver this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement that it is required by this Agreement to deliver and to perform its obligations under this Agreement and any obligations it has under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and has taken all necessary action to authorize such execution, delivery and performance;  

3  
ISDA® 2002
<!-- Page 493 -->
(iii) **No Violation or Conflict.** Such execution, delivery and performance do not violate or conflict with any law applicable to it, any provision of its constitutional documents, any order or judgment of any court or other agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets or any contractual restriction binding on or affecting it or any of its assets;

(b) **Absence of Certain Events.** No Event of Default or Potential Event of Default or, to its knowledge, Termination Event with respect to it has occurred and is continuing and no such event or circumstance would occur as a result of its entering into or performing its obligations under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.

(c) **Absence of Litigation.** There is not pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against it, any of its Credit Support Providers or any of its applicable Specified Entities any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or official or any arbitrator that is likely to affect the legality, validity or enforceability against it of this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party or its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or such Credit Support Document.

(iii) upon reasonable demand by such other party, any form or document that may be required or reasonably requested in writing in order to allow such other party or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment under this Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion, execution or submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of such demand), with any such form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification,

in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.

(b) Maintain Authorisations. It will use all reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect all consents of any governmental or other authority that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and will use all reasonable efforts to obtain any that may become necessary in the future.

(2) a default by such party, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity (individually or collectively) in making one or more payments under such agreements or instruments on the due date for payment (after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period) in an aggregate amount, either alone or together with the amount, if any, referred to in clause (1) above, of not less than the applicable Threshold Amount;  

(vii) **Bankruptcy.** The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party:—  
(1) is dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (2) becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts or fails or admits in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as they become due; (3) makes a general assignment, arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of its creditors; (4)(A) institutes or has instituted against it, by a regulator, supervisory or similar official with primary insolvency, rehabilitative or regulatory jurisdiction over it in the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization or the jurisdiction of its head or home office, a proceeding seeking a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors’ rights, or a petition is presented for its winding-up or liquidation by it or such regulator, supervisor or similar official, or (B) has instituted against it a proceeding seeking a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors’ rights, or a petition is presented for its winding-up or liquidation, and such proceeding or petition is instituted or presented by a person or entity not described in clause (A) above and either (I) results in a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or the entry of an order for relief or the making of an order for its winding-up or liquidation or (II) is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained in each case within 15 days of the institution or presentation thereof; (5) has a resolution passed for its winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (6) seeks or becomes subject to the appointment of an administrator, provisional liquidator, conservator, receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar person for it or for all or substantially all its assets; (7) has a secured party take possession of all or substantially all its assets or has a distress, execution, attachment, sequestration or other legal process levied, enforced or sued on or against all or substantially all its assets and such secured party maintains possession, or any such process is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained in each case within 15 days thereafter; (8) causes or is subject to any event with respect to it which, under the applicable laws of any jurisdiction, has an analogous effect to any of the events specified in clauses (1) to (7) above (inclusive); or (9) takes any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the foregoing acts; or

(viii) **Merger Without Assumption.** The party or any Credit Support Provider of such party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, or reorganizes, reincorporates or reconstitutes into or as, another entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, transfer, reorganization, reincorporation or reconstitution:—

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume all the obligations of such party or such Credit Support Provider under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it or its predecessor was a party; or

(2) the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend (without the consent of the other party) to the performance by such resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its obligations under this Agreement.

(b) **Termination Events.** The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any event specified below constitutes (subject to Section 5(c)) an Illegality if the event is specified in clause (i) below, a Force Majeure Event if the event is specified in clause (ii) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in clause (iii) below, a Tax Event Upon Merger if the event is specified in clause (iv) below, and, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event Upon Merger if the event is specified pursuant to clause (v) below:—

(i) **Illegality.** After giving effect to any applicable provision, disruption fallback or remedy specified in, or pursuant to, the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement, due to an event or circumstance (other than any action taken by a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party) occurring after a Transaction is entered into, it becomes unlawful under any applicable law (including without limitation the laws of any country in which, payment, delivery or compliance is required by either party or any Credit Support Provider, as the case may be), on any day, or it would be unlawful in the relevant party, delivery or compliance were required on that day (in each case, other than as a result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)):—

(1) for the Office through which such party (which will be the Affected Party) makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to such Transaction to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction, to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other material provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or

(2) for such party or any Credit Support Provider of such party (which will be the Affected Party) to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery which such party or Credit Support Provider has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction, to receive a payment or delivery under such Credit Support Document or to comply with any other material provision of such Credit Support Document;

(ii) **Force Majeure Event.** After giving effect to any applicable provision, disruption fallback or remedy specified in, or pursuant to, the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement, by reason of force majeure or act of state occurring after a Transaction is entered into, on any day:—

(1) the Office through which such party (which will be the Affected Party) makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to such Transaction is prevented from performing any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction, from receiving a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or from complying with any other material provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction (or would be so prevented if such payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day), or it becomes impossible or

8  
ISDA © 2002
<!-- Page 498 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
impracticable for such Office so to perform, receive or comply (or it would be impossible or impracticable for such Office so to perform, receive or comply if such payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day); or  

(2) such party or any Credit Support Provider of such party (which will be the Affected Party) is prevented from performing any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery which such party or Credit Support Provider has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction, from receiving a payment or delivery under such Credit Support Document or from complying with any other material provision of such Credit Support Document (or would be so prevented if such payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day), or it becomes impossible or impracticable for such party or Credit Support Provider so to perform, receive or comply (or it would be impossible or impracticable for such party or Credit Support Provider so to perform, receive or comply if such payment, delivery or compliance were required on that day),  

so long as the force majeure or act of state is beyond the control of such Office, such party or such Credit Support Provider, as appropriate, and such Office, party or Credit Support Provider could not, after using all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party or Credit Support Provider to incur a loss, other than immaterial, incidental expenses), overcome such prevention, impossibility or impracticability;  

(iii) Tax Event. Due to (1) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, after a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (2) a Change in Tax Law, the party (which will be the Affected Party) will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding Scheduled Settlement Date (A) be required to pay to the other party an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 9(h)) or (B) receive a payment from which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in respect of interest under Section 9(h)) and no additional amount is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B));  

(iv) Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the “Burdened Party”) on the next succeeding Scheduled Settlement Date will either (1) be required to pay an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 9(h)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or withheld for or on account of any Tax in respect of which the other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of a party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or transferring all or substantially all its assets (or any substantial part of the assets comprising the business conducted by it as of the date of this Master Agreement) to, or reorganizing, reincorporating or reconstituting into or as, another entity (which will be the Affected Party) where such action does not constitute a Merger Without Assumption;  

(v) Credit Event Upon Merger. If “Credit Event Upon Merger” is specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, a Designated Event (as defined below) occurs with respect to such party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party (in each case, “X”) and such Designated Event does not constitute a Merger Without Assumption, and the creditworthiness of X or, if applicable, the successor, surviving or transferee entity of X, after taking into account any applicable Credit Support Document, is materially weaker immediately after the occurrence of such Designated Event than that of X immediately prior to the occurrence of such Designated Event (and, in any such event, such party or its successor, surviving or transferee entity, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party). A “Designated Event” with respect to X means that:—  

(1) X consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets (or any substantial part of the assets comprising the business conducted by X as of the  
<!-- Page 499 -->
![ISDA 2002](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=ISDA+2002+Document)

**10**

date of this Master Agreement) to, or reorganizes, reincorporates or reconstitutes into or as, another entity;

(2) any person, related group of persons or entity acquires directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of (A) equity securities having the power to elect a majority of the board of directors (or its equivalent) of X or (B) any other ownership interest enabling it to exercise control of X; or

(3) X effects any substantial change in its capital structure by means of the issuance, incurrence or guarantee of debt or the issuance of (A) preferred stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for debt or preferred stock or (B) in the case of entities other than corporations, any other form of ownership interest; or

(vi) **Additional Termination Event.** If any “Additional Termination Event” is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or Affected Parties will be as specified for such Additional Termination Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).

(c) **Hierarchy of Events.**

(i) An event or circumstance that constitutes or gives rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event will not, for so long as that is the case, also constitute or give rise to an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i), 5(a)(ii)(1) or 5(a)(iii)(1) insofar as such event or circumstance relates to the failure to make any payment or delivery or a failure to comply with any other material provision of this Agreement or a Credit Support Document, as the case may be.

(ii) Except in circumstances contemplated by clause (i) above, if an event or circumstance which would otherwise constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event also constitutes an Event of Default or any other Termination Event, it will be treated as an Event of Default or such other Termination Event, as the case may be, and will not constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event.

(iii) If an event or circumstance which would otherwise constitute or give rise to a Force Majeure Event also constitutes an Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality, except as described in clause (ii) above, and not a Force Majeure Event.

(d) **Deferral of Payments and Deliveries During Waiting Period.** If an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event has occurred and is continuing with respect to a Transaction, each payment or delivery which would otherwise be required to be made under that Transaction will be deferred to, and will not be due until:—

(i) the first Local Business Day or, in the case of a delivery, the first Local Delivery Day (or the first day that would have been a Local Business Day or Local Delivery Day, as appropriate, but for the occurrence of the event or circumstance constituting or giving rise to that Illegality or Force Majeure Event) following the end of any applicable Waiting Period in respect of that Illegality or Force Majeure Event, as the case may be; or

(ii) if earlier, the date on which the event or circumstance constituting or giving rise to that Illegality or Force Majeure Event ceases to exist or, if such date is not a Local Business Day or, in the case of a delivery, a Local Delivery Day, the first following day that is a Local Business Day or Local Delivery Day, as appropriate.

(e) **Inability of Head or Home Office to Perform Obligations of Branch.** If (i) an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event occurs under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or 5(b)(ii)(1) and the relevant Office is not the Affected Party’s head or home office, (ii) Section 10(a) applies, (iii) the other party seeks performance of the relevant obligation or

**ISDA® 2002**
<!-- Page 500 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

compliance with the relevant provision by the Affected Party’s head or home office and (iv) the Affected Party’s head or home office fails to perform or comply due to the occurrence of an event or circumstance which would, if it had or home office were the Office through which the Affected Party makes and receives payments and deliveries with respect to the relevant Transaction, constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event, and such failure would otherwise constitute an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i) or 5(a)(iii)(1) with respect to such party, then, for so long as the relevant event or circumstance continues to exist with respect to both the Office referred to in Section 5(b)(i)(1) or 5(b)(ii)(1), as the case may be, and the Affected Party’s head or home office, such failure will not constitute an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(i) or 5(a)(iii)(1).

6. Early Termination; Close-Out Netting

(a) Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of Default with respect to a party (the “Defaulting Party”) has occurred and is then continuing, the other party (the “Non-defaulting Party”) may, by not more than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however, “Automatic Early Termination” is specified in the Schedule as applying to a party, an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6), or to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).

(b) Right to Terminate Following Termination Event.

(i) Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, a Force Majeure Event occurs, each party promptly upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction, and will also give the other party such information about termination Event as the other party may reasonably require. If a Force Majeure Event occurs, each party will, promptly upon becoming aware of it, use all reasonable efforts to notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Force Majeure Event, and will also give the other party such other information about that Force Majeure Event as the other party may reasonably require.

(ii) Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(i), use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, other than immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist.

If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to the other party to that effect within such 20 day period, whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).

Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld if such other party’s policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed.

(iii) Two Affected Parties. If a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use all reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice of such occurrence is given under Section 6(b)(i) to avoid that Termination Event.

11 ISDA® 2002
<!-- Page 501 -->
(iv) Right to Terminate.

(1) If:—
  
(A) a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or

(B) a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event, or a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party,

the Burdened Party in the case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party in the case of a Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there are two Affected Parties, or the Non-Affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one Affected Party may, if the relevant Termination Event is then continuing, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions.

(2) If at any time an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event has occurred and is then continuing and any applicable Waiting Period has expired:—

(A) Subject to clause (B) below, either party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party, designate (I) a day not earlier than the day on which such notice becomes effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions or (II) by specifying in that notice the Affected Transactions in respect of which it is designating the relevant day as an Early Termination Date, a day not earlier than two Local Business Days following the day on which such notice becomes effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of less than all Affected Transactions. Upon receipt of a notice designating an Early Termination Date in respect of less than all Affected Transactions, the other party may, by notice to the designating party, if such notice is effective on or before the day so designated, designate that same day as an Early Termination Date in respect of any or all other Affected Transactions.

(B) An Affected Party (if the Illegality or Force Majeure Event relates to performance by such party or any Credit Support Provider of such party of an obligation to make any payment or delivery under, or to compliance with any other material provision of, the relevant Credit Support Document) will only have the right to designate an Early Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv)(2)(AA) as a result of an Illegality under Section 5(b)(ii)(2) following the prior designation by the other party of an Early Termination Date, pursuant to Section 6(b)(iv)(2)(A), in respect of less than all Affected Transactions.

(c) Effect of Designation.

(i) If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section 6(a) or 6(b), the Early Termination Date will occur on the date so designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination Event is then continuing.

(ii) Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 9(h)(i) in respect of the Terminated Transactions will be required to be made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date will be determined pursuant to Sections 6(e) and 9(h)(ii).

12  
ISDA® 2002
<!-- Page 502 -->
(d) Calculations; Payment Date.

(i) Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail, such calculations (including any quotations, market data or information from internal sources used in making such calculations), (2) specifying (except where there are two Affected Parties) an Early Termination Amount payable and (3) giving details of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of written confirmation from the source of a quotation or market data obtained in determining a Close-out Amount, the records of the party obtaining such quotation or market data will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of such quotation or market data.

(ii) Payment Date. An Early Termination Amount due in respect of any Early Termination Date will, together with any amount of interest payable pursuant to Section 9(h)(ii)(2), be payable (1) on the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of Default and (2) on the day which is two Local Business Days after the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (or, if there are two Affected Parties, after the day on which the statement provided pursuant to clause (i) above by the second party to provide such a statement is effective) in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event.

(e) Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the amount, if any, payable in respect of that Early Termination Date (the “Early Termination Amount”) will be determined pursuant to this Section 6(e) and will be subject to Section 6(f).

(i) Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default, the Early Termination Amount will be an amount equal to (A) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the sum of the Close-out Amount or Close-out Amounts (whether positive or negative) determined by the Non-defaulting Party for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party less (2) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party. If the Early Termination Amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of Early Termination Amount to the Defaulting Party.

(ii) Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a Termination Event:—

(1) One Affected Party. Subject to clause (3) below, if there is one Affected Party, the Early Termination Amount will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i), except that references to the Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the Affected Party and to the Non-affected Party, respectively.

(2) Two Affected Parties. Subject to clause (3) below, if there are two Affected Parties, each party will determine an amount equal to the Termination Currency Equivalent of the sum of the Close-out Amount or Close-out Amounts (whether positive or negative) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and the Early Termination Amount will be an amount equal to (A) the sum of (1) one-half of the difference between the higher amount so determined (by party “X”) and lower amount so determined (by party “Y”) and (II) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X less (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y. If the Early Termination Amount is a positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of the Early Termination Amount to Y.

13  
ISDA® 2002
<!-- Page 503 -->
(3) Mid-Market Events. If that Termination Event is an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event, then the Early Termination Amount will be determined in accordance with clause (1) or (2) above, as appropriate, except that, for the purpose of determining a Close-out Amount or Close-out Amounts, the Determining Party will:—

(A) if obtaining quotations from one or more third parties (or from any of the Determining Party’s Affiliates), ask each third party or Affiliate (I) not to take account of the creditworthiness of the Determining Party or any existing Credit Support Document and (II) to provide mid-market quotations; and

(B) in any other case, use mid-market values without regard to the creditworthiness of the Determining Party.

(iii) Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early Termination Date occurs because Automatic Early Termination applies in respect of a party, Early Termination Amount will be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by applicable law to reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii).

(iv) Adjustment for Illegality or Force Majeure Event. The failure by a party or any Credit Support Provider of such party to pay, when due, any Early Termination Amount will not constitute an Event of Default under Section 5(a)(ii) or 5(a)(iii)(1) if such failure is due to the occurrence of an event or circumstance which would, if it occurred with respect to payment, delivery or compliance related to a Transaction, constitute or give rise to an Illegality or a Force Majeure Event. Such amount will (1) accrue interest and otherwise be treated as an Unpaid Amount owing to the other party if subsequently an Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default, a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event in respect of which all outstanding Transactions are Affected Transactions and (2) otherwise accrue interest in accordance with Section 9(h)(ii)(2).

(v) Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that an amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and the loss of protection against future risks, and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, neither party will be entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of the termination of the Terminated Transactions.

(f) Set-Off. Any Early Termination Amount payable to one party (the “Payee”) by the other party (the “Payer”), in circumstances where there is a Defaulting Party or where there is one Affected Party in the case where either a Credit Event Upon Merger has occurred or any other Termination Event in respect of which all outstanding Transactions are Affected Transactions has occurred, will, at the option of the Non-defaulting Party or the Non-affected Party, as the case may be (“X”) (and without prior notice to the Defaulting Party or the Affected Party, as the case may be), be reduced by its set-off against any other amounts (“Other Amounts”) payable by the Payee to the Payer (whether or not arising under this Agreement, matured or contingent and irrespective of the currency, place of payment or place of booking of the obligation). To the extent that any Other Amounts are so set off, those Other Amounts will be discharged promptly and in all respects. X will give notice to the other party of any set-off effected under this Section 6(f).

For this purpose, either the Early Termination Amount or the Other Amounts (or the relevant portion of such amounts) may be converted by X into the currency in which the other is denominated at the rate of exchange at which such party would be able, in good faith and using commercially reasonable procedures, to purchase the relevant amount of such currency.

14  
ISDA © 2002
<!-- Page 504 -->
![ISDA 2002](https://example.com/image.png)

If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and set off in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.

Nothing in this Section 6(f) will be effective to create a charge or other security interest. This Section 6(f) will be without prejudice and in addition to any right of set-off, offset, combination of accounts, lien, right of retention or withholding or similar right or requirement to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled or subject (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).

7. Transfer

Subject to Section 6(b)(ii) and to the extent permitted by applicable law, neither this Agreement nor any interest or obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, except that:—

(a) a party may make such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any other right or remedy under this Agreement); and

(b) a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any Early Termination Amount payable to it by a Defaulting Party, together with any amounts payable on or with respect to that interest and any other rights associated with that interest pursuant to Sections 8, 9(h) and 11.

Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this Section 7 will be void.

8. Contractual Currency

(a) Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that payment (the “Contractual Currency”). To the extent permitted by applicable law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency will not be discharged or satisfied by tender in any currency other than the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in good faith and using commercially reasonable procedures in converting the currency so tendered into the Contractual Currency, of the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of such excess.

(b) Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or order expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered (i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this Agreement or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the payment of any amount described in clause (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is entitled pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any variation between the rate of exchange at which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purpose of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting in good faith and using

15  
ISDA® 2002
<!-- Page 505 -->

10. Offices; Multibranch Parties  
(a) If Section 10(a) is specified in the Schedule as applying, each party that enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home office represents to and agrees with the other party that, notwithstanding the place of booking or its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, its obligations are the same in terms of recourse against it as if it had entered into the Transaction through its head or home office, except that a party will not have recourse to the head or home office of the other party in respect of any payment or delivery deferred pursuant to Section 5(d) for so long as the payment or delivery is so deferred. This representation and agreement will be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on which the parties enter into a Transaction.

(c) Termination Events. No Termination Events shall apply to either Aron or Counterparty other than the Additional Termination Event described below.

(d) Additional Termination Event. It shall be an Additional Termination Event hereunder if there occurs a Termination Payment Event under and as defined in the Amended & Restated Prepaid Commodity Sales Agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented, replaced or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Prepaid Contract”), dated as of the date hereof, between Aron Energy Prepay [ ] LLC and the Counterparty for any reason (regardless of whether such Termination Payment Event is automatic or at the election of either party to the Prepaid Contract, and regardless of whether any rights or remedies of a party to the Prepaid Contract in connection with or resulting from such Termination Payment Event are stayed, enjoined or otherwise prevented or limited for any reason), in which case all Transactions hereunder shall terminate automatically as of the Early Termination Payment Date under and as defined in the Prepaid.

(e) “Specified Transaction”. The definition of “Specified Transaction” in Section 14 of the Agreement is amended as follows:

(i) In the sixth line, insert the words “commodity spot transaction” after the words “commodity option”;

(ii) In the tenth line, delete the words “weather index transaction” and insert the words “weather swap, weather derivative, weather option, freight option, emission allowance, emission allowance swap, emission allowance option”.

(g) Payments on Early Termination. Section 6(e) of the Agreement is deleted and replaced in its entirety with the following:

“(e) Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, each party will pay to the other party any Unpaid Amounts due to such other party (subject to any netting pursuant to Section 2)(c) (the “Early Termination Amount”), and no other amounts shall be payable by either party.

WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO PAYMENTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE BY EITHER PARTY OR HAVE FALLEN DUE IN RESPECT OF A TRANSACTION GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EARLY TERMINATION DATE IN RESPECT OF THAT TRANSACTION AND WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS SECTION 6(e) WITH RESPECT TO THE OBLIGATIONS TO PAY UNPAID AMOUNTS, THE PARTIES AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT:

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

(i) THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE ANY PAYMENT UNDER THAT TRANSACTION ARE CONDITIONAL UPON SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE NOT HAVING OCCURRED ON OR BEFORE THE DATE SPECIFIED FOR THAT PAYMENT PURSUANT TO THE CONFIRMATION EVIDENCING THAT TRANSACTION AND NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE ANY OBLIGATION TO MAKE THAT PAYMENT IF, ON OR BEFORE THE DATE SPECIFIED FOR THAT PAYMENT, SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE HAS OCCURRED;

(ii) EACH PARTY’S RIGHT TO RECEIVE ANY PAYMENTS UNDER THAT TRANSACTION IS INDEPENDENT OF ITS RIGHT TO RECEIVE ANY PAYMENTS WHICH HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN MADE, OR WHICH HAVE FALLEN DUE, UNDER THAT TRANSACTION BEFORE THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE AND A PARTY’S ENTITLEMENT TO RECEIVE SUBSEQUENT PAYMENTS IS NOT UNCONDITIONALLY EARNED BY THE MAKING OF ANY PREVIOUS PAYMENTS PRIOR TO THE OCCURRENCE OF SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE;

(iii) IT SHALL BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COUNTERPARTY TO ENSURE THAT ITS ACCOUNTING, REGULATORY AND ALL OTHER TREATMENTS OF THAT TRANSACTION ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CONDITIONAL NATURE OF ITS ENTITLEMENT TO RECEIVE ANY PAYMENT UNDER THAT TRANSACTION; AND

(iv) THAT TRANSACTION HAS BEEN EXECUTED UNDER MATERIALLY DIFFERENT TERMS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TERMS) FROM THOSE WHICH WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR A TRANSACTION WHERE THE PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES WERE NOT SUBJECT TO THE EARLY TERMINATION PROVISIONS (AS SET FORTH HEREIN).

The parties agree and acknowledge that they are party to other agreements containing provisions, when analyzed together with the provisions in this Agreement regarding the consequences of the occurrence of such Early Termination Date (the “Early Termination Provisions”), provide a commercial incentive to agree to those Early Termination Provisions.

(h) “Termination Currency” means United States Dollar (“USD”).

(i) Grace Periods. The parties agree to amend clause (vii) of Section 5(a) as follows:

(i) clause (vii)(4): delete, following the word “above” in line 15, the clause beginning “and either (I) results in” and ending with the word “thereof” in line 18;

(ii) clause (vii)(6): add to the end thereof the following: “or, in the case of Counterparty, (A) there shall be appointed or designated with respect to it, an entity such as an organization, board, commission, authority, agency or body to monitor, review, oversee, recommend or declare a financial emergency or similar state of financial distress with respect to it or (B) there shall be declared or introduced or proposed for consideration by it or by legislative or regulatory body with competent jurisdiction over it, the existence of a state of financial emergency or similar state of financial distress in respect of it;”;

(iii) clause (vii)(7): delete, following the word “assets” in line 24, the clause beginning with “and such secured party” and ending with the word “thereafter” in line 26, to eliminate the 15-day grace period.

(j) Early Termination.

(i) Section (6)(a) shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

“Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of Default with respect to a party (the “Defaulting Party”) has occurred and is then continuing, the other party (the “Non-defaulting Party”) may, by not more than 20 days’ notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions; provided, however, that the foregoing maximum 20-day notice shall not apply in the case where the Non-Defaulting Party expects a redemption date pursuant to the Bond Indenture to occur in connection with the declaration of an Early Termination Date under this Agreement, in which case the Early Termination Date shall be the latest “Early Termination Payment Date” (as defined in the Prepaid Contract) to occur under the Prepaid Contract. If, however, “Automatic Early Termination” is specified in the Schedule as applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions shall be designated automatically, immediately upon (i) the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8) or (ii) the occurrence of an Additional Termination Event as set forth in Part 1(d) of this Schedule and such Early Termination Date shall be the latest “Early Termination Payment Date” (as defined above) to occur under the Prepaid Contract.

(ii) Section 6(c)(ii) shall be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

“Upon the occurrence of an Early Termination Date in respect of a Transaction, other than with respect to Unpaid Amounts, neither party shall have any obligation to make any further payments under such Transaction if and to the extent that the scheduled due date for such payments is any day on or after such Early Termination Date, without prejudice to Section 6(e) of this Agreement.”

(iii) The definition of “Affected Transactions” shall be amended and restated as follows:

“‘Affected Transactions’ means all Transactions”.

(iv) The definition of “Unpaid Amounts” shall be amended and restated as follows:

“‘Unpaid Amounts’ owing to any party means, with respect to an Early Termination Date, the aggregate of (a) in respect of all Terminated Transactions, the amounts that became payable (or that would have become payable but for Section 2(a)(iii)) to such party under Section 2(a)(ii) on or prior to such Early Termination Date and which remain unpaid as of such Early Termination Date, and (b) in respect of each Terminated Transaction, (i) for any Calculation Period (as defined in the Confirmation for such Terminated Transaction) under such Terminated Transaction (A) that has ended prior to such day and (B) for which the Scheduled Settlement Date for such Terminated Transaction has not yet occurred, the

(b) Payee Tax Representations.

For the purpose of Section 3(f), Aron and Counterparty make the following representations:

(ii) Counterparty represents that is a [____].

(c) Condition to Transfer under Section 7. Upon any transfer by Counterparty pursuant to Section 7, Counterparty agrees to provide Aron with the name and address of the transferee so that Aron may fulfill its requirements to record the transfer on its books and records, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, should Counterparty fail to do so, Aron will be entitled to make all payments under this Agreement after making any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax as required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant government revenue authority and under no circumstances will Aron be required to pay an additional amount under Section 2(d)(i)(4).

Part 5. Other Provisions.

(a) Conditions. Section 2(a)(iii) is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following text:

(i) Non-Speculation.

(ii) No Immunity. Counterparty is not entitled to and shall not assert the defense of sovereign immunity with respect to its obligations or any claims under this Agreement.

(iii) Legal Investment. This Agreement and each Transaction hereunder do not constitute any kind of investment by Counterparty that is proscribed by any constitution, charter, law, rule, regulation, government code, constituent or governing instrument, resolution, guideline, ordinance, order, writ, judgment, decree, charge, or ruling to which Counterparty (or any of its officials in their respective capacities as such) or its property is subject.
<!-- Page 529 -->
(iv) **Assets of Counterparty.** No Affiliate or other person, firm, corporation, entity or association may liquidate, borrow, encumber or otherwise utilize the assets of Counterparty.

(v) **Organization.** Counterparty is a state or political subdivision thereof, or an instrumentality, agency or department of either of the foregoing.

(vi) **Official Statements.** No official statement or similar disclosure document contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(vii) **Valid Purpose.** The execution and delivery by Counterparty of this Agreement, each Confirmation and any other documentation relating hereto, and the performance by Counterparty of its obligations hereunder and thereunder, are in furtherance, and not in violation, of the public purposes for which Counterparty is organized pursuant to the laws of the state in which Counterparty is organized.

(e) **Additional Agreements.**

(i) The introductory clause of Section 4 of this Agreement is hereby amended to read in its entirety as follows:

“Each party agrees with the other (and, in the case of Sections 4(f) and (g), Counterparty agrees with the other party) that, so long as either party has or may have any obligation under this Agreement or under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.”.

(ii) Section 4 of this Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following Sections (f), (g) and (h) thereto:

“(f) **Compliance with Covered Document.** Counterparty will observe, perform and fulfill each covenant, term, and provision in the Covered Document applicable to Counterparty in effect on the date specified in the Confirmation for the related Bond Transaction, as any of those covenants, terms, and provisions may be amended, supplemented or modified for the purposes of this Agreement with the prior written consent of the other party hereto (the “Incorporated Provisions”), with the effect, among other things, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, that such other party hereto will have the benefit of each of the Incorporated Provisions (including, without limitation, covenants, right to consent to certain actions subject to consent under the Covered Document, and delivery of financial statements and other notices and information). In the event the Covered Document ceases to be in effect for any reason, including, without limitation, defeasance of financial statements and other notices and information.”

The Incorporated Provisions are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement to the same extent as if such provisions were set forth herein. For purposes of this Agreement, the Incorporated Provisions shall be construed as though (i) all references therein to any party making loans, extensions of credit or financial accommodations thereunder or commitments therefor (the “Financings”) were to the other party hereto and (ii) to the extent that such Incorporated Provisions are conditioned on or related to the existence of such Financings or Counterparty having any obligations in connection therewith, all references to such Financings or obligations were to the obligations of Counterparty under this Agreement. Any amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of any of the Incorporated Provisions without the prior written consent of Aron shall have no force and effect with respect to this Agreement. Any amendment, supplement or modification for which such consent is obtained shall be part of the Incorporated Provisions for purposes of this Agreement.

(g) Notice of Incipient Illegality.

**PRELIMINARY OFFICIAL STATEMENT DATED __________, 2024**  
**RATING: (SEE “RATING” HEREIN)**  

**NEW ISSUE - BOOK-ENTRY ONLY**

Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds. See “TAX MATTERS” herein.

Capitalized terms used in this cover page and not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in this Official Statement.

The Bonds will be authorized in an aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000 or any integral multiple thereof in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”). The principal, Redemption Price, and the rate of interest on the Bonds will be paid by the Trustee. Purchasers of the Bonds will not receive physical delivery of bond certificates.

From their initial Sale Date to and including the Fixed Rate Period, as shown on the inside cover page and as described herein, the Bonds will bear interest semiannually on each [January 1] and [July 1], commencing __________, 20__ (the “Mandatory Purchase Date”).

1. **Bond Issuance:** The Northern California Energy Authority ("NCEA") will issue the Bonds to refund the 2018 Bonds, prepare for additional Commodity quantities, fund commodity swap and debt service reserves, and pay costs of issuance. The Bonds will bear interest at a fixed rate tied to the Interest Rate Reset Period.

2. **Prepayment:** In 2018, NCEA issued the 2018 Bonds to finance a prepayment to J. Aron & Company LLC ("J. Aron") for an approximately thirty-year supply of Commodities. Effective on the Initial Issue Date of the Bonds, J. Aron will transfer its interest under the 2018 prepayment transaction to Aron Energy Partners 33 LLC ("AEP33"). NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will enter into the Amended & Restated Prepaid Commodity Sales Agreement (the "Commodity Purchase Agreement"). Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, NCEA will pay for additional Commodity quantities and the Commodity Supplier shall be obligated to (a) deliver specified quantities of gas each month to NCEA during the Gas Delivery Period and specified hourly quantities of electricity during the Electricity Delivery Period; (b) make payments for any commodities not delivered on a fixed basis or the market price, whichever is higher; and (c) make a Termination Payment upon a Termination Payment Event, as described herein.

3. **Funding Agreement:** The Commodity Supplier and J. Aron (the "Funding Recipient"), will enter into a Agreement (the "Funding Agreement") pursuant to which the Commodity Supplier will loan/deposit a specified amount to the Funding Recipient and the Funding Recipient will be obligated to pay Scheduled Withdrawal Amounts to the Commodity Supplier and certain amounts upon any early termination of the Funding Agreement. The Scheduled Withdrawal Amounts payable under the Funding Agreement provide amounts sufficient to meet the Commodity Supplier's monthly Commodity purchase obligations, net of receipts (payments) under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap. The Funding Agreement provides a fixed interest rate for a term equal to the Interest Rate Reset Period on the Bonds and will mature at the end of such Period.

4. **Commodity Supply:** The Commodity Supplier will purchase Commodities from J. Aron under a long-term Commodity Sale and Service Agreement for a prescribed scheduled quantities and delivery points that matches the corresponding schedule under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Commodity Supplier will pay for the Commodities monthly in arrears. J. Aron’s payment obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement will be guaranteed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. ("GS").

5. **Project Participant:** Under the Commodity Supply Contract (which has been in effect since 2018), NCEA will sell to Sacramento Municipal Utility District all of the natural gas delivered by the Commodity Supplier during the Gas Delivery Period, and all of the electricity delivered by the Commodity Supplier during the Electricity Delivery Period. In each case on a pay-as-you-go basis and that Contract provides flexibility in the Commodity Supply Contract which includes specified amounts. The amounts payable by the Project Participant will provide sufficient revenues to cover swap payments and receipts, and subsequently income from the Debt Service Account to make the required scheduled deposits to the Debt Service Account.

6. **Commodity Swaps:** During the Gas Delivery Period, NCEA will pay and receive fixed amounts from the Commodity Swap Counterparty against the payment obligations per the contract which includes fixed revenues available to meet its fixed debt service obligations. The Commodity Supplier will enter into a mirror swap with the same Commodity Swap Counterparty to meet its requirements for market-referenced pricing to fulfill its delivery obligations.

# OFFICIAL STATEMENT

**$000,000,000***

**NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY**  
**COMMODITY SUPPLY REVENUE REFUNDING BONDS, SERIES 2024**

## INTRODUCTION

This Official Statement, which includes the cover page and appendices attached hereto, contains information concerning (a) Northern California Energy Authority (“NCEA”), a joint powers authority organized under the laws of the State of California (the “State”), (b) NCEA’s Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”), being issued in the aggregate principal amount of $000,000,000* and (c) the Commodity Project (defined below) being financed with proceeds of the Bonds. Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings shown in APPENDIX C.

## NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY

The Northern California Energy Authority (“NCEA”) is a joint powers authority formed pursuant to Chapter 5 of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code of the State of California, as amended and supplemented (the “Act”), by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority (“SFA”). NCEA is authorized to undertake all actions permitted by the Act that are necessary or convenient to assist SMUD with the acquisition and financing of supplies of natural gas and electricity, including undertaking the Commodity Project and selling the Commodity Project to SMUD, as described herein. See “NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY.”

## THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT

SMUD operates the sixth largest community-owned electric utility system in the United States. SMUD’s electric system has provided retail electric service since 1946, and it currently serves a population of approximately 1.5 million persons in a 900 square mile service area that covers the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. See APPENDIX B for additional information regarding SMUD.

## THE COMMODITY PROJECT

NCEA previously issued its Commodity Supply Revenue Bonds, Series 2018 (the “2018 Bonds”), pursuant to a Trust Indenture (the “2018 Indenture”) between NCEA and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, to finance the acquisition of an approximately thirty-year supply of natural gas and electricity (together, the “Commodities”) under a Prepaid Commodity Sales Agreement (the “2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement”) with J. Aron & Company LLC, a New York limited liability company (“J. Aron”). Deliveries of natural gas under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement began on June 1, 2019. NCEA entered

* Preliminary, subject to change.
<!-- Page 556 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

into a Commodity Supply Contract (the “2018 Commodity Supply Contract”) with the Project Participant for the sale of all of the Commodities to be delivered under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement.

The 2018 Bonds mature and are subject to mandatory tender for purchase on July 1, 2024, and a portion of the proceeds of the Bonds will be used to current refund the 2018 Bonds. See “PLAN OF REFUNDING.” Effective as of the Initial Issue Date of the Bonds: (a) J. Aron will transfer by novation of all its interests under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement and its other contracts and agreements related to the 2018 prepayment transaction to Aron Energy Prepay 33 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Commodity Supplier”); (b) in consideration of a lump sum payment for its acceptance of the obligations under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement and such other contracts and agreements, the Commodity Supplier will accept such transfer by novation from J. Aron; (c) NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will enter into an Amended & Restated Prepaid Commodity Sales Agreement (the “Commodity Purchase Agreement”), together with amendments and restatements of various other contracts and agreements entered into in connection with the 2018 prepayment transaction; (d) NCEA will make a prepayment to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement for additional quantities of Commodities to be delivered through September 2054; and (e) NCEA and the Project Participant will enter into an Amended & Restated Commodity Supply Contract (as so amended and restated, the “Commodity Supply Contract”) to provide for the purchase and sale of additional quantities of Commodities through September 2054.

Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier will continue to deliver natural gas until NCEA exercises its option to switch from gas deliveries to electricity deliveries (the “Gas Delivery Period”). The switch from gas deliveries to electricity deliveries will occur on a date (the “Switch Date”) determined pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement, but may not occur prior to June 1, 2028. Scheduled deliveries of electricity under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will commence on the Switch Date and will continue to the end of the delivery period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (the “Electricity Delivery Period”). The “Commodity Project” consists of NCEA’s purchase of natural gas and electricity pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement and all of its related contractual arrangements and agreements. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT.”

The Project Participant uses the natural gas that is now being delivered during the Gas Delivery Period as fuel for the generation of electricity that is distributed and sold to retail customers within its service area. If the Switch Date occurs, the Project Participant will distribute and sell the electricity that will be delivered during the Electricity Delivery Period to retail customers within its service area. See “THE COMMODITY SUPPLY CONTRACT.”

PLAN OF REFUNDING
Proceeds of the Bonds together with other available moneys will be deposited with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to an Escrow Agreement to establish an irrevocable trust escrow account (the “Escrow Account”), consisting of cash and noncallable direct full faith and credit obligations of the United States of America. The amounts in the Escrow Account will be used to refund the $537,295,000 principal amount of 2018 Bonds maturing on and after July 1, 2024 (the “Refunded Bonds”), and are pledged solely for the payment of the Refunded Bonds. Upon the deposit of such amounts and satisfaction of certain requirements of the 2018 Indenture, the Refunded Bonds will be deemed to be paid and will no longer be secured by the pledge of the Trust Estate under the 2018 Indenture. The Refunded Bonds will be called for redemption on July 1, 2024. See “PLAN OF REFUNDING” below.
<!-- Page 557 -->
# THE BONDS

From their Initial Issue Date to and including __________, 20__ (the “Interest Rate Reset Period”), the Bonds will bear interest in a Fixed Rate Period, with interest payable semiannually on each [January 1] and [July 1], commencing __________, 20__*, as described herein.

The Bonds are subject to optional redemption and extraordinary mandatory redemption during the Interest Rate Reset Period, and the Bonds maturing on __________, 20__* are required to be tendered for purchase on __________, 20__* (the “Mandatory Purchase Date”), which is the day following the end of the Interest Rate Reset Period. The Purchase Price of Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date is equal to the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest. See “THE BONDS—Redemption” and “—Tender—Mandatory Tender.” Under the Indenture, a “Failed Remarketing” will occur upon the failure (a) of the Trustee to receive the Purchase Price of any Bond required to be purchased or redeemed on a Mandatory Purchase Date by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the fifth Business Day preceding such Mandatory Purchase Date or (b) to purchase or redeem such Bond in whole by such Mandatory Purchase Date. A Failed Remarketing will result in early termination of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the extraordinary redemption of the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date. See “THE BONDS—Redemption” and “—Tender.”

# SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

The Bonds are issued pursuant to the authority contained in the Act, and are issued and secured under an Amended and Restated Trust Indenture, dated as of the first day of the month in which the Bonds are issued (the “Indenture”), between NCEA and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association), as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Bonds are special and limited obligations of NCEA, are payable solely from and secured solely by the Trust Estate pledged by the Indenture, and are expected to be paid from the Revenues of the Commodity Project. See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS.”

# THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT

## Delivery of Commodities. 
Pursuant to the terms and conditions and subject to the limitations set forth in the Commodity Purchase Agreement:

(a) on each gas day during the Gas Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver and NCEA agrees to take, in each case on a firm basis, the Contract Quantity of gas;

(b) during each hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver and NCEA agrees to take, in each case on a firm basis, the Contract Quantity of electricity; and

(c) during each Month of the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver and NCEA agrees to purchase and take, the Assigned Prepay Quantity of electricity, if any.

“Contract Quantity” is defined in the Commodity Purchase Agreement to mean: (a) during the Gas Delivery Period for each gas day and each gas delivery point, the daily quantity of gas (in MMBtu) specified for such

* Preliminary, subject to change. 

-3-
<!-- Page 558 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

delivery point for the Month in which such gas day occurs: and (b) during the Electricity Delivery Period, (i) the specified Hourly Quantity of electricity for each hour and each electricity delivery point and (ii) the Assigned Prepay Quantity, if any, of Assigned Electricity for each Month. The delivery points designated in the Commodity Purchase Agreement are located on the natural gas pipelines and electricity transmission lines that serve the Project Participant.

**Switch Date.** On June 1, 2028 or such later date as may be established pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement (the “Switch Date”), deliveries of gas under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will cease, and the Electricity Delivery Period and deliveries of electricity will commence.

**Assigned Electricity.** From and after the Switch Date, the Project Participant may enter into assignment agreements (“PPA Assignment Agreements”) to assign a portion of its rights and obligations (the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”) under power purchase agreements (“Assigned PPAs”) to J. Aron. If such assignments are accepted by J. Aron, the electricity delivered under the Assigned PPAs (the “Assigned Electricity”) will be delivered to J. Aron for sale to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. The monthly quantities of Assigned Electricity that are allocated to the prepayment transaction pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Commodity Supply Contract (the “Assigned Prepay Quantities”) will offset (on an equivalent value basis), and will be used to meet, the Commodity Supplier’s obligations to deliver the Hourly Quantity of electricity to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. NCEA will then deliver such Assigned Prepaid Quantities to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract.

**Commodity Remarketing, Ledger Event and Additional Interest.** Under the circumstances described in the Commodity Purchase Agreement and during the Gas Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier agrees to remarket, on a daily or monthly basis, all or such portion of the Contract Quantity of gas as is designated by NCEA or the Trustee. In the event that the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket any such gas, the Commodity Supplier has agreed to purchase such gas for its own account. During the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier further agrees to remarket or purchase all or such portion of the Hourly Quantity of electricity as is designated by NCEA or the Trustee, and may agree to remarket Assigned Electricity upon mutual agreement with NCEA.

Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (described below), J. Aron has agreed to provide all Commodity marketing services necessary for the Commodity Supplier to meet its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. These services include requirements to (a) enter all remarketing sales or purchases of Commodities on a ledger system that tracks compliance with the requirements of the U.S. Treasury Regulations applicable to tax-exempt bonds that finance prepaid natural gas and electricity supplies, and (b) exercise commercially reasonable efforts to remediate any non-complying sales (i.e., non-qualified use sales and private business use sales) through “qualifying use” sales within two years.

In the event that any non-complying Commodities remarketing sales are not remediated within two years and exceed certain cumulative limits, a “Ledger Event” will occur, subject to certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If a Ledger Event occurs, and an Early Termination Payment Date has not been designated, J. Aron will be obligated to pay the Commodity Supplier, and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay NCEA, scheduled amounts (the “Ledger Event Payments”) calculated to provide a sum sufficient (together with the interest component of the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits) to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate of 8.00% per annum. The Indenture provides that, subject to NCEA’s receipt of such Ledger Event Payments from the Commodity Supplier, interest on the Bonds will be -4-

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

**Commodity Delivery Termination Events.** A Commodity Delivery Termination Date (a) will occur automatically under the Commodity Purchase Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events (“Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Events”), and (b) may be designated at the option of the Commodity Supplier upon the occurrence of a Ledger Event and certain other events (“Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Events”). Certain of these Commodity Delivery Termination Events also constitute Termination Payment Events under the Commodity Purchase Agreement as described below.

If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs, the Delivery Period for Commodities under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will end and the Commodity Supplier will be required:

(a) in the case of a Commodity Delivery Termination Event that is a Termination Payment Event, to pay a scheduled termination payment (the “Termination Payment”) to the Trustee on the last Business Day of the Month following the Month in which the Termination Payment Event or, in the case of a Termination Payment Event due to a Failed Remarketing, on the last Business Day of the then-current Interest Rate Period (in either case, the “Early Termination Payment”); or

(b) in the case of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date that is not a Termination Payment Event, to pay scheduled monthly amounts to NCEA until the earlier of (i) the Month in which a Termination Payment Event occurs or (ii) the last date for such scheduled payments.

**Termination Payment Events.** The Commodity Delivery Termination Events that constitute a Termination Payment Event are described under the caption “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Early Termination” below, and include: (a) a failure of the Commodity Supplier to pay any amounts owed to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement because of a failure by [__________] (the “Funding Recipient”) to pay when due any amounts owed to the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Funding Agreement (defined below) and such failure continues for 30 days after receipt by the Commodity Supplier and the Funding Recipient of notice thereof from NCEA; and (b) [exercise of Funding Recipient/Commodity Supplier Acceleration Option(s)].

If an Early Termination Payment Date occurs, the Bonds will be subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole on the first day of the following Month. The amount of the Termination Payment declines over time as the Commodity Supplier performs its Commodities delivery obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The amount of the Termination Payment, together with the amounts required to be on deposit in certain Funds and Accounts held by the Trustee, has been calculated to provide a sum at least sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of the Bonds, assuming that the Commodity Supplier, the Funding Recipient, the Investment Agreement Providers and the Project Participant pay and perform their respective contract obligations when due. A performance shortfall from any one of these entities could result in a payment shortfall to Bondholders.

If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs that is not a Termination Payment Event, an Early Termination Payment Date will not occur under the Commodity Purchase Agreement until the earlier of (a) the
<!-- Page 560 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

occurrence of a Termination Payment Event or (b) the end of the Interest Rate Reset Period. In the event that the Funding Recipient does not exercise its option to prepay the Final Payment Amount, the scheduled monthly amounts required to be paid by the Commodity Supplier will be applied to make the debt service payments on the Bonds. The use of these scheduled payments (in lieu of payments made by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract) to make debt service payments could, under certain circumstances, adversely affect the continued tax-exempt status of the Bonds. See “INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS—Loss of Tax Exemption on the Bonds.”

See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT” and “THE BONDS—Redemption—Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption.” A schedule of the Termination Payment as of specified Early Termination Payment Dates under the Commodity Purchase Agreement during the Interest Rate Reset Period is attached as APPENDIX I.

THE FUNDING AGREEMENT

[to be revised/conformed]

The Commodity Supplier will use proceeds from the prepayment it receives from NCEA to purchase a Funding Agreement (the “Funding Agreement”) from the Funding Recipient. Such amount will be deposited into the “Funding Account” established under the Funding Agreement and will earn a fixed rate of interest. The Funding Agreement will mature by its terms on the Business Day preceding the Mandatory Purchase Date of the Bonds (the “Maturity Date”) unless terminated earlier. The Funding Agreement provides for monthly withdrawals of scheduled amounts (the “Scheduled Withdrawals”) from the Funding Account, including a final Scheduled Withdrawal of the unamortized balance of the Funding Account on the Maturity Date or any earlier termination date of the Funding Agreement. For a summary of certain provisions of the Funding Agreement, see “THE FUNDING AGREEMENT.” For certain information regarding [____], see APPENDIX J.

The monthly Scheduled Withdrawals provide amounts sufficient to enable the Commodity Supplier to meet its payment obligations (other than those in respect of the Receivables Purchase Provisions) under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap.

The ability of the Commodity Supplier to meet its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap will directly and materially depend upon full and timely performance by the Funding Recipient under the Funding Agreement. Any failure by the Funding Recipient to timely pay the Scheduled Withdrawals or the Final Payment Amount when due under the Funding Agreement will result in an inability of the Commodity Supplier to meet its contract obligations to NCEA and a shortfall in the amounts necessary for NCEA to pay the principal, interest, Redemption Price and purchase price due on the Bonds. The Funding Agreement is an unsecured obligation of the Funding Recipient. See “INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS—Performance by Others.”

THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT

Under a Commodity Purchase, Sale and Service Agreement (the “Commodity Sale and Service Agreement”) between J. Aron and the Commodity Supplier, J. Aron has agreed to sell Commodities to the
<!-- Page 561 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

Commodity Supplier on a pay-as-you-go basis in the quantities and at the delivery points necessary to enable the Commodity Supplier to meet its commodity delivery obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. J. Aron is obligated to make payments to the Commodity Supplier for Commodities not delivered or taken under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement for any reason, including force majeure events. J. Aron has also agreed to remarket Commodities and make payments to the Commodity Supplier that enable it to meet its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. J. Aron is appointed as the Commodity Supplier’s agent for taking all actions that the Commodity Supplier is required or permitted to take under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Re-Pricing Agreement and, with respect to ordinary course transactions, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. J. Aron’s commodity delivery, payment, remarketing and receivables purchase obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement mirror the Commodity Supplier’s obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Commodity Supplier may net any amounts due and owing to it by J. Aron against its monthly payments to J. Aron, but J. Aron is not entitled to net any amounts due and owing to it against its monthly payments to the Commodity Supplier.

The payment obligations of J. Aron to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by GSG. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT.”

THE COMMODITY SUPPLY CONTRACT

Gas deliveries began under the 2018 Commodity Supply Contract on June 1, 2019. The Commodity Supply Contract provides for the sale to the Project Participant, on a pay-as-you-go basis, of all of the Commodities to be delivered to NCEA over the term of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. Under the Commodity Supply Contract, NCEA has agreed to deliver, and the Project Participant has agreed to purchase, the specified Contract Quantities of gas at designated delivery points during the Gas Delivery Period and the specified Hourly Quantities of electricity at designated delivery points during the Electricity Delivery Period. The Project Participant is obligated to pay NCEA for the quantities of Commodities delivered under the Commodity Supply Contract, including contracted quantities tendered for delivery by NCEA but not taken by the Project Participant (for which the Project Participant is eligible to receive a credit based on revenues received for the remarketed Commodities under certain circumstances described in such Commodity Supply Contract). The Project Participant has no obligation to pay for Commodities that NCEA fails to deliver. The Commodities sold under the Commodity Supply Contract are priced at the applicable “Contract Price,” which (a) in the case of the Contract Quantity of gas, is the applicable monthly market index price for the gas delivery point plus any applicable delivery point premium and (b) in the case of the Hourly Quantity of electricity, is the day-ahead market price for the electricity delivery point, in each case less a specified discount.

In addition to the provisions with respect to Assigned PPAs described above (see “The Commodity Purchase Agreement—Assigned Electricity”), the Commodity Supply Contract includes provisions that enable the Project Participant to enter into assignment agreements (“Gas Assignment Agreements”) to assign upstream gas supply contracts (“Upstream Supply Contracts”) to J. Aron during the Gas Delivery Period. If such assignments are accepted by J. Aron, the assigned quantities of gas (the “Assigned Gas Quantities”) under the Upstream Supply Contracts will be delivered to J. Aron for sale to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, and will be used to meet the Commodity Supplier’s obligations to deliver the Contract Quantity of gas to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and the Commodity Swaps contain various provisions and adjustments that accommodate the assignment of Upstream Supply Contracts and Assigned PPAs.
<!-- Page 562 -->
Payments made by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract are paid to NCEA for deposit into the Revenue Fund. The required payments under the Commodity Supply Contract, together with any net amounts received by NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap described below, constitute the primary and expected sources of the revenues pledged to the payment of the Bonds. The obligations of the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract are payable solely from the revenues of its electric system. Under the Commodity Supply Contract, the Project Participant makes payments directly to the Trustee for deposit into the Revenue Fund. See “THE COMMODITY SUPPLY CONTRACT.”

THE COMMODITY SWAPS

Upon the execution of the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement, NCEA and J. Aron entered into commodity price swap agreements with RBC Europe Limited (“RBCEL”), as commodity swap counterparty. Under these swap agreements and during the Gas Delivery Period under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement: (a) NCEA pays an index (floating) natural gas price and receives a fixed natural gas price for notional quantities of natural gas at delivery points that correspond to the quantities and related delivery points under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement; and (b) J. Aron pays a fixed natural gas price and receives a floating natural gas price at the same pricing points for the same notional quantities, also corresponding to the quantities and related delivery points under the 2018 Commodity Purchase Agreement.

Effective as of the Initial Issue Date:

(a) NCEA’s 2018 swap agreement will be amended and restated to (i) replace RBCEL with Royal Bank of Canada (“Royal Bank”) as the Commodity Swap Counterparty (by novation), and (ii) include notional quantities of natural gas with respect to the additional quantities of gas to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement; (as so novated, amended and restated, the “NCEA Commodity Swap”);

(b) J. Aron will novate and transfer all of its interests under its 2018 swap agreement to the Commodity Supplier and such 2018 swap agreement will be amended and restated to (i) replace RBCEL with Royal Bank as the Commodity Swap Counterparty (by novation), and (ii) include notional quantities of natural gas with respect to the additional quantities of gas to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (as so novated, amended and restated, the “Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap”); and

(c) The Commodity Supplier will enter into a Custodial Agreement with the Commodity Swap Counterparty and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee and as custodian (in such capacity, the “Custodian”), to administer payments under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap. NCEA will enter into a Custodial Agreement (the “NCEA Custodial Agreement” and, together with the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement, the “Custodial Agreements”), with the Commodity Swap Counterparty, the Trustee and the Custodian, to administer payments under the NCEA Commodity Swap. See “THE COMMODITY SWAPS—Custodial Agreement.”

During the Gas Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement: (a) under the NCEA Commodity Swap, NCEA pays a floating price to Royal Bank and receives a fixed price from Royal Bank for notional quantities that correspond to the Contract Quantity of gas and pricing points under the Commodity Purchase Agreement; and (b) under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Supplier pays
<!-- Page 563 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
a fixed price to Royal Bank and receives floating price from Royal Bank for the same notional quantities at the same pricing points. During the Electricity Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement: (a) under the NCEA Commodity Swap, NCEA pays a floating price based on the day-ahead market price of electricity to Royal Bank and receives a fixed price from Royal Bank for notional quantities that correspond to the Hourly Quantity of electricity and pricing points under the Commodity Purchase Agreement; and (b) under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Supplier pays a fixed price to Royal Bank and receives floating price from Royal Bank for the same notional quantities at the same pricing points. The notional quantities under the Commodity Swaps will be reduced to the extent of gas quantities delivered under fixed price Upstream Supply Contracts during the Gas Delivery Period and to the extent of electricity deliveries under fixed price Assigned PPAs during the Electricity Delivery Period.

The NCEA Commodity Swap and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (together, the “Commodity Swaps”) have rolling two-month terms that renew automatically upon the payment due date of each monthly net settlement amount due thereunder through the term of the Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, unless an early termination date occurs under the Commodity Swaps. Each of the Commodity Swaps is subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events as described herein, including upon a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY SWAPS” and “THE COMMODITY SWAP COUNTERPARTY.”

DEBT SERVICE AND COMMODITY SWAP RESERVES

The Indenture establishes funding reserves for various funds and accounts, including the Debt Service Account, the Debt Service Reserve Account and the Commodity Swap Reserve Account. Scheduled Debt Service Deposits are required to be made monthly into the Debt Service Account in amounts equal to the accrued debt service on the Bonds. It is expected that the Debt Service Account, the Debt Service Reserve Account and the Commodity Swap Reserve Account will be invested pursuant to the Investment Agreements described herein. The providers of the Investment Agreements (the “Investment Agreement Providers”) are required to meet certain qualifications specified in the Indenture and will be selected on the date of Bond pricing pursuant to a competitive bidding process. See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS—Investment of Funds.”

The Debt Service Reserve Account and the Commodity Swap Reserve Account provide reserves for debt service deposits and payments under the NCEA Commodity Swap in the event of payment defaults by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract. The Debt Service Reserve Requirement is $________, which approximately equals the maximum monthly Scheduled Debt Service Deposit during the Interest Rate Reset Period. The Minimum Amount required to be on deposit in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account is approximately $________. The Debt Service Reserve Requirement and the Minimum Amount are sufficient to cover payment defaults by the Project Participant for two months of maximum natural gas deliveries during the Interest Rate Reset Period at a monthly market gas index price of approximately $______/MMBtu*. The monthly market index prices of the gas for delivery under the Commodity Supply Contract in the month of [________] is $______/MMBtu.

# RECEIVABLES PURCHASE PROVISIONS

**Swap Call Receivables.** If a payment default by the Project Participant results in a deficiency of the funds necessary to pay amounts due under the NCEA Commodity Swap (a “Swap Payment Deficiency”), the Commodity Supplier has the option under the Receivables Purchase Provisions to purchase from the Trustee the rights to payment of net amounts owed by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract (“Swap Call Receivables”) in an amount sufficient to fund the Swap Payment Deficiency. The failure of the Commodity Supplier to exercise its option to purchase Swap Call Receivables is an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Receivables Purchase Provisions.”

**Elective Call Receivables.** If the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under its Commodity Supply Contract and such payment default does not result in a Swap Payment Deficiency, the Commodity Supplier has the option under the Receivables Purchase Provisions to purchase from the Trustee the receivables relating to such payment default (the “Elective Call Receivables” and, together with the Swap Call Receivables, “Call Receivables”). The Commodity Supplier may elect, in its discretion, to purchase the Elective Call Receivables at any time. The failure of the Commodity Supplier to not make such election does not constitute an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Receivables Purchase Provisions” herein.

**Purchase by J. Aron.** Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, J. Aron has agreed to purchase all Receivables purchased by the Commodity Supplier under the Receivables Purchase Provisions, provided that such obligation is subject to J. Aron having consented to the purchase of such Call Receivables by the Commodity Supplier. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT.”

# RE-PRICING PROVISIONS

On the Initial Issue Date of the Bonds, NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will enter into an Amended and Restated Re-Pricing Agreement (the “Re-Pricing Agreement”), which provides for (a) the determination of Commodity delivery periods (“Reset Periods”) subsequent to the Reset Period that corresponds to the Interest Rate Reset Period on the Bonds and (b) the calculation of the amount of the discount (in cents per MMBtu or in dollars per MWh, as applicable) from the Contract Price of the Commodities that is available (the “Available Discount”) for sales of Commodities to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract during each Reset Period.

The Reset Period that corresponds to the Interest Rate Reset Period on the Bonds begins on __________ and ends on the last day of __________, and the next Reset Period is expected to begin on __________. In the event that the Available Discount for any Reset Period is less than the minimum discount specified in the Commodity Supply Contract (which includes both monthly discounts and any annual refunds), the Project Participant may elect not to take Commodities during the Reset Period and to have the Commodities remarketed for the duration of the Reset Period (a “Remarketing Election”) by giving notice of such election to NCEA. Any Commodity that is covered by a Remarketing Election will be remarketed in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event that the Project Participant makes a Remarketing Election with respect to such Reset Period, J. Aron will have the right, but not the obligation, to designate a CSSA Early Termination Date under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, which designation is a Termination Payment Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE RE-”

<!-- Page 567 -->
# STRUCTURE OF THE COMMODITY PROJECT

The expected and intended source of the Revenues and other amounts to be used to pay the debt service on the Bonds are (a) the amounts payable by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, (b) any net amounts payable to NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap and (c) the principal amounts payable by the Investment Agreement Provider for the Debt Service Account. The Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract, the Investment Agreements, the Commodity Swaps, the Indenture, the Bonds and related agreements have been structured so that, assuming timely performance and payment by the Funding Recipient, GSG (as the guarantor of J. Aron’s payment obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement), the Investment Agreement Providers and the Project Participant of their respective contract obligations, the Revenues (defined herein) available to NCEA from the Commodity Project are calculated to be sufficient at all times to provide for the timely payment of the scheduled Debt Service requirements on the Bonds and the amounts due by NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap and the other Operating Expenses of the Commodity Project. These arrangements include:

- The Commodity Supplier is required to deliver Commodities under the Commodity Purchase Agreement in specified quantities at designated delivery points that correspond to the quantities of Commodities and delivery points that NCEA has committed to serve under the Commodity Supply Contract. In the event the Commodity Supplier fails to deliver the Commodities for any reason, including force majeure events, it is required to pay specified amounts to NCEA. In the event that the Assigned Gas Quantity or the Assigned Prepay Quantity is not delivered or taken under an Upstream Supply Contract or an Assigned PPA, NCEA is deemed to have requested that the Commodity Supplier remarket such assigned quantity, and the Commodity Supplier is required to pay specified amounts to NCEA.

- J. Aron is required to sell and deliver Commodities under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement in specified quantities at designated delivery points that correspond to the quantities of Commodities and the delivery points that the Commodity Supplier has committed to serve under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event J. Aron fails to deliver such Commodities for any reason, including force majeure events, it is required to pay certain specified amounts to the Commodity Supplier. The Commodity Supplier may not any amounts due and owing to it by J. Aron against its monthly payments to J. Aron, but J. Aron is not entitled to net any amounts due and owing to it against its monthly payments to the Commodity Supplier.

- The Scheduled Withdrawal Amounts required to be paid by the Funding Recipient under the Funding Agreement will provide the Commodity Supplier with amounts sufficient to make the payments it is required to make to J. Aron under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and any net amounts due to the Commodity Swap Counterparty under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap.

- The Project Participant has agreed to pay for Commodities tendered for delivery under the Commodity Supply Contract at the applicable Contract Price, and to pay specified damages to NCEA for a failure to accept Commodities tendered for delivery by NCEA, subject to the terms of the Commodity Supply Contract and the provisions with respect to a failure to take the Assigned Gas Quantity or the Assigned Prepay Quantity.

-13-
<!-- Page 568 -->
- In the event that the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed under the Commodity Supply Contract (whether for Commodities taken or damages for Commodities tendered but not taken), NCEA has covenanted in the Indenture to exercise its right under the Commodity Supply Contract to suspend further deliveries of Commodities to the Project Participant.

- In the event of a suspension of Commodity deliveries, J. Aron will remarket such quantities of Commodities pursuant to the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement in compliance with the requirements of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Commodity Purchase Agreement requires specified payments for all Commodities remarketed or purchased, less certain applicable fees.

- In the event that any non-complying remarketing sales of Commodities are not remediated within two years and exceed certain cumulative limits, a Ledger Event will occur, subject to certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If a Ledger Event occurs, J. Aron will be obligated to pay the Commodity Supplier, and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay NCEA, scheduled Ledger Event Payments calculated to provide a sum sufficient (together with the interest component of the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits) to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate of 8.00% per annum. The Indenture provides that, subject to NCEA’s receipt of such Ledger Event Payments from the Commodity Supplier, interest on the Bonds will be paid at the Increased Interest Rate after the occurrence of a Ledger Event.

- If the Commodity Swap Counterparty does not make a required payment under the NCEA Commodity Swap and such payment remains unpaid after the expiration of any grace period, the Custodian under the terms of the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement will pay the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (or in the event of termination of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid into the custodial account as if the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap were still in effect), which such amount is held in custody, to NCEA, and such payment will be treated as a Commodity Swap Receipt for purposes of the Indenture.

- If the Commodity Swap Counterparty does not make a required payment under the NCEA Commodity Swap and such payment remains unpaid after the expiration of any grace period, the Custodian under the terms of the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement will pay the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (or in the event of termination of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid into the custodial account as if the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap were still in effect), which such amount is held in custody, to NCEA, and such payment will be treated as a Commodity Swap Receipt.

- If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay scheduled monthly amounts to NCEA in lieu of Commodity deliveries, which amounts are sufficient to enable NCEA to make the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits required by the Indenture.
<!-- Page 569 -->
- If an [Event of Default] occurs under the Funding Agreement, the Funding Recipient is required to pay the [Final Payment Amount] to the Commodity Supplier.

- If a Termination Payment Event occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay the scheduled Termination Payment to the Trustee.

- The amounts required to be paid by the Investment Agreement Providers under the Investment Agreements will, together with the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits and the other amounts required to be deposited into the Debt Service Account, provide sufficient monies to NCEA to pay debt service.

**PERFORMANCE BY OTHERS**

The ability of NCEA to pay timely the scheduled debt service on the Bonds depends on the timely performance and payment by (a) the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, (b) the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract and (c) the Investment Agreement Providers under the Investment Agreements. The failure by any one or more of such parties to meet such obligations could materially and adversely affect the ability of NCEA to pay timely the scheduled debt service on the Bonds, and to meet its other obligations under the Indenture, the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract and the NCEA Commodity Swap.

The ability of the Commodity Supplier to meet its performance and payment obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and the Commodity Swap will depend directly and materially on timely payment by the Funding Recipient of the scheduled payments due under the Funding Agreement and on timely payment and performance by J. Aron of its obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. The failure by the Funding Recipient or J. Aron to meet such obligations would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Commodity Supplier to meet its contract obligations to NCEA and, in turn, the ability of NCEA to meet its contract obligations to the Project Participant. The failure by the Funding Recipient to meet such obligations would materially and adversely affect the ability of NCEA to pay timely the scheduled debt service on the Bonds.

The events and conditions that could result in a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds, include items that may be within or outside the control of NCEA or the Commodity Supplier (or both), such as:

- failure by the Funding Recipient to make timely payment of the scheduled amounts due under the Funding Agreement would result in an Early Termination Payment Event and a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds;

- failure by the Project Participant in the timely payment of the amounts due under the Commodity Supply Agreement could result in a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds if such non-payments exceed the amount on deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Account;

- failure by an Investment Agreement Provider to make timely payment of the required amounts due or payable under the Investment Agreements, including upon non-payment by the Project.
<!-- Page 570 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Page)  
Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, could result in a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds; and and  
• failure by the Commodity Swap Counterparty to make timely payment of the amounts due under the NCEA Commodity Swap coupled with a failure in the timely performance and enforcement of the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap could result in a default in the payment of debt service on the Bonds.  

The Commodity Purchase Agreement will terminate automatically upon the occurrence of a Termination Payment Event. If a Termination Payment Event occurs during the Initial Interest Rate Period (a) the Funding Recipient will be obligated to pay to the Commodity Supplier the final [Scheduled Withdrawal] due under the Funding Agreement, (b) the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay the scheduled Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date, and (c) the Bonds will be subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption.  

The scheduled amount of the Termination Payment, together with the amounts required to be on deposit in certain Funds and Accounts held by the Trustee, has been calculated to provide NCEA with an amount at least sufficient to redeem all of the Bonds, assuming that the Commodity Supplier, the Funding Recipient and the Investment Agreement Providers pay and perform their respective contract obligations when due. If the Termination Payment becomes payable, the Bonds are to be redeemed at their Amortized Value, regardless of reinvestment rates at the time. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Early Termination” and “THE BONDS—Redemption—Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption.”  

COMMODITY REMARKETING  

If the Project Participant does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Commodities that it is obligated to purchase under the Commodity Supply Contract as a result of decreased gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period or decreased demand by the Project Participant’s retail customers or for other reasons permitting remarketing thereunder, it may request that NCEA arrange for the Commodity Supplier to remarket such Commodity. Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier has agreed, upon written notice from NCEA or the Trustee, to use commercially reasonable efforts to remarket or cause to be remarked on, a daily or monthly basis, such amounts of Commodities as are identified by NCEA, including Commodities that are covered by a Remarketing Election given by the Project Participant with respect to a Reset Period. In the event that the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket all or any portion of such Commodity, the Commodity Supplier will purchase the Commodity for its own account.  

The Commodity Supplier has agreed to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remarket the Commodities to Municipal Utilities pursuant to provisions that are intended to maintain the tax-exempt status of interest on the Bonds (“Qualified Sales”), but, if the Commodity Supplier cannot do so, the Commodity Supplier is also permitted to remarket such Commodity to other governmental entities in non-private business sales (“Non-Private Business Sales”), although it is not required to remarket Commodities at a price that is less than the minimum remarketing price specified in the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket Commodity in Qualified Sales or Non-Private Business Sales, it must purchase the Commodity for its own account (a private business use sale). Under certain circumstances and upon reaching certain thresholds that are not timely remediated, the remarketing of Commodities to entities other than  
-16-
<!-- Page 571 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

Municipal Utilities and the purchase of Commodities by the Commodity Supplier could result in a Ledger Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

The Commodity Supplier will depend upon performance by J. Aron under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to meet its commodity remarketing obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, including particularly the ability of J. Aron to remarket Commodities in Qualified Sales to Municipal Utilities and to remediate any non-complying sales in order avoid the occurrence of a Ledger Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event that any non-complying remarketing sales of Commodities are not remediated within two years and exceed certain cumulative limits, a Ledger Event will occur, subject to certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

The occurrence of a Ledger Event [provides the Commodity Supplier with the option to designate a Commodity Delivery Termination Date, and provides the Funding Recipient with the option to exercise the Funding Recipient Acceleration Option] which, if exercised, would result in a Termination Payment Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and a mandatory redemption of the Bonds. If a Ledger Event occurs, and [ ] does not exercise the [ ] Acceleration Option, J. Aron will be obligated to pay the Commodity Supplier, and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay NCEA, scheduled Ledger Event Payments calculated to provide a sum sufficient to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate of 8.00% per annum. The Indenture provides that, subject to NCEA’s receipt of such Ledger Event Payments from the Commodity Supplier, interest on the Bonds will be paid at the Increased Interest Rate after the occurrence of a Ledger Event. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing” and “—Ledger Event Payments,” and “THE BONDS—Increased Interest Rate Upon Ledger Event.”

The Commodity Project will deliver an average of [ ] million MMBtu of natural gas each year to the Project Participant during the Gas Delivery Period [and is expected to deliver [ ] MWh of electricity each year to the Project Participant during the Electricity Delivery Period]. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodities Remarketing.”

LIMITATIONS ON EXERCISE OF REMEDIES

The remedies available to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement are limited to those described herein. NCEA has no rights to enforce the provisions of the Funding Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement or the related CSSA Guaranty (defined below) provided to the Commodity Supplier. Neither the Trustee nor the Bondholders have any rights to enforce the Funding Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement or the CSSA Guaranty. See “GSG, J. ARON AND THE COMMODITY SUPPLIER—The Commodity Supplier—Organization” for a description of certain consent and voting rights of the director appointed by NCEA to the Commodity Supplier’s board of directors and related covenants of NCEA.

The remedies available to the Trustee, NCEA and the Holders of the Bonds upon an Event of Default under the Indenture are in many respects dependent upon judicial actions which are often subject to discretion and delay. Under existing constitutional and statutory provisions and judicial decisions, the remedies provided in the Indenture may not be readily available or may be limited.

-17-
<!-- Page 572 -->
![ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTS](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=ENFORCEABILITY+OF+CONTRACTS)

**ENFORCEABILITY OF CONTRACTS**

The enforceability of the various legal agreements relating to the Commodity Project may be limited by bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors or secured parties generally and by the exercise of judicial discretion in accordance with general principles of equity and by principles of equity, public policy and commercial reasonableness. The Commodity Purchase Agreement and other agreements relating to the Commodity Project are executory contracts. If NCEA or the Funding Recipient, the Commodity Supplier, J. Aron, GSG, the Commodity Swap Counterparty, the Investment Agreement Provider, the Project Participant or any of the parties with which NCEA has contracted under such agreements (including the Commodity Purchase Agreement) is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding, the relevant agreement could be discharged in return for a claim for damages against the party’s estate with uncertain value. In particular, an insolvency event with respect to the Funding Recipient that results in a delay or a reduction in the payments due under the Funding Agreement will result in insufficient amounts being available for the payment of the Bonds, whether on a Bond Payment Date, the Mandatory Tender Date or any extraordinary mandatory redemption date. In the event that NCEA is involved in an insolvency proceeding, the exercise of the remedies afforded to the Trustee under the Indenture may be stayed, and the availability of the Revenues necessary for the payment of the Bonds could be materially and adversely affected.

**NO ESTABLISHED TRADING MARKET**

The Bonds constitute a new issue with no established trading market. The Bonds have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 in reliance upon exemptions contained therein. The Underwriter has informed NCEA that it currently intends to make a market in the Bonds, the Underwriter is not obligated to do so and may discontinue any such market making at any time without notice. There can be no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any market for the Bonds. If an active public market does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Bonds may be adversely affected.

**LOSS OF TAX EXEMPTION**

As described below, the opinion of Bond Counsel with respect to the exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or the courts, and is not a guarantee of a result.

The Indenture, NCEA’s Tax Agreement with respect to the Bonds, the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Supply Contract contain various covenants and agreements on the part of NCEA, the Commodity Supplier and the Project Participant that are intended to establish and maintain the tax-exempt status of the interest on the Bonds. NCEA, the Commodity Supplier and the Project Participant have each agreed to abide by the various covenants and agreements designed to protect the tax-exempt status of the Bonds. A failure by NCEA, the Commodity Supplier and the Project Participant to comply with such covenants and agreements could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the tax-exempt status of the Bonds.

The IRS has an ongoing program of auditing tax-exempt obligations to determine whether, in the view of the IRS, interest on such tax-exempt obligations is includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. It cannot be predicted whether or not the IRS will commence an audit of the Bonds.

-18-
<!-- Page 573 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

If an audit is commenced, under current procedures the IRS may treat NCEA as a taxpayer and the Bondholders may have no right to participate in such procedure. The commencement of an audit could adversely affect the market value and liquidity of the Bonds until the audit is concluded, regardless of the ultimate outcome.

Any loss of the tax-exempt status of the Bonds could be retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds and could cause all of the interest on the Bonds to be includable in gross income for purposes of federal income taxation. The loss of the tax-exempt status of the Bonds is not a termination event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and will not result in a mandatory redemption of the Bonds. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Ledger Event” and “TAX MATTERS.”

# SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

## THE INDENTURE

The Bonds are limited obligations of NCEA payable solely from and secured solely by a pledge of and lien on the “Trust Estate,” which is defined in the Indenture as follows: (a) the proceeds of the sale of the Bonds, (b) all right, title and interest of NCEA in, to and under the Commodity Supply Contract, (c) the Revenues, (d) any Termination Payment or the right to receive such Termination Payment (subject to the Collateral Agency Agreement), (e) all right, title and interest of NCEA in, to and under the Receivables Purchase Provisions, including payments received from the Commodity Supplier pursuant thereto, (f) all right, title and interest of NCEA in, to and under each Interest Rate Swap and the Interest Rate Swap Receipts, and the Pledged Funds (but excluding Rebate Payments held in any Fund or Account), including the investment income, if any, therefrom.

assignment payment received from the Commodity Supplier, (v) any Interest Rate Swap Receipts, [(w) any Supply Administration Fee,] (x) payments received from the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Exhibit; (y) any Investment Agreement Breakage Amount payable to NCEA; and (z) any Seller Swap MTM Payment payable to NCEA. The Revenues are to be applied in accordance with the priorities established under the Indenture, including the prior payment from the Revenues of the Operating Expenses of the Commodity Project. See “— Flow of Funds” below.

The term “Operating Expenses” is defined in the Indenture to mean, to the extent properly allocable to the Commodity Project: (a) NCEA’s expenses for operation of the Commodity Project, including all Rebate Payments; Commodity Swap Payments; costs, collateral deposits and other amounts (other than Commodity Swap Payments) necessary to maintain the NCEA Commodity Swap; and payments required under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (which may, under certain circumstances, include imbalance charges and other miscellaneous payments) or required to be incurred under or in connection with the performance of NCEA’s obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract; and (b) any other current expenses or obligations required to be paid by NCEA under the provisions of the Indenture (other than Debt Service on the Bonds) or by law or required to be incurred under or in connection with the performance of NCEA’s obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract; provided that, Operating Expenses shall not include any amounts owed by NCEA under the Commodity Supply Contract with respect to purchases of replacement commodities by the Project Participant; (c) fees payable by NCEA with respect to any Remarketing Agreement for the Bonds; (d) the fees and expenses of the Fiduciaries; (e) reasonable accounting, legal and other professional fees and expenses incurred by NCEA, including but not limited to those relating to the administration of the Trust Estate and compliance by NCEA with its continuing disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to the Bonds; (f) the costs of any insurance premiums incurred by NCEA, including, without limitation, directors and officers liability insurance; and (g) fees of rating agencies necessary to maintain ratings on the Bonds.

![Flow of Funds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Flow+of+Funds)

See APPENDIX C for the meanings of certain defined terms, and see APPENDIX D for a further description of certain provisions of the Indenture.

**FLOW OF FUNDS**

All Revenues are required by the Indenture to be deposited upon receipt thereof to the credit of the Revenue Fund. Moneys must be disbursed from the Revenue Fund monthly, on or before the days and to the extent and in the manner and order set forth below:

1. First, into the Operating Fund, not later than the 25th day of such Month, the amount, if any, required so that the balance therein shall equal the amount estimated to be necessary for the payment of Commodity Swap Payments coming due for such Month and other Operating Expenses coming due for the following Month (but no such payments or expenses for any prior Month); provided that, in the event that the amount on deposit in the Operating Fund is not sufficient to pay the Commodity Swap Payments due in any Month, the amount available therein shall be applied to the payment of the amounts due under the NCEA Commodity Swap in effect;

2. Second, into the Debt Service Fund, not later than the last Business Day of such Month for the credit to the Debt Service Account an amount equal to the greater of (A) the Scheduled Debt Service Deposit, as set forth in Schedule II to the Indenture, or (B) the amount necessary to cause the cumulative Scheduled Debt Service Deposits to be on deposit therein (without credit for undisbursed Interest Rate Swap Receipts on deposit therein);

3. Third, into the Commodity Swap Reserve Account in the Project Fund, not later than the last Business Day of such Month, the amount, if any, required so that the balance in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account is at least equal to the Minimum Amount;

4. Fourth, into the Debt Service Fund, not later than the last Business Day of such Month, for deposit in the Debt Service Reserve Account, the amount, if any, required so that the balance in such Debt Service Reserve Account shall equal the Debt Service Reserve Requirement related thereto as of the last day of the then current Month; and

5. Fifth, to the Commodity Supplier, not later than the last Business Day of such Month, the amount, if any, required for the repurchase of Call Receivables and the payment of interest on all Call Receivables sold to the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Receivables Purchase Provisions.

If, after the scheduled monthly deposit to the Debt Service Account, the balance therein is below the cumulative Scheduled Debt Service Deposits for such month as specified in the Indenture, the Trustee shall (a) promptly notify NCEA of such deficiency and if the Project Participant is in default under the Commodity Supply Contract and NCEA has not previously done so, cause NCEA to suspend all deliveries of all quantities of natural gas or electricity to the Project Participant, and (b) promptly give notice to the Commodity Supplier to follow the provision set forth in the remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

On each [_____] 1, 20[__], after making such transfers, credits and deposits as described in the first paragraph of this section “Flow of Funds,” and after the applicable Principal Installment payment date, the Trustee shall credit to the General Fund the remaining balance in the Revenue Fund. See

-21-
<!-- Page 576 -->
“Revenues and Revenue Fund; Deposits of Other Amounts” and “Payments from Revenue Fund” in APPENDIX D.

As noted above, certain amounts are pledged as a part of the Trust Estate but do not constitute Revenues and are not deposited into the Revenue Fund, including (a) any Termination Payment received under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, which is to be deposited directly into the Redemption Account of the Debt Service Fund, (b) any Assignment Payment shall be deposited directly into the Assignment Payment Fund, (c) amounts received from the Commodity Supplier under the Receivables Purchase Provisions shall be deposited by the Trustee into the Commodity Swap Reserve Account as provided in the Indenture, (d) any Interest Rate Swap Receipts shall be deposited directly into the Debt Service Account, (e) any Seller Swap MTM Payment shall be deposited into the Swap Termination Account and applied as provided in the Indenture, (f) any amounts to be deposited into the Commodity Remarketing Reserve Fund shall be deposited directly therein, (g) any Additional Termination Payment shall be paid to, or upon Written Instructions provided by, NCEA, (h) Ledger Amount Payments received from the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement shall be deposited directly into the Debt Service Account, (i) any Investment Agreement Breakage Amount payable to NCEA shall be deposited into the Investment Agreement Breakage Account, and [j] amounts received from the Project Participant in respect of the Supply Administration Fee shall be remitted to NCEA.]

DEBT SERVICE ACCOUNT

The Indenture establishes a Debt Service Account, which is held by the Trustee. The amounts deposited into the Debt Service Account, including capitalized interest deposited on the Initial Issue Date, must be held in such Account and applied to the payment of Debt Service payable on the Bonds on each Bond Payment Date when due and to the payment of the Redemption Price of and accrued interest on Bonds to be redeemed on each redemption date. Amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Account will be invested pursuant to the Investment Agreement, which will permit scheduled withdrawals to pay debt service on the Bonds and, in the case of extraordinary redemption, to pay the Redemption Price without penalty or market value adjustments.

DEBT SERVICE RESERVE ACCOUNT

The Indenture establishes a Debt Service Reserve Account which is held by the Trustee. Amounts in the Debt Service Reserve Account must be applied only to (a) make the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits to the Debt Service Account when the Revenues and other available amounts are insufficient or (b) redeem or defease Bonds.

The Debt Service Reserve Requirement is $_________*, which approximately equals 200% of the maximum monthly Scheduled Debt Service Deposit to be made to the Debt Service Account during the Interest Rate Reset Period from the amounts payable by the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract. On the date of issuance of the Bonds, NCEA will deposit an amount equal to the Debt Service Reserve Requirement into the Debt Service Reserve Account, which amount will be invested pursuant to the Investment Agreement. See “ESTIMATED SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS” above. See also “—Investment Agreement” below.

* Preliminary, subject to change.  
-22-
<!-- Page 577 -->
# REDEMPTION ACCOUNT

The Indenture establishes a Redemption Account, which is held by the Trustee. On any Early Termination Payment Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier is directed to pay the Termination Payment directly to the Trustee for the account of NCEA into the Redemption Account. The Trustee will deposit the Termination Payment into the Redemption Account and will apply such amounts to the payment of the Redemption Price of the Bonds as described below under “THE BONDS—Redemption—Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption.”

# COMMODITY SWAP RESERVE ACCOUNT

The Indenture establishes a Commodity Swap Reserve Account in the Project Fund, which is held by the Trustee. NCEA will deposit in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account a portion of the proceeds in an amount equal to $ * (the “Minimum Amount”), which shall be paid from time to time by the Trustee solely to the payment of Commodity Swap Payments in the event the amounts on deposit in the Operating Fund are not sufficient to make such payments; provided, however, that (a) in the event that the amount on deposit in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account is not sufficient to pay the Commodity Swap Payments due in any Month, the amount available in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account shall be applied pro rata to the payment of the amounts due under the Commodity Swaps then in effect, (b) any amounts in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account in excess of the Minimum Amount shall be transferred to the Revenue Fund and (c) any amounts remaining on deposit in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account on the final date for payment of the principal of the Bonds, whether upon maturity, redemption or otherwise, shall be applied to make such payment. The amount deposited in the Commodity Swap Reserve Account will be invested pursuant to the Investment Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT – Receivables Purchase Provisions—Call Option” and “– Investment of Funds” below.

# NO ADDITIONAL BONDS

Other than the Bonds and any refunding bonds, no additional bonds may be issued under the Indenture.

# AMENDMENT OF INDENTURE

NCEA and the Trustee may, subject to the conditions and restrictions in the Indenture, enter into a Supplemental Indenture or Indentures without the consent of the Bondholders for certain purposes and upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. See “Supplemental Indenture Not Requiring Consent of Bondholders,” “General Provisions” and “Powers of Amendment” in APPENDIX D hereto.

# INVESTMENT OF FUNDS

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, amounts on deposit in the Funds and Accounts may be invested in, among other things, guaranteed investment contracts, forward delivery agreements or similar agreements that provide for a specified rate of return over a specified time period with providers (or their guarantors) rated at the time the investment is made at least at the same credit rating level as the Funding Recipient. See APPENDIX C—DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN TERMS and “Investment of Certain Funds” in APPENDIX D.

-23-
<!-- Page 578 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

On the Initial Issue Date of the Bonds, it is expected that the Trustee will enter into one or more investment agreements with respect to the Debt Service Account (the “Debt Service Account Investment Agreement”) and the Commodity Swap Reserve Account and the Debt Service Reserve Account (the “Reserve Accounts Investment Agreement”) and, together with the Debt Service Account Investment Agreement, the “Investment Agreements.” Each Investment Agreement will have a term coterminous with the Initial Interest Rate Period and is required to meet all of the criteria of a Qualified Investment under the Indenture. The Investment Agreements will be bid out on the day of Bond pricing to qualified investment providers.

Required qualifications for the initial Investment Agreement providers (the “Investment Agreement Providers”) include: (a) a minimum credit rating requirement for the provider (or its guarantor) of at least “[__]” from Moody’s, (b) a requirement that upon a credit rating withdrawal, suspension or downgrade of an Investment Agreement Provider (or its guarantor) below the lower of “[Baa1]” by Moody’s or the then-current credit rating of the Funding Recipient, the Investment Agreement Provider will provide a credit remedy, such as providing credit support, or NCEA will have the right to terminate the Investment Agreement and (c) a requirement that upon a credit downgrade of the provider (or its guarantor) below the lower of “[Baa3]” by Moody’s, NCEA will have the option to terminate the Investment Agreement.

If an Investment Agreement terminates, all invested funds are returned to the Trustee and a market value adjustment payment is made or received, as applicable.

Each Investment Agreement will provide for a fixed interest rate to be paid on the funds invested. The Debt Service Account Investment Agreement will provide for scheduled withdrawals in connection with each Bond Payment Date. The Reserve Accounts Investment Agreement will permit (a) withdrawals from the Commodity Swap Reserve Account to make up payment shortfalls to the Commodity Swap Counterparty, and (b) withdrawals from the Debt Service Reserve Account to cure any deficiencies in the Debt Service Account. Upon transaction termination, whether by extraordinary mandatory redemption or final maturity, the funds invested under the Investment Agreements will be used to pay the redemption price or debt service due on the Bonds.

**ENFORCEMENT OF PROJECT AGREEMENTS**

**Commodity Supply Contract.** NCEA has covenanted in the Indenture that it will enforce the provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract, as well as any other contract or contracts entered into relating to the Commodity Project, and that it will duly perform its covenants and agreements thereunder.

NCEA has also covenanted to exercise promptly its right to suspend all Commodity deliveries under the Commodity Supply Contract if the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed thereunder and to promptly give notice to the Commodity Supplier to follow the Commodity remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement for each month of such suspension with respect to the quantities of Commodities for which deliveries have been suspended.

In the event that the Project Participant makes a Remarketing Election with respect to any Reset Period, NCEA will promptly give notice to the Commodity Supplier to follow the provisions set forth in the Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement for each month of such Reset Period with respect to any quantities of Commodities that would otherwise have been delivered to the Project Participant. See “THE RE-PRICING AGREEMENT.” 

-24-
<!-- Page 579 -->
NCEA has further covenanted that it will not consent or agree to or permit any termination or rescission of, any assignment or novation (in whole or in part) by the Project Participant of, or any amendment to, or otherwise take any action under or in connection with, a Commodity Supply Contract that will impair the ability of NCEA to comply during the current or any future year with the collection of fees and charges pursuant to the Indenture without a Rating Confirmation. Under the Indenture, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, including delivery of a Rating Confirmation, NCEA may amend a Commodity Supply Contract or assign all or a portion of the Project Participant’s rights and obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract.

**Commodity Remarketing.** In the event that the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed to NCEA under a Commodity Supply Contract, NCEA shall promptly give notice to the Commodity Supplier to follow the provisions set forth in the Remarketing Exhibit to the Commodity Purchase Agreement for each Month of such suspension with respect to the quantities of Commodities for which deliveries have been suspended.

**Trustee as Agent.** Under the Indenture, NCEA has appointed, authorized and directed the Trustee as its agent, subject to the terms of the Indenture, to issue notices and to take any other actions that NCEA is required or permitted to take under (a) the Commodity Supply Contract, (b) the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (c) the Receivables Purchase Provisions, and (d) the NCEA Commodity Swap. NCEA has retained, in the absence of any conflicting action by the Trustee, the right to exercise any rights for which it has appointed the Trustee as its agent as described in the preceding sentence; provided, however, if an Event of Default has occurred, the Trustee will have the right to notify NCEA to cease exercising such rights, and upon NCEA’s receipt of such notice, and subject to certain rights of the Commodity Supplier and the Commodity Swap Counterparty, the Trustee will have exclusive authority to exercise such rights.

**Commodity Purchase Agreement.** NCEA has covenanted in the Indenture that it will enforce the provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and that it will duly perform its covenants and agreements under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

The Trustee will promptly notify NCEA upon becoming aware of any payment default that has occurred and is continuing on the part of the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. NCEA will provide the Trustee with Written Notice of the Early Termination Payment Date (a) by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the fifth Business Day preceding a Mandatory Purchase Date if an amount equal to the Purchase Price of the Bonds that are subject to such Mandatory Purchase Date has not been deposited with the Trustee and (b) in all other cases, not more than five days after such date is determined.

NCEA has further covenanted that it will not consent or agree to or permit any rescission or assignment of or amendment to or otherwise take any action under or in connection with the Commodity Purchase Agreement which would in any manner materially impair or materially adversely affect its rights thereunder or the rights or security of the Bondholders under the Indenture; provided, that the Commodity Purchase Agreement may be assigned or amended without Bondholder consent upon receipt of a Rating Confirmation.

**NCEA Commodity Swap.** Amounts due to NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap are payable directly to the Trustee for deposit into the Revenue Fund. The following restrictions apply to the replacement or termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap: 

-25-
<!-- Page 580 -->
(a) NCEA agrees that it will not exercise any right to declare an early termination date under the NCEA Commodity Swap unless either (i) it has entered into a replacement NCEA Commodity Swap in accordance with the provisions described below, and such replacement NCEA Commodity Swap will be effective as of such early termination date and cover price exposure from and after such early termination date, or (ii) a “Commodity Delivery Termination Date” has occurred or has been designated under (and as such term is defined in) the Commodity Purchase Agreement prior to or as of such early termination date.

(b) NCEA may replace the NCEA Commodity Swap (and any related guaranty of a Commodity Swap Counterparty’s obligations thereunder) with a similar agreement for the same hedging purposes with an alternate Commodity Swap Counterparty at any time upon delivery to the Trustee of a Rating Confirmation.

(c) If the NCEA Commodity Swap is subject to termination or is terminated by either party in accordance with its terms, then (i) NCEA may, subject to clause (a) above, terminate such NCEA Commodity Swap if NCEA has the right to do so, and (ii) (A) NCEA may replace such NCEA Commodity Swap by exercising its right to increase its notional quantities under another NCEA Commodity Swap with another Commodity Swap Counterparty if such NCEA Commodity Swap is in effect and is not subject to termination, or (B) if NCEA cannot increase its notional quantities as described in clause (A) or if NCEA desires to enter into a new NCEA Commodity Swap in order to reduce its notional quantities under the NCEA Commodity Swap to their level previous following an existing Commodity Swap with an alternate Commodity Swap Counterparty without Rating Confirmation, but only if the replacement NCEA Commodity Swap is identical in all material respects to the existing NCEA Commodity Swap, except for the identity of the Commodity Swap Counterparty, and (1) the replacement Commodity Swap Counterparty (or its credit support provider under such NCEA Commodity Swap) is then rated at least the lower of (a) the Minimum Rating or (b) the rating then assigned by each Rating Agency to the Bonds, or (2) such Commodity Swap Counterparty provides such collateral and security arrangements as NCEA shall determine to be necessary, and (3) in either case, such replacement Commodity Swap Counterparty enters into a replacement Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement with the Commodity Supplier and the Custodian that is identical in all material respects to the existing Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement for the Commodity Swap being replaced.

(d) If the NCEA Commodity Swap is not otherwise replaced but the Commodity Supplier is obligated under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement to continue paying Commodity Swap Receipts in the same amount that would have applied under such NCEA Commodity Swap, then such NCEA Commodity Swap will be deemed to be replaced by such obligation under such Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement and such obligation under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement will be treated as the NCEA Commodity Swap thereafter until such terminated NCEA Commodity Swap is otherwise replaced by another NCEA Commodity Swap.

Upon the occurrence of a Commodity Swap Replacement Event (defined below), NCEA agrees in the Indenture that it shall notify the Commodity Supplier of such event pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and in accordance with the Commodity Purchase Agreement, either (a) replace the affected NCEA Commodity Swap by exercising its right to increase its notional quantities under an NCEA Commodity Swap.

| Debt Service Reserve Account     | $       |
| Commodity Swap Reserve Account   | $       |
| Costs of Issuance³              | $       |
| **Total Uses**                  | $       |

¹ Includes available amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Fund and Working Capital Account under the 2018 Indenture.  
² Includes additional payment to the Commodity Supplier.  
³ Includes management, consulting, underwriting, rating agency, trustee, financial advisor and legal fees and other expenses related to the issuance of the Bonds and the refinancing and acquisition of the Commodity Project.

**PLAN OF REFUNDING**

Proceeds of the Bonds together with other available moneys will be deposited with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to an Escrow Agreement to establish an irrevocable trust escrow account (the “Escrow Account”), consisting of cash and noncallable direct full faith and credit obligations of the United States of America. The amounts in the Escrow Account will be used to refund the $537,295,000 principal amount of 2018 Bonds maturing on and after July 1, 2024 (the “Refunded Bonds”), and are pledged solely for the payment of the Refunded Bonds.

The investments held in the Escrow Account will bear interest and mature in amounts that are, together with the uninvested cash held in the Escrow Account, sufficient to pay the principal and redemption price of and the interest due on the Refunded Bonds on each interest payment date and on the redemption date of the Refunded Bonds. On the Initial Issue Date, NCEA will irrevocably instruct the Escrow Agent, as trustee for the Refunded Bonds, to call the Refunded Bonds maturing on July 1, 2049 for redemption on July 1, 2024. Upon the deposit of such cash and investments and satisfaction of the requirements of the 2018 Indenture, the Refunded Bonds will be deemed to be paid and will no longer be secured by the pledge of the trust estate under the 2018 Indenture.

Registrar in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Bond and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time NCEA shall deposit with the Paying Agent an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to and approved in writing by the Paying Agent for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as provided in the Indenture. The Bond Registrar will then fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which will be not more than 15 days or less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Bond Registrar of written notice of the proposed payment. The Bond Registrar shall promptly notify NCEA of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of NCEA, will cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Bondholder at its address as it appears upon the registry books, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.

INCREASED INTEREST RATE UPON LEDGER EVENT

If a Ledger Event occurs, J. Aron will be obligated to pay the Commodity Supplier, and the Commodity Supplier will be obligated to pay NCEA, scheduled Ledger Event Payments calculated to provide a sum sufficient (together with the interest component of the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits) to enable NCEA to pay interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate of 8.00% per annum. The Indenture provides that, subject to NCEA’s receipt of such Ledger Event Payments from the Commodity Supplier, interest on the Bonds will be paid at the Increased Interest Rate from and including the day on which a Ledger Event occurs but not including the earlier of (a) the date on which a Termination Payment Event occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (b) the Mandatory Purchase Date or any prior redemption date or (c) the Interest Payment Date immediately succeeding the last date on which the Commodity Supplier paid the Ledger Event Payments. Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, any Ledger Event would occur on and as of the first day of a Month.

See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Ledger Event” below for a description of the provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement relating to a Ledger Event and the amounts payable by the Commodity Supplier to NCEA following a Ledger Event. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT—Ledger Event Payments” below for a description of the provisions of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement relating to the amounts payable by J. Aron to the Commodity Supplier following a Ledger Event.

Interest on the Bonds at the Increased Interest Rate will be payable on each regular Interest Payment Date, any redemption date and the Mandatory Purchase Date. NCEA will give prompt notice to the Trustee of the occurrence of a Ledger Event and whether the Increased Interest Rate becomes payable on the Bonds. Interest on the Bonds at an Increased Interest Rate will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months and will be payable in the same manner as the interest borne by the Bonds on the Initial Issue Date.

For purposes of the Indenture:

(a) any Ledger Event Payments received by NCEA from the Commodity Supplier in respect of a Ledger Event shall not constitute an item of “Revenues” and shall be deposited directly into the Debt Service Account; and

-29-
<!-- Page 584 -->
(b) the Scheduled Debt Service Deposits required by the Indenture shall be computed on the basis of the interest rates borne by the Bonds on the Initial Issue Date and shall not be re-computed in the event that the Bonds bear interest at an Increased Interest Rate.

TENDER

Mandatory Tender. The Bonds maturing on ________, 20__ are required to be tendered for purchase on ________, 20__ (the “Mandatory Purchase Date”), which is the day following the end of the Interest Reset Period. The Purchase Price of the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date is equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof and is payable in immediately available funds first from amounts on deposit in the Remarketing Proceeds Account established by the Indenture and second from amounts on deposit in the NCEA Purchase Account established by the Indenture. Accrued interest due on the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date, which is an Interest Payment Date, shall be paid from amounts in the Debt Service Account.

The Purchase Price of each Bond on the Mandatory Purchase Date shall be payable only upon surrender of such Bond to the Trustee at its designated corporate trust office, accompanied by an instrument of transfer thereof in form satisfactory to the Trustee, executed in blank by the Owner thereof or by the Owner’s duly authorized attorney, with such signature guaranteed by a commercial bank, trust company or member firm of the New York Stock Exchange at or prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date specified for such delivery in a notice provided to the Owners by the Trustee, such notice to be given no less than 30 days prior to the Mandatory Purchase Date. In the event that any Owner of a Bond so subject to mandatory tender for purchase shall not surrender such Bond to the Trustee on the Mandatory Purchase Date, then such Bond shall be deemed to be an Undelivered Bond, and that no interest shall accrue thereon on and after such Mandatory Purchase Date and that the Owner thereof shall have no rights under the Indenture other than to receive payment of the Purchase Price thereof.

Failed Remarketing. Under the Indenture, “Failed Remarketing” means the failure (i) of the Trustee to receive the Purchase Price of any Bond required to be purchased on a Mandatory Purchase Date by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the fifth Business Day preceding such Mandatory Purchase Date or (ii) to purchase or redeem such Bond in whole by such Mandatory Purchase Date (including from any funds on deposit in the Assignment Payment Fund and required to be used for such redemption). A Failed Remarketing is a Termination Payment Event, and will result in an Early Termination Payment Date, under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and the extraordinary redemption of the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date. Such an extraordinary redemption of the Bonds has the same economic effect on Bondholders as a mandatory tender of the Bonds on the Mandatory Purchase Date.

No Optional Tender. The Bonds of are not subject to optional tender by Bondholders during the Interest Rate Reset Period.

REDEMPTION

Optional Redemption. The Bonds are subject to redemption at the option of NCEA in whole or in part (in such amounts and by such maturities as may be specified by NCEA and by lot within a maturity) on any date preceding the first Business Day of the third month preceding the Mandatory Purchase Date at a Redemption Price, calculated by a quotation agent selected by NCEA, equal to the greater of:

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Displayed)

(a) the sum of the present values of the remaining unpaid payments of principal and interest to be paid on the Bonds to be redeemed from and including the date of redemption (not including any portion of the interest accrued and unpaid as of the redemption date) to the earlier of (i) the stated maturity date(s) of such Bonds or (ii) the Mandatory Purchase Date, discounted to the date of redemption on a semiannual basis at a discount rate equal to the Applicable Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Rate (as defined in APPENDIX C) for such Bonds minus 0.25% per annum, and

(b) the Amortized Value thereof (described below);

in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption at the Fixed Rate or an Increased Interest Rate, whichever is then in effect.

The Bonds maturing on and after the Mandatory Purchase Date are also subject to redemption at the option of NCEA in whole or in part on and after the first Business Day of the third month preceding the Mandatory Purchase Date at a Redemption Price, calculated by a quotation agent selected by NCEA, equal to the Amortized Value thereof as of the date of redemption, plus $0[_] per $1,000 of the principal amount thereof and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption; provided that, if the redemption date of the Bonds is on the Mandatory Purchase Date, the Redemption Price will be 100% of the principal amount of the Bonds to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. In lieu of redeeming Bonds pursuant to this provision, NCEA may direct the Trustee to purchase such Bonds at a Purchase Price equal to the Redemption Price described above. Any Bonds so purchased may be remarketed in a new Interest Rate Period.

“Amortized Value” means, with respect to any Bond to be redeemed during the Interest Rate Reset Period, the principal amount of such Bond multiplied by the price of such Bond expressed as a percentage, calculated by a major market maker in municipal securities, as the quotation agent, selected by NCEA, based on the industry standard method of calculating bond prices (as such industry standard prevails on the date of delivery of the Bonds), with a delivery date equal to the date of redemption, a maturity date equal to the earlier of (a) the stated maturity date of such Bond, or (b) the Fixed Rate Tender Date of such Bond and a yield equal to such Bond’s original reoffering yield (as set forth on the inside cover page of this Official Statement). The Amortized Value of the Bonds as of certain dates during the Interest Rate Reset Period is shown on APPENDIX H.

Extraordinary Mandatory Redemption. The Bonds are subject to mandatory redemption prior to maturity in whole and not in part on the first day of the month following the Early Termination Payment Date (which will be the same day as the Mandatory Purchase Date in the event a Failed Remarketing has occurred) at a Redemption Price equal to the Amortized Value thereof, plus accrued interest to the redemption date.

See APPENDIX H for a schedule showing the Redemption Price (excluding accrued interest) of all of the Bonds upon an extraordinary mandatory redemption following an Early Termination Payment Date that occurs during the Interest Rate Reset Period.

NCEA shall provide the Trustee with Written Notice of the Early Termination Payment Date (x) by noon New York City time on the fifth Business Day preceding a Mandatory Purchase Date if an amount equal to the Purchase Price of the Bonds that are subject to such Mandatory Purchase Date has not been deposited with the Trustee, and (y) in all other cases, not more than five days after such date is determined.

With respect to any notice of optional redemption of Bonds, unless upon the giving of such notice such Bonds will be deemed to have been paid under the Indenture, such notice must state that such redemption will be conditioned upon the receipt by the Trustee on or prior to the date fixed for such redemption of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of and interest on the Bonds to be redeemed, and that if such money shall not have been so received said notice will be of no force and effect, and NCEA will not be required to redeem such Bonds. In the event that such notice of redemption contains such a condition and such money is not so received, the redemption will not be made and the Trustee must within a reasonable time thereafter give notice, in the manner in which the notice of redemption was given, that such money was not received and that such redemption was not made.

**Effect of Redemption.** On any redemption date, the Redemption Price of each Bond to be redeemed, together with the accrued interest thereon to such date, will become due and payable, and from and after such date, notice having been given and moneys available solely for such redemption being on deposit with the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture governing redemption of such Bonds, then, notwithstanding that any Bonds called for redemption may not have been surrendered, no further interest will accrue on any of such Bonds. From and after such date of redemption (such notice having been given and moneys available solely for such redemption being on deposit with the Trustee), the Bonds to be redeemed will not be deemed to be Outstanding under the Indenture.

**Partial Redemption of Bonds.** If less than all of the Bonds of like maturity and Series are called for redemption, such Bonds or portions of Bonds must be redeemed in increments of Authorized Denominations, and such increments to be called for redemption must be selected by lot in such manner as the Trustee determines (subject to the rules and procedures of DTC, as the Securities Depository). Upon surrender of any Bond called for redemption in part only, NCEA must execute, and the Trustee must authenticate and deliver to the Holder thereof, a new Bond or Bonds of Authorized Denominations and the same series and maturity in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Bond surrendered.

**BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM**

The Bonds will be initially issued in book-entry only form through the facilities of DTC. The Bonds will be transferable and exchangeable as set forth in the Indenture and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. DTC will act as securities depository for the Bonds. So long as Cede & Co. is the registered owner of the Bonds, principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds are payable by wire transfer by the Trustee to Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC, which, in turn, will remit such amounts to DTC participants for subsequent disbursement to the Beneficial Owners. See APPENDIX G—“BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.”

**THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement relating to (i) the purchase and sale of natural gas during the Gas Delivery Period and (ii) the purchase and sale of electricity during the Electricity Delivery Period, if any. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and accordingly is qualified by reference to the full text thereof.

**PURCHASE AND SALE**

Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver specified daily quantities of natural gas each month during the Gas Delivery Period at a fixed price, and NCEA has agreed to make a lump sum advance payment to the Commodity Supplier for all of the cost of the gas to be delivered during the Gas Delivery Period (as well as the electricity to be delivered during the Electricity Delivery Period). The total quantity of gas to be delivered by the Commodity Supplier during the Gas Delivery Period is expected to be approximately [__] million MMBtu.

On the Switch Date, deliveries of gas under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will cease, and deliveries of electricity will commence. NCEA may elect to have the Switch Date occur any time on or after June 1, 2028.

-34-
<!-- Page 589 -->
# DELIVERY OF GAS

During the Gas Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier is required to deliver fixed, pre-determined quantities of gas at the primary delivery point specified in the Commodity Purchase Agreement or to an alternate delivery point mutually agreed to by the Commodity Supplier, NCEA and the Project Participant. The Contract Quantity of gas required to be delivered on each day during the term of the Gas Delivery Period matches the Contract Quantity of gas that NCEA has agreed to deliver to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract. The approximate aggregate monthly quantities of gas to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement during the Gas Delivery Period range from a high of approximately 1.1 million MMBtu of gas in some months to no gas in other months.

# DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY

During each hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Supplier is required to deliver fixed Hourly Quantities of electricity at the primary delivery point or one of the secondary delivery points specified in the Commodity Purchase Agreement or to an alternate delivery point mutually agreed to by the Commodity Supplier, NCEA and the Project Participant. The Hourly Quantity of electricity required to be delivered on each day during the term of the Electricity Delivery Period matches the Hourly Quantity of electricity that NCEA has agreed to deliver to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract.

As of the beginning of the Electricity Delivery Period, the Project Participant may assign one or more Assigned PPAs to J. Aron pursuant to PPA Assignment Agreements. During each month that an Assigned PPA is in effect, the Commodity Supplier agrees to deliver and NCEA agrees to take the Assigned Prepay Quantity of Assigned Electricity. Delivery, scheduling and transmission of Assigned Electricity, and title to and risk of loss of Assigned Electricity will be as provided in the applicable Assigned PPA and the applicable Assignment Agreement.

The Assigned Prepay Quantity is generally the “P99” output of the generating project that supplies an Assigned PPA or such lesser amount as may be determined pursuant to the provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract. If the quantity of Assigned Electricity that is delivered under an Assigned PPA exceeds the Assigned Prepay Quantity in any month (such excess being referred to as the “Assigned PAYGO Amount”), NCEA will pay the Commodity Supplier an amount equal to the quantity of the Assigned PAYGO Amount multiplied by the contract price under the Assigned PPA. If the quantity of Assigned Electricity that is delivered under an Assigned PPA is less than the Assigned Prepay Quantity in any month for any reason other than force majeure, NCEA will be deemed to have requested the Commodity Supplier to remarket the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered. The Commodity Supplier will sell such portion in a private business use sale will pay NCEA the product of (a) the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered and (b) the Contract Specified Price minus the applicable Remarketing Fee. All such sales made by the Commodity Supplier will be entered on the private business sales ledger that is maintained pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “Commodity Remarketing” below.

# PPA Payment Custodial Agreement

The Project Participant, J. Aron, the Commodity Supplier, NCEA and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as custodian (in such capacity, the “Custodian”) have entered into a custodial agreement (the “PPA Payment Custodial Agreement”) to administer payments to be received by the sellers of Assigned Electricity pursuant to the Assigned PPAs (the “PPA Sellers”). The PPA Payment Custodial Agreement is not pledged as part of the Trust Estate.

![FAILURE TO DELIVER OR RECEIVE COMMODITIES](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=FAILURE+TO+DELIVER+OR+RECEIVE+COMMODITIES)

Because NCEA will have prepaid for all of the natural gas and electricity to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supplier will be required to pay NCEA for all Commodities that the Commodity Supplier fails to deliver or NCEA fails to receive for any reason, including events of force majeure. The amount the Commodity Supplier is required to pay is equal to the quantity that was not delivered or received multiplied by a price that is determined in a manner depending upon the reason for such failure:

- If the Commodity Supplier breaches its obligation to deliver gas or electricity (i.e., for reasons other than force majeure or action or inaction by NCEA), NCEA shall exercise Commercially Reasonable Efforts to purchase Replacement Gas during the Gas Delivery Period or Replacement Electricity during the Electricity Delivery Period, and the Commodity Supplier is required to pay the higher of (a) the replacement costs incurred by NCEA or the Project Participant to purchase replacement gas or electricity, including in some instances replacement gas purchased after the fact to replace any stored gas that was used to cover the delivery shortfall, or (b) the Monthly Index Price during the Gas Delivery Period or the Day-Ahead Market Price during the Electricity Delivery Period, plus in either case a specified administrative fee of per unit of undelivered gas or electricity. If no replacement gas is actually purchased to cover the delivery shortfall, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay NCEA the Monthly Index Price during the Gas Delivery Period or the Day-Ahead Market Price during the Electricity Delivery Period.

- If NCEA breaches its obligation to take Commodities (i.e., for reasons other than force majeure or action or inaction by the Commodity Supplier), the Commodity Supplier is required to pay (a) during the Gas Delivery Period, the lesser of the Monthly Index Price or a daily low market index price, less specified remarketing fees and (b) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the price at which the Commodity Supplier, acting in a Commercially Reasonable manner, resells at the applicable delivery point any electricity not received by NCEA, deducting from such proceeds any (i) costs reasonably incurred by Seller in reselling such electricity and (ii) additional transmission charges, if any, reasonably incurred by the Commodity Supplier in delivering such electricity to the third party purchasers, or at the Commodity Supplier’s option, the market price at the applicable delivery point for such electricity not received as determined by the Commodity Supplier in a Commercially Reasonable manner.

- If either the Commodity Supplier fails to deliver Commodities or NCEA fails to receive Commodities due to events of force majeure, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay (a) during the Gas Delivery Period, the applicable Index Price and (b) during the Electricity Delivery Period, the applicable Day-Ahead Market Price.

**COMMODITY REMARKETING**

If the Project Participant is in default under the Commodity Supply Contract or does not require or is unable to receive all or any portion of the Commodities purchased by NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement as a result of (a) Project Participant’s decreased gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period or (b) decreased demand by Project Participant’s retail customers, NCEA agrees to require the Commodity Supplier to remarket to other purchasers all or a specified portion of the Commodities. 

-36-
<!-- Page 591 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Commodities to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement by delivering Monthly Remarketing Notices or Daily Remarketing Notices as provided in the Commodity Purchase Agreement. J. Aron has agreed to provide all services necessary for the Commodity Supplier to meet its commodity remarketing obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT — J. Aron as Agent.”

There are three types of potential remarketing sales when proper notice has been tendered: qualified sales to Municipal Utilities, non-private business use sales and private business use sales. The Commodity Supplier is required to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remarket Commodities first in qualified sales and next in non-private business use sales. If the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket the Commodities designated in a remarketing notice in qualified sales or in non-private business use sales, it will purchase the Commodities. Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Supplier delegates, and J. Aron assumes, all of the Commodity Supplier’s Commodity remarketing obligations under the remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT— J. Aron as Agent—Commodity Remarketing.”

The amounts payable by the Commodity Supplier for Commodities remarketed are the actual sale proceeds or the amounts based on the Index Price, depending on the timing of the notice given by NCEA and the type of remarketing, less specified remarketing fees.

The Commodity Supplier must track in dollar and Commodity unit ledgers information relating to the remarketing proceeds and the quantities of Commodities remarketed, including sales made to the Project Participant and other Municipal Utilities, to non-private business users and to private business users. NCEA will seek to make additional qualified sales, and the Commodity Supplier will seek to locate opportunities for NCEA to purchase Commodities to sell in additional qualified sales, in each case to reduce the ledger amounts associated with non-private and private business use sales.

Assigned Electricity. If the quantity of Assigned Electricity that is delivered under an Assigned PPA is less than the Assigned Prepay Quantity in any month for any reason other than force majeure, NCEA will be deemed to have requested the Commodity Supplier to remarket the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered. The Commodity Supplier will sell such portion in a private business use sale and will pay NCEA the product of (a) the portion of the Contract Quantity not delivered and (b) the Contract Specified Price minus the applicable Remarketing Fee. All such sales made by the Commodity Supplier will be entered on the private business sales ledger that is maintained pursuant to the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

LEDGER EVENT

The Commodity Supplier is required to use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to remarket gas first in Qualified Sales and next in Non-Private Business Sales. If the Commodity Supplier is unable to remarket the Commodity designated in a remarketing notice in Qualified Sales or in Non-Private Business Sales, it will purchase the Commodity. To the extent the Commodity Supplier purchases such Commodity or remarkets such Commodity other than in Qualified Sales to Municipal Utilities, NCEA will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to use the proceeds of such remarketing to purchase Commodities for resale in Qualified Sales. The Commodity Supplier may also propose that NCEA use such proceeds to purchase Commodities for sale to Municipal Utilities identified by the Commodity Supplier.
<!-- Page 592 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

The Commodity Supplier will maintain a ledger set that accounts for private business use remarketing sales of Commodities and non-qualified remarketing sales of Commodities. If there is a remaining balance on the ledger set two years after any remarketing of Commodities in a private business use sale or a non-qualified sale, such balance will count against:

(a) in the case of private business use sales, (i) during the Gas Delivery Period, a limit equal to a quantity of gas that is equal to $15 million divided by the fixed price per MMBtu under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and (ii) during the Electricity Delivery Period, a quantity of electricity equal to $15 million divided by the fixed price per MWh under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and

(b) in the case of non-qualified sales, (i) during the Gas Delivery Period, a limit on the quantity of gas (in MMBtu) equal to 10% of the total quantity of gas to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and (ii) during the Electricity Delivery Period, a limit on the quantity of electricity (in MWh) equal to 10% of the total quantity of electricity to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement,

in each case, subject to any higher amount as may be set forth in an Opinion of Bond Counsel. Each of the above limits apply in the aggregate over the term of the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event that any limit is exceeded, a “Ledger Event” will occur under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

# PAYMENT PROVISIONS

[The additional prepayment from NCEA to the Commodity Supplier will be due prior to the inception of the term of the Commodity Purchase Agreement.] To the extent amounts become payable by the Commodity Supplier (for example, as a result of a remarketing or a failure to deliver by the Commodity Supplier), such amounts are due on the 22nd day of the month following the month in which such amount accrues (or, if later, the tenth day following receipt of an invoice). Amounts payable by NCEA are due on the 25th day of the month following the month in which such amounts accrue (or, if later, the tenth day following receipt of an invoice).

# FORCE MAJEURE

Each of NCEA and the Commodity Supplier are excused from their respective obligations to receive and deliver Commodities under the Commodity Purchase Agreement to the extent prevented by force majeure, defined generally as an event or circumstance which prevents one party from performing its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, which event or circumstance was not anticipated as of the date of the execution of the Commodity Purchase Agreement, which is not within the reasonable control of, or the result of the negligence of, the claiming party, and which, by the exercise of due diligence, the claiming party is unable to overcome or avoid or cause to be avoided. This excuse to performance includes such events as natural disasters, unusually extreme or severe weather related events, interruption or curtailment of gas transportation or storage, governmental actions, and strikes.

# ASSIGNMENT

Neither party may assign its rights under the Commodity Purchase Agreement without the other party’s consent except:

(a) pursuant to the Indenture, NCEA may transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign the Commodity Purchase Agreement to the Trustee in connection with a financing arrangement; provided that NCEA may not assign its rights under the Commodity Purchase Agreement unless, contemporaneously with the effectiveness of such assignment, NCEA also assigns the NCEA Commodity Swap and the NCEA Custodial Agreement to the same assignee; and

(b) the Commodity Supplier may assign the Commodity Purchase Agreement to an affiliate of the Commodity Supplier, which assignment shall constitute a novation; provided that the assignee agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and (i) the Commodity Supplier delivers a Rating Confirmation to NCEA with respect to such assignment, (ii) contemporaneously with the effectiveness of such assignment, the Commodity Supplier also assigns the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement and the SPE Master Custodial Agreement to the same assignee and either (A) the Commodity Supplier assigns the Funding Agreement and the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to the same assignee or (B) the assignee provides to NCEA a guarantee by GSG of the assignee’s obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, and (iii) the assignee is a special purpose entity approved by NCEA or its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement are guaranteed by a Funding Recipient to the satisfaction of NCEA.

<!-- Page 594 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  

If either (a) the Commodity Supplier notifies NCEA that the Funding Agreement will not be replaced, re-financed or re-priced as of the end of any Interest Rate Period for the Bonds, (b) the Commodity Supplier is unable to provide, under the Re-Pricing Agreement, an estimated Available Discount for any Reset Period that is equal to or greater than the applicable minimum discount under the Commodity Supply Contract or (c) NCEA can provide reasonable evidence that the Commodity Supplier’s estimated Reset Period Implied Rate (as defined in the Re-Pricing Agreement) is materially less than the rate the Commodity Supplier would offer to a substantially similar counterparty in an arm’s length transaction on the same date, then, at the request of NCEA, the Commodity Supplier will reasonably cooperate with NCEA to cause the Commodity Supplier’s (or the Commodity Supplier’s affiliate’s) right, title and interest in the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Re-Pricing Agreement, the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap and all agreements related to any of the foregoing to be novated to a replacement seller. The Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Indenture impose certain requirements for any such novation, including the delivery of a Rating Confirmation.

**FUNDING AGREEMENT**

Except (a) to cure any ambiguity, supply any omission, or cure or correct any defect or inconsistent provision in the Funding Agreement, (b) to insert such provisions clarifying matters or questions arising under the Funding Agreement as are necessary or desirable and are not contrary to or inconsistent therewith or (c) to convert or supplement any provision in a manner consistent with the intent of the Funding Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the Commodity Supplier agrees in the Commodity Purchase Agreement that it shall not agree to any amendment, alteration, assignment or modification to the Funding Agreement or any guaranty of the Funding Recipient’s obligations thereunder without receipt of a Rating Confirmation and the prior written consent of NCEA; provided that the consent of NCEA shall not be required in connection with (i) the replacement, refinancing or re-pricing of the Funding Agreement at the end of any Interest Rate Period in accordance with the terms of the Funding Agreement or (ii) the Commodity Supplier’s assignment of its interest in the Funding Agreement or consent to Funding Recipient’s assignment of its interest in the Funding Agreement to the extent the Commodity Supplier provides a Rating Confirmation to NCEA with respect to any such assignment.

**EARLY TERMINATION**

A Commodity Delivery Termination Date will occur automatically under the Commodity Purchase Agreement upon the occurrence of a Termination Payment Event (which includes a Failed Remarketing with respect to the Bonds) or an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event (as such terms are described below). Upon the occurrence of an Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event (as described below), a Commodity Delivery Termination Date may be designated by the Commodity Supplier, as described below. If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs, the Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement will end and, if the Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs as a result of a Termination Payment Event, the Commodity Supplier will be required to make the payment or payments described under “Remedies and Termination” below.

-40-
<!-- Page 595 -->
![Termination Payment Event](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Termination+Payment+Event)

**Termination Payment Event.** A Termination Payment Event will occur under the Commodity Purchase Agreement if:

- [• the exercise by the Funding Recipient of the Funding Recipient Acceleration Option;]
- [• the exercise by the Commodity Supplier of the Commodity Supplier Acceleration Option;]

• the Commodity Supplier fails to pay when due any amounts owed to NCEA under the Commodity Purchase Agreement because of a failure by the Funding Recipient to pay when due any amounts owed to the Commodity Supplier pursuant to the Funding Agreement and such failure continues for 30 days after NCEA gives notice thereof to the Commodity Supplier;

• as of three Business Days prior to the last day of exchange trading for Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange (or successor thereto) for deliveries in the first month following a Reset Period, either (a) NCEA has not entered into a bond purchase agreement, firm remarketing agreement or similar agreement with respect to the remarketing or refunding of the Bonds or (b) the Commodity Supplier is unable to replace, refinance or re-price the Funding Agreement for a subsequent Reset Period;

• a Failed Remarketing occurs; or

• both (a) the Project Participant makes a Remarketing Election for a Reset Period, and (b) J. Aron exercises its option to designate a CSSA Early Termination Date under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement.

**Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Events.** The Commodity Supplier will have the right to designate a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement under the following circumstances:

• a Ledger Event occurs; or

• except in the case where an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event has occurred, both (a) an early termination date under the NCEA Commodity Swap is designated by the Commodity Swap Counterparty or occurs automatically based on a termination event where NCEA is the sole affected party and (b) either the NCEA Commodity Swap or the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap is not replaced within the Swap Replacement Period.

**Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Events.** A Commodity Delivery Termination Date will occur automatically, that will not result on its own as a Termination Payment Event, under the Commodity Purchase Agreement under the following circumstances:

• following receipt of an offer by the Trustee to sell Swap Call Receivables under the Receivables Purchase Provisions, the Commodity Supplier does not exercise (or is deemed not to have exercised) its related option to purchase Swap Call Receivables within the timeline set forth in the Receivables Purchase Provisions;

-41-
<!-- Page 596 -->
• both (a) a CSSA Early Termination Date occurs under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, and (b) the Commodity Supplier is unable to enter into a replacement Commodity Sale and Service Agreement in compliance with the requirements of the Commodity Purchase Agreement by the date that is 120 days following such early termination date;

• an early termination date under the NCEA Commodity Swap is designated by the Commodity Swap Counterparty based on an event of default due to NCEA’s insolvency or bankruptcy; or

• both (a) an early termination date under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap is designated by the Commodity Swap Counterparty based on an event of default where the Commodity Supplier is the defaulting party or a termination event where the Commodity Supplier is the sole affected party, or otherwise occurs automatically and (b) except for certain events of default and termination events for which the Swap Replacement Period does not apply, either the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap or the NCEA Commodity Swap is not replaced within the Swap Replacement Period.

REPLACEMENT OF COMMODITY SWAPS

NCEA and the Commodity Supplier agree in the Commodity Purchase Agreement that if any Commodity Swap terminates, is being terminated or is expected to be terminated, in each case for any reason other than the insolvency of NCEA or the Commodity Supplier or the failure of the Commodity Supplier to make payments or post collateral under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, then:

(a) (i) if an NCEA Commodity Swap and a Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap with another Commodity Swap Counterparty are in effect and are not subject to termination, NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will exercise any rights they may have to increase their notional quantities thereunder in order to replace the Commodity Swap affected by the events described above and the other Commodity Swap and (ii) subsequent to such a replacement, NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will cooperate in good faith to locate replacement agreements with a second Commodity Swap Counterparty and, upon locating such second Commodity Swap Counterparty, NCEA and the Commodity Supplier will reduce their notional quantities under the remaining Commodity Swaps to their original levels and enter into replacement Commodity Swaps with the replacement Commodity Swap Counterparty for the remaining notional quantities; and

(b) if NCEA and the Commodity Supplier cannot increase the notional quantities of the Commodity Swaps as described in (a) above, they will cooperate in good faith to locate replacement agreements with an alternate Swap Counterparty to replace both of the Commodity Swaps within the Swap Replacement Period.

The “Swap Replacement Period” is the period that begins on the earlier of the date of (x) any termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap or the Commodity Supplier Swap designated by the Commodity Swap Counterparty and (y) delivery of a notice of anticipated termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap or the Commodity Supplier Swap by a Swap Counterparty, and ends 60 days later.

# REMEDIES AND TERMINATION PAYMENT

## Commodity Delivery Termination Date
A Commodity Delivery Termination Date will occur automatically upon the occurrence of a Termination Payment Event or an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event. If an Optional Commodity Delivery Termination Event has occurred and is continuing, then the Commodity Supplier, as described above, may designate a Commodity Delivery Termination Date.

## End of Delivery Period
As of the Commodity Delivery Termination Date:

(a) the Delivery Period will end;

(b) the obligation of NCEA to receive deliveries of Commodities will terminate; and

(c) the obligation of the Commodity Supplier to make any further deliveries of Commodities will terminate and, unless such Commodity Delivery Termination Date resulted from a Termination Payment Event, will be replaced with a continuing obligation of the Commodity Supplier to pay scheduled monthly amounts to NCEA until the earlier of (i) the Month in which a Termination Payment Event occurs and (ii) the last due date for such scheduled payments; and

The Commodity Purchase Agreement will continue in effect after the Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs. The occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date will not prevent the contemporaneous or subsequent occurrence of a Termination Payment Event.

## Termination Payment; Early Termination Payment Date
Following a Termination Payment Event, the Commodity Supplier is required to pay the Termination Payment to the Trustee on the Early Termination Payment Date. The “Early Termination Payment Date” is the last Business Day of the first Month that commences after a Termination Payment Event occurs. In the case of a Termination Payment Event that results from a Failed Remarketing, the Early Termination Payment Date will be the last Business Day of the current Interest Rate Period. The obligation of the Commodity Supplier to pay the Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date is unconditional, and the Commodity Supplier waives all rights to set-off, counterclaim, recoupment and any other defenses that might otherwise be available with regard to its obligation to pay the Termination Payment on the Early Termination Payment Date.

The amount of the Termination Payment is set forth on a schedule to the Commodity Purchase Agreement. The Termination Payment payable by the Commodity Supplier, together with the amounts required to be on deposit in certain Funds and Accounts held by the Trustee, has been calculated to provide a sum at least sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of the Bonds, assuming that the Funding Recipient, the Project Participant, the Commodity Supplier and the Investment Agreement Provider pay and perform their respective contract obligations when due. If the Debt Service Reserve Account is depleted due to payment defaults by the Project Participant and is not timely replenished, the Termination Payment and the other available funds held under the Indenture will likely not be adequate to redeem the Bonds in full. See APPENDIX I for a schedule of the Termination Payment as of specified Early Termination Payment Dates under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

<!-- Page 598 -->
# RECEIVABLES PURCHASE PROVISIONS

Under certain circumstances, the Commodity Supplier has agreed to purchase from NCEA the rights to payment of net amounts owed by the Project Participant (“Swap Call Receivables”) under the Commodity Supply Contract.

## Swap Call Receivables
If the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under the Commodity Supply Contract, and such nonpayment results in a Swap Payment Deficiency, then on the next succeeding Business Day, NCEA shall deliver a written offer (a “Swap Call Receivables Offer”) to sell to the Commodity Supplier sufficient Swap Call Receivables (such amount, less any undisputed amounts owed by NCEA to the Project Participant under the Commodity Supply Contract, the “Swap Call Receivables Amount”) to fund such Swap Payment Deficiency. No later than one Business Day following the Commodity Supplier’s receipt of a Swap Call Receivables Offer, the Commodity Supplier may elect, in its discretion, to purchase the Swap Call Receivables referenced in the Swap Call Receivables Offer by delivering a written notice (“Call Option Notice”) to NCEA of the Commodity Supplier’s intent to purchase such Swap Call Receivables. If the Commodity Supplier does not deliver a Call Option Notice to NCEA on or before the Business Day following the Commodity Supplier’s receipt of a Swap Call Receivables Offer, the Commodity Supplier will be deemed to have elected not to purchase the referenced Swap Call Receivables, which constitutes an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

## Elective Call Receivables
If the Project Participant defaults on its obligation to make any payment under its Commodity Supply Contract with PEAK and such payment default does not result in a Swap Payment Deficiency, the Trustee shall deliver a written offer (an “Elective Call Receivables Offer”) to sell to the Commodity Supplier the receivables relating to such payment default (“Elective Call Receivables”) and, together with Swap Call Receivables, “Call Receivables”). Any time after the Commodity Supplier’s receipt of an Elective Call Receivables Offer, the Commodity Supplier may elect, in its discretion, to purchase the Elective Call Receivables referenced in the Elective Call Receivables Offer by delivering a written notice to the Trustee of the Commodity Supplier’s intent to purchase such Elective Call Receivables. The election by the Commodity Supplier not to purchase Swap Call Receivables is not an Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

## Conditions to Purchase and Sale of Call Receivables
NCEA’s obligation to offer to sell such Call Receivables is subject to the condition that all of the representations and warranties made by the Commodity Supplier at the time of execution and delivery of the Receivables Purchase Provisions be true and correct on each day that the Trustee is required to offer to sell Call Receivables.

## Call Receivables Purchase by J. Aron
Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, J. Aron has agreed to purchase any Call Receivable purchased by the Commodity Supplier under the Receivables Purchase Provisions; provided that J. Aron’s obligation to purchase Call Receivables is subject to it having provided its prior written consent to the purchase of such Call Receivables by the Commodity Supplier. See “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT.”

# THE RE-PRICING AGREEMENT

Set forth below is a summary of certain provisions of the Re-Pricing Agreement. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the terms and conditions of the Re-Pricing Agreement and accordingly is qualified by reference to the full text thereof.

## GENERAL

The Re-Pricing Agreement provides for (a) the determination of delivery periods (“Reset Periods”) subsequent to the Reset Period that corresponds to the Interest Rate Reset Period on the Bonds and the calculation of the amount of the discount (in cents per Commodity Unit) that is available (the “Available Discount”) for sales of Commodities to the Project Participant during each Reset Period.

“Commodity Unit” means [one MMBtu of gas or one MWh of electricity, as applicable]. [NTD: “Commodity Unit” needs to be defined.]

The Reset Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement that corresponds to the Interest Rate Reset Period begins on the first day of ________ 20__ and ends on the last day of ________ 20__ and the next Reset Period is expected to begin on the first day of ________ 20__.

## REMARKETING ELECTION

In the event that the Available Discount for any Reset Period is less than the minimum discount specified in the Commodity Supply Contract (which includes both monthly discounts and any annual refunds), the Project Participant may elect not to take Commodities during the Reset Period and to have such Commodities remarketed for the duration of the Reset Period (a “Remarketing Election”) by giving notice of such election to NCEA, the Commodity Supplier and NCEA. Any Commodities that are covered by a Remarketing Election will be remarketed in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Commodity Purchase Agreement. In the event that the Project Participant makes a Remarketing Election with respect to a Reset Period, J. Aron will have the option to terminate the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. If J. Aron exercises this option, a Termination Payment Event and an Early Payment Termination Date will occur under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. See “THE RE-PRICING AGREEMENT” and “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT — Remarketing” and “— Early Termination.” [NTD: Above description does not match the CSSA which retains the “50% of Contract Quantities” phrasing for the termination option.]

## REPLACEMENT OF FUNDING AGREEMENT

The Re-Pricing Agreement includes provisions that enable the Commodity Supplier to obtain proposals from the Funding Recipient and other qualified funding providers for funding agreements to replace the Funding Agreement upon the maturity date of the Funding Agreement (which coincides with the end of the Interest Rate Reset Period). NCEA agrees to cooperate in good faith with the Commodity Supplier and to take all steps reasonably within its control to cause the Bonds to be remarketed or refunded for the Interest Rate Period that corresponds to each Reset Period.

Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, J. Aron has agreed to sell and deliver the Contract Quantity of Commodities each gas day during the Gas Delivery Period and each delivery hour during the Electricity Delivery Period, as applicable, in exchange for payment from the Commodity Supplier of an amount equal to the applicable Index Price for the delivery point set forth in the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, plus any price differential for the delivery point, plus a specified fee per Commodity Unit (the “J. Aron Commodity Fee”), regardless of whether or not such Commodities are delivered pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. The daily quantities of gas, hourly quantities of electricity, delivery point provisions and delivery period under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement match the corresponding provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and, in turn, the corresponding provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract. In addition to the J. Aron Commodity Fee, the Commodity Supplier agrees to pay a structuring fee on the effective date of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement in consideration of its services in connection with the arrangement, establishment, hedging and funding of the Commodity Project.

**J. ARON AS AGENT**

**General.** Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Supplier appoints and directs J. Aron as its agent and J. Aron agrees to issue notices and other communications, billing statements and to take any other actions that the Commodity Supplier is required or permitted to take under (a) the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (b) the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, (c) the Re-Pricing Agreement, and (d) the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (collectively, the “Commodity Documents”); provided that J. Aron’s agency role with respect to the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement shall be limited to ordinary course actions required in connection with the Commodity Project and J. Aron shall have no right to waive, modify or amend the terms of the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement on the Commodity Supplier’s behalf or to act on the Commodity Supplier’s behalf with respect to any dispute thereunder. In exercising this agency power, J. Aron shall have the authority to take any such actions as it deems necessary under the Commodity Documents.

**Standard of Care.** In the conduct and performance of its agency role, J. Aron shall conduct itself consistent with and observe the same standard of care as it has in similar transactions in which J. Aron has acted as the seller under prepaid natural gas and commodities agreements, and the Commodity Supplier acknowledges and agrees that J. Aron shall have no obligation to observe a standard of care greater than it has in such similar transactions or to take any actions or measures beyond those it typically takes in connection with such transactions. J. Aron shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted by it in acting as agent on behalf of the Commodity Supplier, except as expressly set forth in the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement.

**Commodities Remarketing.** Under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Supplier delegates, and J.

**Call Receivables Purchase.** J. Aron agrees in the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to purchase any Call Receivable purchased by the Commodity Supplier under the Receivables Purchase Provisions. J. Aron accordingly has the right in its sole discretion to direct the Commodity Supplier on the exercise of its right to purchase Call Receivables. J. Aron agrees to accept the transfer of Call Receivables as a credit against amounts owed by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement and, to the extent that the amount of such Call Receivables exceeds the amount so owed by the Commodity Supplier in any Month, J.

Aron agrees to pay the purchase price for Call Receivables not later than the applicable purchase date specified in the Receivables Purchase Provisions by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

**FAILURE TO DELIVER OR RECEIVE COMMODITIES**  
J. Aron will be required to pay the Commodity Supplier for all Commodities that J. Aron fails to deliver or the Commodity Supplier fails to receive for any reason, including events of force majeure. The amount J. Aron is required to pay the Commodity Supplier is equal to the amount the Commodity Supplier is required to pay NCEA for Commodities not delivered or received under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

**PAYMENT PROVISIONS**  
Amounts due from J. Aron to the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (for example, as a result of remarketing or failure to deliver by J. Aron) will be due on or before the 22nd day of the month following the month in which such amount accrues (or, if later, the tenth day following receipt of an invoice); provided that the purchase price of any Call Receivables purchased by J. Aron shall be paid on the applicable purchase date under the Receivables Purchase Provisions. Amounts due from the Commodity Supplier to J. Aron will be due on or before the 26th day of the month following the month in which such amount accrued (or, if later, the 10th day following receipt of an invoice). J.

# ASSIGNMENT

Neither party may assign its rights or obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement without the other party’s consent, except that J. Aron may assign the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to an affiliate of J. Aron, which assignment will constitute a novation; provided that (a) the CSSA Guaranty continues to apply to the obligations of such assignee under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement or (b) the assignee delivers to the Commodity Supplier a Rating Confirmation with respect to such assignment.

![Optional Non-Default Termination Event](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Optional+Non-Default+Termination+Event)

**Optional Non-Default Termination Event.** Each of the following events constitutes an “Optional Non–Default Termination Event” under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement:

(a) the Commodity Supplier has the option to terminate the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement during the Gas Delivery Period if a “Persistent Delivery Failure” occurs as a result of;

(i) J. Aron failing to deliver any gas for 12 consecutive gas days at all delivery points;

(ii) J. Aron delivering less than 50% of all gas required to be delivered at all delivery points on any 45 consecutive gas days; or

(iii) J. Aron delivering less than 85% of all gas required to be delivered at all delivery points on any 180 gas days (consecutive or non-consecutive) during any period of 365 consecutive days; or

(b) J. Aron has the option to terminate the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement if the Commodity Supplier provides that the Project Participant has made a Remarketing Election for any Reset Period (a “GSC Remarketing Event”). [NTD: See note on p. 48.]

**Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event.** The occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement constitutes an “Automatic Commodity Delivery Termination Event” under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement.

**REMEDIES AND TERMINATION**

Upon the occurrence of a J. Aron Default or a Commodity Supplier Default, the non-defaulting party may designate an early termination date under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (a “CSSA Early Termination Date”). Upon the occurrence of an Optional Non–Default Termination Event due to a Persistent Delivery Failure, the Commodity Supplier may designate a CSSA Early Termination Date. Upon the occurrence of an Optional Non–Default Termination Event due to a GSC Remarketing Event, J. Aron may designate a CSSA Early Termination Date. A CSSA Early Termination Date will occur automatically upon the occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

If a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs, the Delivery Period for gas under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement will end and the obligations of the parties to deliver and receive gas will terminate.

**SECURITY**

GSG has provided to the Commodity Supplier a guaranty of J. Aron’s payment obligations under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement (the “CSSA Guaranty”). None of NCEA, the Trustee or the Bondholders have rights to enforce the CSSA Guaranty.

THE COMMODITY SUPPLIER

Organization. The Commodity Supplier is a Delaware limited liability company organized for the sole purpose of entering into the transactions on its part with respect to the Commodity Project described herein. J. Aron is the sole member of the Commodity Supplier (the “Member”), and has funded the Commodity Supplier with the cash equity contribution and the subordinated loans described below.

The Commodity Supplier is governed by a three-member board of directors. One director is appointed by J. Aron, one director is appointed by NCEA, and the third director is an independent director appointed by J. Aron. The directors have appointed J. Aron as the manager of the Commodity Supplier.

The director appointed by NCEA has the sole consent rights with respect to certain matters, including: (i) the designation of a CSSA Early Termination Date under the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement; the designation of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement due to the occurrence of a Ledger Event; the enforcement of the Funding Agreement; under certain circumstances, the removal and replacement of J.

NCEA covenants in the Indenture that, in any vote that comes before the board of directors of the Commodity Supplier regarding the Commodity Supplier Documents, it will instruct the NCEA-appointed director to exercise its voting rights in favor of (a) the Commodity Supplier (i) observing and performing its obligations under the Commodity Purchase Agreement and (ii) observing and performing its obligations and enforcing the provisions of the other Commodity Supplier Documents against the counterparties thereto, and (b) not permitting any assignment, rescission, amendment or waiver to or of the Commodity Supplier Documents which will in any manner materially impair or materially adversely affect the rights of NCEA thereunder or the rights or security of the Bondholders under the Indenture.

The director appointed by J. Aron has sole consent rights with respect to other matters, including: (a) the designation of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement due to a
<!-- Page 606 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

The independent director is required to consider only the interests of the Commodity Supplier and its creditors in acting or voting on certain material actions that require the unanimous consent of the directors. No resignation or removal of the independent director will be effective until a successor independent director has accepted his or her appointment.

**Subordinated Loan Agreements; Capitalization.** Pursuant to two Subordinated Term Loan Agreements (the “Subordinated Loan Agreements”), J. Aron has agreed (a) to make an initial term loan to the Commodity Supplier in the amount of $ ______ million not later than the closing date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (the “Initial Term Loan”), and (b) if, following an Event of Default (as defined in the Funding Agreement) with respect to the Funding Recipient, the Commodity Supplier exercises its right to demand payment of the entire amount held in the Funding Account (or the Funding Agreement terminates automatically due the dissolution, liquidation or similar proceeding with respect to the Funding Recipient), an additional loan of up to $ ______ million on any Early Termination Payment Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (the “Contingent Term Loan”). The Commodity Supplier’s repayment obligations under the Subordinated Loan Agreements are subordinate to the Commodity Supplier’s obligations under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement to the extent set forth in the SPE Master Custodial Agreement described below.

J. Aron will also make a cash equity contribution to the Commodity Supplier. The cash equity contribution, the amount of the Initial Term Loan and, if made, the amount of the Contingent Term Loan together equal at least three percent of the outstanding (unamortized) balance of the prepayment under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (approximately $ ______ million as of the Initial Issue Date).

**SPE Master Custodial Agreement.** The Commodity Supplier, J. Aron, NCEA and The Bank of New York Mellon, as custodian (the “SPE Master Custodian”), will enter into an SPE Master Custodial Agreement (the “SPE Master Custodial Agreement”) to administer:

(a) the amounts payable to the Commodity Supplier under (i) the Funding Agreement, (ii) the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, (iii) the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (iv) the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap and (v) the Subordinated Loan Agreements, and

(b) the Funding Agreement and the amounts payable by the Commodity Supplier under (i) the Commodity Purchase Agreement, (ii) the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, (iii) the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap and (iv) the Subordinated Loan Agreements.

The amounts payable to the Commodity Supplier under the Funding Agreement, the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement, the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap are to be paid directly into the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account.

Under the SPE Master Custodial Agreement, the SPE Master Custodian will, to the extent of the amounts on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account, make monthly transfers for the payment of

-52-
<!-- Page 607 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

amounts due by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Sale and Service Agreement. Following these monthly transfers, any remaining funds in the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account are transferred to the Commodity Supplier Capital Account. Pending their application, the amounts in the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account are held in trust for the benefit of the Commodity Supplier.

The Commodity Supplier Capital Account will be initially funded by J. Aron with the cash equity contribution and the Initial Term Loan under the Subordinated Loan Agreements. [From these sources, an amount equal to the Minimum Amount will be deposited in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account. Under the SPE Master Custodial Agreement, the amounts in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account may be invested only in direct obligations of the United States or obligations unconditionally guaranteed by the United States, in either case with a maturity of two years or less, certain certificates of deposit and demand deposits, certain money market funds and cash.

Amounts on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account shall be withdrawn by the SPE Master Custodian and applied: first, to the extent the SPE Master Custodian determines necessary to meet the Commodity Supplier’s collateral posting obligations under the credit support annex to the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap; and second to make up any deficiency of the amounts on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account for the purposes described above.

The SPE Master Custodian shall only withdraw amounts on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account for payment of principal and interest on the Subordinated Loan Agreements to the extent that the “Commodity Supplier Capital Amount” (defined below) exceeds the greater of (i) three percent of the outstanding (unamortized) balance of the prepayment under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and (ii) $[_____] after the monthly payments from the Commodity Supplier Revenue Account and the Commodity Supplier Capital Account described above. The SPE Master Custodian shall not be required to transfer any amount from the Commodity Supplier Capital Account for the monthly payment of principal and interest on the Subordinated Loan Agreements if the remaining balance in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account following such transfer will be less than $[____].

“Commodity Supplier Capital Amount” means, at any time, the sum of (y) amounts then on deposit in the Commodity Supplier Capital Account, and (z) all committed amounts then available for Commodity Supplier to draw under the Subordinated Loan Agreements, as notified by Commodity Supplier to the SPE Master Custodian from time to time.

The SPE Master Custodian shall have a lien, security interest and right of set-off against the Commodity Supplier Capital Account for the payment of any claim by the SPE Master Custodian for compensation, reimbursement or indemnity under the SPE Master Custodial Agreement.

Under no circumstance is the Commodity Supplier, J. Aron or GSG obligated to pay any amounts owed in respect of the Bonds.

GENERAL

As noted above, effective as of the Initial Issue Date: (a) NCEA’s 2018 swap agreement will be amended and restated to replace RBCEL with Royal Bank as the Commodity Swap Counterparty and to include notional quantities of Commodities with respect to the additional quantities of Commodities to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (as amended and restated, the “NCEA Commodity Swap”); (b) J. Aron will note and transfer all of its interests under its 2018 swap agreement with RBCEL to the Commodity Supplier; and (c) the Commodity Supplier’s 2018 swap agreement will be amended and restated to replace RBCEL with Royal Bank as the Commodity Swap Counterparty and to include notional quantities of Commodities with respect to the additional quantities Commodities to be delivered under the Commodity Purchase Agreement (as amended and restated, the “Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap”).

Gas Delivery Period. Commencing with gas deliveries for 20 __, NCEA will pay a floating natural gas price at a specified pricing point and will receive a fixed natural gas price for notional quantities that correspond to the quantities of natural gas and the related delivery point under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. Under the NCEA Commodity Swap, for each calendar month that the relevant floating price of natural gas at the delivery point is greater than the fixed price specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap, NCEA will be obligated to pay the Commodity Swap Counterparty an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the floating price and the fixed price multiplied by (y) a notional quantity equal to the quantity of gas scheduled to be delivered at the delivery point during such month by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the fixed price specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap is greater than the relevant floating price of natural gas at the delivery point for a month, the Commodity Swap Counterparty will be obligated to pay NCEA an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the fixed price and floating price multiplied by (y) a notional quantity equal to the quantity of gas scheduled to be delivered at the delivery point during such month by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the relevant floating price for a calendar month is equal to the specified fixed price, no payment will be owed by either party to the other under the NCEA Commodity Swap.

<!-- Page 609 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

Under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, the Commodity Supplier pays a fixed natural gas price and receives a floating natural gas price for the same notional quantities at the same pricing point.

**Electricity Delivery Period.** During the Electricity Delivery Period, the Commodity Swaps will be dormant and no payments will be required to be made under them to the extent that all of the Contract Quantities of electricity are fixed price Assigned Prepay Quantities. To the extent that Hourly Quantities of electricity are delivered by the Commodity Supplier, NCEA will pay a floating electricity price at a specified pricing point and will receive a fixed electricity price for notional quantities that correspond to the quantities of electricity and the related delivery point under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. Under the NCEA Commodity Swap, for each delivery hour that the relevant floating price of electricity at the delivery point is greater than the fixed price specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap, NCEA will be obligated to pay to the Commodity Swap Counterparty an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the floating price and the fixed price multiplied by (y) a notional quantity equal to the quantity of electricity scheduled to be delivered at the delivery point during such delivery hour by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the fixed price specified in the NCEA Commodity Swap is greater than the relevant floating price of electricity at the delivery point for a delivery hour, the Commodity Swap Counterparty will be obligated to pay NCEA an amount equal to the product of (x) the difference between the fixed and floating price multiplied by (y) a notional quantity equal to the quantity of electricity scheduled to be delivered at the delivery point during such delivery hour by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement. If the floating price for a delivery hour is equal to the specified fixed price, no payment will be owed by either party to the other under the NCEA Commodity Swap.

**Term.** Each of the Commodity Swaps has an initial term that commences on the date that Commodity deliveries begin under the amended and restated Commodity Purchase Agreement and extends for two calendar months. The Commodity Swaps have rolling two-month terms that renew automatically upon the payment due date of each monthly net settlement amount due thereunder through the term of the Gas Delivery Period (or Electricity Delivery Period, as applicable) under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, unless a Commodity Delivery Termination Date occurs under the Commodity Purchase Agreement.

**FORM OF COMMODITY SWAPS**

Each of the Commodity Swaps has been entered into as a confirmation under a 2002 ISDA Master Agreement with certain amendments and elections under the Master Agreement that have been agreed to by the parties.

**PAYMENT**

For each month of scheduled Commodities deliveries and notional amounts, each party with a net obligation under a Commodity Swap (based on the relative values of the fixed price and relevant index prices) will pay that net obligation to the other party. Payments under the Commodity Swaps are due in the calendar month following the month to which the applicable Commodity index prices relate, on the 24th day of the month (or preceding business day) in the case of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap and on the 25th day of the month (or next business day) in the case of the NCEA Commodity Swap.

# EARLY TERMINATION

Each of the Commodity Swaps will be subject to early termination under certain circumstances. Early termination can be triggered automatically or upon the election by the non-defaulting party as summarized below.

No settlement or other termination payment (other than Unpaid Amounts) will be due to any party as a result of any early termination of any Commodity Swap.

## Automatic Termination of Commodity Swaps

Each of the following events would result in the automatic termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap and the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap:

- the occurrence of a Commodity Delivery Termination Date under the Commodity Purchase Agreement for any reason, in which case the Commodity Swaps will terminate automatically on such date; and
- delivery by NCEA of a notice of termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap results in the automatic termination of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap, and delivery by the Commodity Supplier of a notice of termination of the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap results in the automatic termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap.

## Elective Termination of the NCEA Commodity Swap

Each of the following events of default and termination events would provide the non-defaulting party or the affected party the right to terminate the NCEA Commodity Swap if it is not cured within the applicable cure period:

**Other Listed Events.** The Commodity Swaps contain other listed events (including breach or repudiation, misrepresentation, illegality and certain tax and credit events) that do not give NCEA, the Commodity Supplier or the Commodity Swap Counterparty the right to designate an early termination date, but which permit the non-defaulting party or the affected party to pursue such equitable remedies, including specific performance, as may be available.

**Replacement of Commodity Swaps.** See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Replacement of Commodity Swaps” and “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS—Enforcement of Project Agreements—NCLA Commodity Swap” for a description of certain provisions of the Indenture and the Commodity Purchase Agreement regarding the replacement of a Commodity Swap that is terminated or subject to termination.

**CUSTODIAL AGREEMENT**

As noted above, J. Aron and RBCEL will novate all of their interests under an existing custodial agreement to the Commodity Supplier and Royal Bank as the Commodity Swap Counterparty, respectively (the -57-
<!-- Page 612 -->
```
“Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement”), which provides for the administration of payments under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee and as custodian (in such capacity, the “Custodian”). The Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement contains certain provisions designed to mitigate risks to NCEA and Bondholders resulting from a failure of the Commodity Swap Counterparty to make payments to NCEA under the NCEA Commodity Swap.

Payments made by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap will be made to a custodial account maintained by the Custodian under the Commodity Supplier Custodial Agreement. Such amounts will not be released until the Custodian has received confirmation that the amount payable to NCEA by the Commodity Swap Counterparty under the NCEA Commodity Swap for such month has been paid. If the Commodity Swap Counterparty does not make a required payment under the NCEA Commodity Swap and such payment remains unpaid after the expiration of any grace period, the Custodian will pay the amount that the Commodity Supplier paid under the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap (which such amount is held in custody) to the Trustee for deposit in the Revenue Fund and that payment will be treated as a Commodity Swap Receipt. Additionally, if the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap terminates, the Commodity Supplier will continue to make payments to the custodial account as if the Commodity Supplier Commodity Swap were still in effect until the earlier of (i) replacement of the Commodity Swaps in accordance with the requirements of the Commodity Purchase Agreement and (ii) termination of the Delivery Period under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, and such payments will be used to ensure that NCEA receives deposits in the Revenue Fund as described in the preceding sentence in the event that the Commodity Swap Counterparty does not make a required payment under the NCEA Commodity Swap.

following the Project Participant’s receipt of NCEA’s billing statement (or if either such day is not a business day, the preceding business day). If the Project Participant disputes the appropriateness of any charge or calculation in any billing statement, the Project Participant still must pay (absent manifest error) all amounts billed by NCEA, including any amounts in dispute, and must object to such billing statement within two years after the applicable month of delivery. If it is ultimately determined that the Project Participant did not owe the disputed amount, NCEA must pay the Project Participant the disputed amount plus interest.

**ANNUAL REFUNDS**

NCEA has agreed to provide annual refunds to the Project Participant from amounts available for distribution pursuant to the Indenture. In determining the amount of such refunds, NCEA may reserve such funds as may be required under the terms of the Indenture or as it deems reasonably necessary and appropriate to cover anticipated costs and expenses to be incurred in the next succeeding bond year, with certain limitations.

**COVENANTS OF THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT**

**Operating Expense.** The Project Participant has agreed to make payments under the Commodity Supply Contract from the revenues of its electric utility system as an operating expense of its electric utility system.

**Maintenance of Rates and Charges.** The Project Participant has covenanted and agreed that it will fix, prescribe, maintain, and collect rates, fees, and charges for the electricity or services furnished by its electric utility system so as to provide revenues sufficient to enable it to pay all amounts payable under the Commodity Supply Contract and all other amounts payable from the revenues of the Project Participant’s electric system, and to maintain any required reserves.

**Pledge of Electric System Revenues.** The Project Participant agrees that it will not grant any lien on or security interest in, or otherwise pledge or encumber, the revenues of its electric utility system that would create a lien, pledge or other encumbrance having priority over the obligations of the Project Participant to pay the amounts due to NCEA under the Commodity Supply Agreement.

**Tax-Exempt Status of Bonds.** The Project Participant acknowledges that the Bonds will be issued with the intention that the interest thereon will be exempt from federal taxes under Section 103 of the Code. Accordingly, the Project Participant agrees that it will (a) provide such information with respect to its utility system as may be requested by NCEA in order to establish the tax-exempt status of the Bonds, and (b) act in accordance with such written instructions as NCEA may provide from time to time in order to maintain the tax-exempt status of the Bonds. The Project Participant further agrees that it will not at any time take any action, or fail to take any action, that would adversely affect the tax-exempt status of the Bonds.

Without limiting the foregoing, the Project Participant has further agreed, subject to certain remediation rights, to use the Commodities purchased under the Commodity Supply Contract (a) in a “qualifying use” as defined in the applicable Treasury Regulations, (b) in a manner that will not result in any “private business use” within the meaning of Section 141 of the Code, and (c) in a manner consistent with its Federal Tax Certificate (collectively, the “Qualifying Use Requirements”).

**Remediation.** The Project Participant may at times need to remarket, or inadvertently remarket, Commodities received under the Commodity Supply Contract in a manner that does not comply with Qualifying Use Requirements.
<!-- Page 615 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Page)  

Use Requirements due to daily and hourly fluctuations in the Project Participant’s Commodity needs. To the extent the Project Participant does so, the Project Participant shall, to the extent possible, use the proceeds of such remarketing to purchase Commodities (other than Priority Commodities) that the Project Participant uses in compliance with the Qualifying Use Requirements not later than the end of the semi-annual period in which such proceeds were received. To track compliance with these requirements, the Project Participant will provide a semi-annual report to NCEA (delivered not later than the fifteenth day of each April and October until the end of the Delivery Period) showing the following: the total quantity of proceeds from sales of Commodities received under the Commodity Supply Contract that (a) were sold by the Project Participant to any person other than a Municipal Utility and (b) have not been remediated by the Project Participant by applying such proceeds to purchase gas or electricity that is used in compliance with the Qualifying Use Requirements.

**TRANSPORTATION; TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS**

Except as otherwise provided in the Commodity Supply Contract, NCEA must make arrangements for all transportation and transmission services required to effect, and must bear all costs and expenses of, transportation and transmission prior to the delivery of the Contract Quantity at the applicable delivery point specified in the Commodity Supply Contract. The Project Participant must make all arrangements for all transportation and transmission services required to receive the Contract Quantity at such delivery point and to transport it from such delivery point.

Title to the Commodities delivered under the Commodity Supply Contract and risk of loss pass from NCEA to the Project Participant at the applicable delivery point; provided that the title and risk of loss for Assigned Gas and Assigned Electricity shall be in accordance with the applicable Gas Assignment Agreement or PPA Assignment Agreement. With respect to gas, NCEA will be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession of gas prior to the time of delivery to the Project Participant at the delivery point, and the Project Participant will be deemed to be in exclusive control and possession of gas thereafter.

**FAILURE TO PERFORM**

Except in the case of a “Force Majeure” event, for each Commodity Unit that NCEA is obligated to deliver to the Project Participant but fails to deliver, NCEA must pay to the Project Participant an amount equal to the difference between the Contract Price per Commodity Unit which would have been applicable to the undelivered Commodity and any higher cost per Commodity Unit which the Project Participant actually incurred to obtain an equivalent quantity of replacement gas or electricity.

In the event that NCEA tenders the Contract Quantity for delivery to the Project Participant and the Project Participant fails to take the full amount of the Contract Quantity (except in the case of a “Force Majeure” event, described below), the Project Participant will remain obligated to pay NCEA the Contract Price for the full amount of the Contract Quantity. NCEA will credit to the Project Participant’s account the net amount described under the heading “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing.”

**REMARKETING OF COMMODITIES**

decreased gas requirements due to reduced generation requirements during the Gas Delivery Period, (ii) decreased demand by the Project Participant’s retail customers or (iii) a change in law, or (b) makes a Remarketing Election for any Reset Period (as described under “THE COMMODITY PROJECT—Re-Pricing Agreement”), NCEA will arrange for the sale by the Commodity Supplier of the affected quantities of Commodities to another Municipal Utility or other purchaser pursuant to the remarketing provisions of the Commodity Purchase Agreement; provided that, in the case of a remarketing request to the Commodity Supplier under clause (a)(iii) above, notice of such a remarketing must be provided at least six months in advance as set forth in the Commodity Purchase Agreement and the Commodity Supplier must consent to such a remarketing, with such consent to be provided in its sole discretion. Under the Commodity Purchase Agreement, NCEA arranges for sales through the Commodity Supplier in accordance with the remarketing provisions and procedures set forth in that agreement. Except in the case of a Remarketing Election given by the Project Participant, if the Commodity Supplier successfully makes such a sale or sales, NCEA must credit, in circumstances described in the Commodity Supply Contract, against the amount owed by the Project Participant for such gas revenues received by NCEA from the sales of such gas less all directly incurred costs or expenses (which include remarketing fees paid to the Commodity Supplier), but in no event more than the Contract Price. If the Project Participant that makes a Remarketing Election in accordance with the provisions of the Commodity Supply Contract, it will have no obligation to purchase or receive Commodities, and NCEA shall have no obligation to sell or deliver Commodities, under the Commodity Supply Contract, during the applicable Reset Period.

See “THE COMMODITY PURCHASE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing” and “THE COMMODITY SALE AND SERVICE AGREEMENT—Commodity Remarketing.”

FORCE MAJEURE

Except with regard to a party’s obligation to make payments under the Commodity Supply Contract that are then due or becoming due with respect to performance prior to the Force Majeure, neither party shall be liable to the other for failure to perform its obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract to the extent such failure was caused by an event of “Force Majeure,” which is defined in the Commodity Supply Contract during the Gas Delivery Period as (i) physical events such as acts of God, landslides, lightning, earthquakes, fires, storms or storm warnings, such as hurricanes, which result in evacuation of the affected area, floods, washouts, explosions, breakage or accident or necessity of repairs to machinery or equipment or lines of pipe; (ii) weather related events affecting an entire geographic region, such as low temperatures which cause freezing or failure of wells or lines of pipe; (iii) interruption and/or curtailment of transportation and/or storage by Transporters (provided that if the affected Party is using interruptible or secondary Firm transportation, only if primary, in-path, Firm transportation is also curtailed by the same event, or, if the relevant Transporter does not curtail based on path, if primary Firm transportation is also curtailed); (iv) acts of others such as strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances, riots, sabotage, insurrections, wars or acts of terror; and (v) governmental actions such as necessity for compliance with Law promulgated by a government agency having jurisdiction.

During the Electricity Delivery Period, “Force Majeure” means an event or circumstance which prevents one party from performing its obligations under the Commodity Supply Contract, which event or circumstance was not anticipated as of date of execution of the Commodity Supply Contract, which is not within the reasonable control of, or the result of the negligence of, the party claiming Force Majeure, and which, by the exercise of due diligence, the claiming party is unable to overcome or avoid or cause to be avoided.

<!-- Page 617 -->
In addition, any invocation of Force Majeure by the Commodity Supplier under the Commodity Purchase Agreement constitutes Force Majeure under the Commodity Supply Contract.

**DEFAULT AND REMEDIES**

**NCEA Default.** Each of the following events constitute a “NCEA Default” under the Commodity Supply Contract:

(a) any representation or warranty made by NCEA in the Commodity Supply Contract proves to have been incorrect in any material respect when made; or

(b) NCEA fails to perform, observe or comply with any covenant, agreement or term contained in the Commodity Supply Contract, and such failure continues for more than 30 days following the earlier of (i) receipt by NCEA of notice thereof or (ii) an officer of NCEA becoming aware of such default;

**Project Participant Default.** Each of the following events shall constitute a “Project Participant Default” under the Commodity Supply Contract:

(a) the Project Participant fails to pay when due any amounts owed to NCEA pursuant to the Commodity Supply Contract and such failure continues for one business day following the earlier of (i) receipt by the Project Participant of notice thereof or (ii) an officer of the Project Participant becoming aware of such default;

(b) the Project Participant’s insolvency or bankruptcy;

(c) any representation or warranty made by the Project Participant in the Commodity Supply Contract proves to have been incorrect in any material respect when made; or

**GENERAL**

SMUD and SFA formed NCEA by their execution of a Joint Powers Agreement, dated as of November 8, 2018 (the “Joint Powers Agreement”). SFA is itself a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and the Modesto Irrigation District in 1992. NCEA has the power, among others, under the Act and the Joint Powers Agreement to take all action necessary or convenient to assist SMUD in the acquisition and financing of supplies of natural gas and electricity.

**GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT**

Under the Joint Powers Agreement, the Board of Directors of SMUD is the governing body (the “Commission”) of NCEA. The current members of the Commission are listed in APPENDIX B under the caption “INTRODUCTION—Independent Governance.” Certain of SMUD’s officers, including its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Controller and Secretary, jointly serve in the same or similar capacities as officers of NCEA. NCEA has no independent employees. The Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of SMUD serves as general counsel to NCEA.

Pursuant to the Joint Powers Agreement, SMUD will provide or cause to be provided such technical and general and administrative services as NCEA may reasonably require. NCEA may reimburse SMUD for its actual costs of providing such services. Although SMUD has provided and will continue to provide NCEA with staffing and consultant support pursuant to the Joint Powers Agreement SMUD does not have any obligation or liability to NCEA beyond that specifically provided in the Joint Powers Agreement and the Commodity Supply Contract. SFA and the Modesto Irrigation District have no obligations or liabilities to NCEA.

**LIMITED LIABILITY**

THE BONDS DO NOT CONSTITUTE A DEBT OR LIABILITY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF (INCLUDING THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT), OTHER THAN NCEA, BUT SHALL BE PAYABLE SOLELY FROM THE FUNDS PROVIDED THEREFOR UNDER THE INDENTURE. NCEA SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO PAY THE PRINCIPAL OR REDEMPTION PRICE OF OR INTEREST ON THE BONDS, EXCEPT FROM THE FUNDS PROVIDED THEREFOR UNDER THE INDENTURE AND NEITHER THE FAITH AND CREDIT NOR THE TAXING POWER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR OF ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF, INCLUDING NCEA, OR OF THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT IS PLEDGED TO THE PAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OR REDEMPTION PRICE OF AND INTEREST ON THE BONDS. THE ISSUANCE OF THE BONDS SHALL NOT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OR CONTINGENTLY OBLIGATE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR ANY POLITICAL SUBDIVISION THEREOF (INCLUDING THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT) TO LEVY OR TO PLEDGE ANY FORM OF TAXATION OR TO MAKE ANY APPROPRIATION FOR THEIR PAYMENT. NCEA HAS NO TAXING POWER.

**CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING NCEA AND THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT**

**GENERAL**

Various factors will affect the operations of NCEA and Project Participant, including, for example:

- retention of existing customers by the Project Participant; 

-65-
<!-- Page 620 -->
- local, regional and national economic conditions;
- the market price of gas, electricity and the market price of alternate forms of energy;
- fuel conservation measures;
- the availability of alternate energy sources;
- climatic conditions;
- government regulation and deregulation of the energy industry;
- federal and state regulation of, and private sector initiatives to limit, greenhouse gas emissions; and
- technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices.

NCEA is unable to predict the impact of the foregoing factors, and other factors, on the Project Participant and their respective gas and electricity system operations. However, the gas and electricity supply and services to be provided by NCEA are intended to maintain and improve the competitive position of the Project Participant by providing them with additional services and competitive prices for a portion of their gas supply.

## DISRUPTIONS IN THE NATURAL GAS MARKET

The Project Participant engages in various transactions in the natural gas markets, including the purchase and sale of natural gas and transactions to hedge their exposure to changes in the market price of natural gas. The ability of the Project Participant to enter into these transactions is dependent upon a variety of factors, including most notably prevailing conditions in the natural gas market.

At various times in the past, the natural gas market experienced severe disruptions, including extremely high and volatile commodity prices, inverted forward price curves and constrained transportation and sources of supply. The factors giving rise to these conditions — demands for gas and other forms of energy, economic conditions, weather patterns, inadequate regulation by federal and state authorities, and the exercise of market power and the manipulation of the gas markets by marketers or others are beyond the control of NCEA and the Project Participant. To the extent that disruptions in the natural gas market prevent the Project Participant from engaging in those transactions that are necessary to enable it to manage risks, its financial and operating position may be adversely affected.

On February 13 through February 17, 2021, a major winter and ice storm had widespread impacts across the central, southeastern and eastern United States, northern Mexico, and parts of Canada (“Winter Storm Uri”), which resulted in electricity blackouts for over 9.9 million people in the United States and contributed to significant shortages of, and substantially increased costs for, natural gas across the United States. [NCEA did not experience any material supply or payment disruptions under its long-term supply and sales contracts due to the events of Winter Storm Uri.] 

-66-
<!-- Page 621 -->
On February 24, 2022, Russia commenced a military invasion of Ukraine. The invasion, subsequent economic sanctions imposed by nations opposed to the invasion, and reductions and suspensions of Russian gas deliveries impacted global natural gas markets and resulted in significant increases in the market price of natural gas in the United States. While these impacts have subsided, it is not possible to predict the ongoing effects of the continuing military conflict in Ukraine on natural gas markets and gas prices:

THE PROJECT PARTICIPANT  
For information regarding Sacramento Municipal Utility District, see APPENDIX B—INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT.

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE  
NCEA, the Project Participant and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., will enter into a Continuing Disclosure Agreement (the “Undertaking”) for the benefit of the beneficial owners of the Bonds to send certain information annually and to provide notice of certain events to the MSRB’s EMMA system for municipal securities disclosures, pursuant to the requirements of Section (b)(5) of Rule 15c2-12 (“Rule 15c2-12”) adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

A failure by NCEA or the Project Participant to comply with the Undertaking will not constitute an event of default under the Indenture, the Bonds or the Commodity Supply Contract, and Beneficial Owners of the Bonds shall only be entitled to the remedies for any such failure described in the Undertaking. A failure by NCEA or the Project Participant to comply with certain provisions of the Undertaking must be reported in accordance with Rule 15c2-12 and must be considered by any broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer before recommending the purchase or sale of the Bonds in the secondary market. Consequently, such a failure may adversely affect the transferability and liquidity of the Bonds and their market price.

The Undertaking and commitments of NCEA and the Project Participant described under this heading and in APPENDIX E hereto to furnish the above-described documents and information are agreements and commitments solely of NCEA and the Project Participant, and the Underwriter has no responsibility to ensure that NCEA and the Project Participant comply with the Undertaking and such commitments. In addition, the Underwriter makes no representation that any such documents or information will be furnished, or that any such documents or information so furnished will be accurate or complete, or sufficient for the purposes for which they may be used.

NCEA and the Project Participant report that there have been no instances in the five years previous to the date of this Official Statement in which they failed to comply in all material respects with their prior continuing disclosure undertakings pursuant to Rule 15c2-12. [NTD: update/confirm]

NCEA and the Project Participant have adopted a written policy that sets forth procedures for compliance with the federal tax and continuing disclosure requirements applicable to its bonds. The policy includes, among other things, procedures that are intended to promote NCEA and the Project Participant’s compliance with the Undertaking.

The financial statements of NCEA which comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of revenue and expenses and changes in net position and cash flows for the years then ended and the related notes to the financial statements, have been audited by Baker Tilly US, LLP of Madison, Wisconsin, independent auditors as stated in their report. The financial statements of NCEA as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are attached as APPENDIX A. Baker Tilly US, LLP has not been engaged to perform, and has not performed, since the date of its report included herein, any procedures on the financial statements addressed in that report. Baker Tilly US, LLP also has not performed any procedures relating to this Official Statement.

**FINANCIAL ADVISOR**

NCEA has retained PFM Financial Advisors LLC, as financial advisor (the “Financial Advisor”), in connection with various matters relating to the issuance of the Bonds. While the Financial Advisor assisted in the review and preparation of this Official Statement and in other matters relating to the planning, structuring and issuance of the Bonds, the Financial Advisor assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the information contained in this Official Statement. The Financial Advisor is an independent advisory firm and is not engaged in underwriting or distributing securities. The Financial Advisor will receive compensation that is contingent upon the sale, issuance and delivery of the Bonds.

**UNDERWRITING**

Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (the “Underwriter”) has entered into a purchase contract relating to the Bonds with NCEA, pursuant to which the Underwriter has agreed, subject to certain conditions, to purchase the Bonds from NCEA at an aggregate purchase price of $________ (representing the principal amount of the Bonds, plus original issue premium of $________, less an underwriter’s discount of $________). The obligation of the Underwriter to purchase the Bonds is subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the purchase contract. The Underwriter is obligated to purchase all the Bonds if any are purchased. The Bonds may be offered and sold to certain dealers and others at prices lower than the initial offering prices, and such initial offering prices may be changed from time to time by the Underwriter. The Underwriter has no obligations other than those that are set forth in the purchase contract. The payment of the Bonds is not guaranteed by the Underwriter.

<!-- Page 624 -->
![Tax Matters](https://example.com/image.png)

NCEA has furnished to each rating agency expected to rate the bonds being offered certain information, including information not included in this Official Statement, about NCEA and the Bonds. Generally, rating agencies base their ratings on that information and on independent investigations, studies and assumptions made by each rating agency. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. There is no assurance that a rating, once obtained, will continue for any given period of time or that it will not be revised downward or withdrawn entirely if, in the opinion of the rating agency, circumstances so warrant. Any such downward revision or withdrawal could have an adverse effect on the marketability or market price of the Bonds. NCEA has not undertaken any responsibility after issuance of the Bonds to assure the maintenance of the ratings applicable thereto or to oppose any revision or withdrawal of such ratings.

## TAX MATTERS

**[TBU by Bond Counsel]**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to NCEA (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Code, and the Bonds and interest thereon are exempt from all state, county, municipal and other taxation in the State of California. Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the Bonds included in a financial statement income of certain corporations may be subject to the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in APPENDIX F hereto.

The Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than their principal amount payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier call date) (“Premium Bonds”) will be treated as having amortizable bond premium. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the case of bonds, like the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. However, the amount of tax-exempt interest received, and a Beneficial Owner’s basis in a Premium Bond, will be reduced by the amount of amortizable bond premium properly allocable to such Beneficial Owner. Beneficial Owners of Premium Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in their particular circumstances.

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds. NCEA and SMUD have made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the Bonds. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken), or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds.
<!-- Page 625 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds may otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. The nature and extent of these other tax consequences depend upon the particular tax status of the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial Owner’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may cause interest on the Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent Beneficial Owners from realizing the full benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals, clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the Bonds. Prospective purchasers of the Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, and regarding the impact of future legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of NCEA or SMUD, or about the effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. NCEA and SMUD must comply with the requirements of the Code.

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the Bonds and the issuance of the Bonds, and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend NCEA, SMUD or the Beneficial Owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, parties other than NCEA, SMUD and their appointed counsel, including the Beneficial Owners, would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in connection with an audit examination of tax-exempt bonds is difficult, obtaining an independent review of IRS positions with which NCEA or SMUD legitimately disagrees may not be practicable. Any action of the IRS, including but not limited to selection of the Bonds for audit, or the course or result of such audit, or an audit of bonds presenting similar tax issues, may affect the market price for, or the marketability of, the Bonds, and may cause NCEA, SMUD or the Beneficial Owners to incur significant expense.

Payments on the Bonds generally will be subject to U.S. information reporting and possibly to “backup withholding.” Under Section 3406 of the Code and applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, a non-corporate Beneficial Owner of Bonds may be subject to backup withholding with respect to “reportable payments,” which include interest paid on the Bonds and the gross proceeds of a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of the Bonds. The payee will be required to deduct and withhold the prescribed amounts if (i) the payee fails to furnish a U.S. taxpayer identification number (“TIN”) to the payor in the manner required, (ii) the IRS notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is incorrect, (iii) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the Code or (iv) the payee fails to certify under penalty of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding under Section 3406(a)(1)(C) of the Code. Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a Beneficial Owner’s federal income tax liability, if any, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

# INTRODUCTION

## General

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) owns and operates an electric system that has provided retail electric service since 1946. SMUD’s current service area is approximately 900 square miles, and includes the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. See “THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM – The Service Area.”

## Independent Governance

SMUD is an independently run community-owned organization. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government.

SMUD is governed by a Board of Directors (the “Board”), which consists of seven directors elected by ward for staggered four-year terms. The Board determines policy and appoints the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, who is responsible for SMUD’s overall management and day-to-day operations. The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager is responsible for the hiring and removal of all employees, other than the Chief Legal and Government Affairs Officer and General Counsel, the Internal Auditor and the Special Assistant to the Board, who are hired and may be removed only by the Board. The employment status of nearly all SMUD employees is governed by a civil service system administered by the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager.

The Board elects its President and Vice President annually to take office in January. The current members of the Board are as follows:

| Name                     | Occupation                                               | Ward  | Term Expires     |

**THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM**

**The Service Area**

SMUD is the primary distributor of electric power within an area of approximately 900 square miles in central California. The service area includes the State Capital, Sacramento, the populous areas principally to the northeast and south of the City of Sacramento (the “City” or “Sacramento”) and the agricultural areas to the north and south. The City is located 85 miles northeast of San Francisco.

SMUD’s electric system supplies power to a population of approximately 1.5 million with a total annual retail load of approximately 10,104 million kilowatt-hours (“kWh”) for the year ended December 31, 2023. As the capital of the nation’s most populous state, Sacramento benefits from the historically stabilizing influence of a large government sector. Sacramento is home to the State government headquarters, the Sacramento County seat, the City government and various special districts that combine to make government the largest single employment sector in the Sacramento area. Information technology, transportation, education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and construction round out the other major sectors of employment and industry in the area.

SMUD’s annual peak load has averaged 3,045 Megawatts (“MW”) over the last three years, with SMUD’s record peak load of 3,299 MW occurring on July 24, 2006. In 2022, SMUD recorded its second highest peak load of 3,263 MW. SMUD reviews its load forecast, at a minimum, on an annual basis.

![The Electric System](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=The+Electric+System)

**The Electric System**

SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities.

SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through a 230 kilovolt (“kV”) and 115 kV transmission system. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) and the Western Area Power Administration (“WAPA”). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system with the exception of the City’s downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission system. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV substations with overhead and underground 12 kV distribution circuits.

**BUSINESS STRATEGY**

**General**

SMUD’s Board of Directors has established the following purpose and vision statements: “SMUD’s purpose is to enhance the quality of life for our customers and community by providing reliable and affordable electricity, and leading the transition to a clean energy future. SMUD’s vision is to be a trusted and powerful partner in achieving an inclusive, zero carbon economy. SMUD will leverage its relationships to accelerate innovation, ensure energy affordability and reliability, protect the environment, eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, catalyze economic and workforce development, promote environmental justice, and enhance community vitality for all.” The Board has adopted a set of Strategic Directions with related metrics, which it considers essential for the success of SMUD and for serving SMUD’s customers. These include competitive rates, access to credit markets, reliability, customer relations, environmental leadership, resource planning, enterprise risk management and safety. Some of the general elements in SMUD’s business strategy are:

- developing and maintaining a sustainable and reliable power supply to meet demand growth consistent with State mandates and the Board’s directions for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions to zero by 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”;
- working closely with customers to provide the information, tools and incentives to assist them to more efficiently manage energy use, which will contribute to meeting greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission targets and managing needle peak demand requirements (those 40 or so hours of the year with extreme temperatures when customer demand surges by up to 400 additional MW);
- managing price, volumetric and credit risks associated with energy and natural gas procurement;
- attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, skilled and engaged workforce that reflects SMUD’s values and is committed to achieving SMUD’s mission;
- retaining local decision making authority and operational independence; and
- collaborating regionally to attract new businesses and grow existing business to diversify and strengthen the Sacramento economy.

SMUD’s long-range business strategy focuses in part on ensuring financial stability by establishing rates that provide an acceptable fixed charge coverage ratio on a consolidated basis, taking into consideration the impact of capital expenditures and other factors on cash flow. SMUD’s Board policy sets

with current energy market prices. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges.”

**Renewable Options.** SMUD’s customers have been increasingly interested in distributed energy resources, mainly through the installation of solar systems. As of December 2023, approximately 51,374 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, approximately 8% of retail customers, had installed solar systems, representing approximately 360 MW of solar installations.

As the cost of energy storage continues to decline, SMUD anticipates an increase in behind-the-meter energy storage, mainly through the installation of battery storage systems. As of December 2023, approximately 1,532 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, had installed storage systems, representing approximately 10 MW of storage.

As another option for solar, SMUD’s SolarShares® pilot program (the “SolarShares Pilot”) was established as a cost-effective and convenient way for commercial customers to meet their energy needs from solar power. The SolarShares Pilot offered SMUD commercial customers the opportunity to receive solar power without upfront costs or equipment installation through 5-, 10- or 20-year purchase contracts. Customers that entered into purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot receive up to half of their power from a utility-scale solar system. SMUD supplies solar power for the SolarShares Pilot either by building and maintaining utility-scale solar systems or by procuring solar power from third parties through power purchase agreements. The SolarShares Pilot generation was approximately 3.2% of retail sales in 2023. As of April 30, 2021, SMUD had completed the SolarShares Pilot and is not entering into new purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot.

Since January 2020, the California Building Code has required all new constructed residential buildings under three stories to be powered by photovoltaic solar systems. A new home satisfies this requirement if it installs on-site solar or participates in an approved community solar or energy storage program. In February 2020, SMUD obtained approval from the California Energy Commission (“CEC”) to administer its own community solar program, called Neighborhood SolarShares® (“Neighborhood SolarShares”). SMUD’s Neighborhood SolarShares program can be used by developers of new low-rise residential buildings to satisfy the mandatory solar requirement. See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Rooftop Solar Mandate.” Starting in 2023, the California Building Code’s mandatory solar requirement extends beyond low-rise residential properties, and other changes to the California Building Code’s community solar regulations took effect. SMUD revised its program to align with the new regulations and, in May 2023, obtained approval from the CEC to continue offering its Neighborhood SolarShares compliance option to newly constructed low rise residential homes in its service territory.

In addition to the SolarShares Pilot and Neighborhood SolarShares, SMUD maintains a voluntary green energy pricing program called Greenergy® (“Greenery”). The Greenery program allows customers the opportunity to pay an additional amount per month to ensure that either all or part of their electricity comes from green or carbon free energy sources. In 2023, the program allocated Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) equivalent to approximately 4.2% of retail sales to its participating customers.

**Energy Efficiency.** To further assist customers in managing energy use and reducing regional carbon emissions and air pollution, SMUD offers an extensive array of energy efficiency and building electrification programs and services including financial incentives, loans, energy audits and education. In addition, SMUD has partnered with local developers to incorporate energy efficiency and all-electric construction measures into new residential and commercial construction, which helps developers plan and design efficient, cost-effective and low or zero-emission buildings. As part of SMUD’s 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), SMUD set a goal for regional carbon emissions through transport and building

# Electrification and Sustainable Power Supply

Electrification aims to reduce carbon emissions in buildings and transport by 64% over the next 20 years. SMUD’s focus on electrification is continued in the Zero Carbon Plan (defined and discussed below). SMUD was the first electric utility in the country to set its efficiency goals based on carbon reductions, allowing building electrification and energy efficiency to both count toward meeting SMUD’s efficiency goals. This is a significant opportunity, as converting a typical home today to all-electric saves more than three times the carbon emissions compared to doing a major energy efficiency upgrade alone to the same building. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources.”

## Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission

Maintaining a sustainable power supply entails focusing efforts on researching, promoting and implementing new renewable energy technologies and sources to meet SMUD’s long-term commitment to reducing carbon emissions and providing a reliable energy supply. SMUD defines a sustainable power supply as one that reduces SMUD’s GHG emissions to serve retail customer load to zero by 2030. See “– 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”. SMUD is planning to achieve zero GHG emissions to serve retail customer load through investments in energy efficiency, clean distributed energy resources, renewables portfolio standard (“RPS”) eligible renewables, energy storage, large hydroelectric generation, clean and emissions free fuels, carbon capture and sequestration, and new technologies and business models. Additionally, SMUD plans to continue pursuing GHG emissions reductions through vehicle, building and equipment electrification. At the same time, SMUD’s plans for maintaining a sustainable power supply include assuring the reliability of SMUD’s electric system, minimizing environmental impacts on land, habitat, water and air quality, and maintaining competitive rates relative to other electric providers in the State.

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills regulate GHG emissions and promote the development of sustainable generation alternatives, principally through more stringent RPS. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings” herein.

### 2030 Zero Carbon Plan

In July 2020, the Board declared a climate emergency and adopted a resolution calling for SMUD to take significant and consequential actions to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030. On April 28, 2021, the Board approved SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (the “Zero Carbon Plan”). The Zero Carbon Plan is intended to be a flexible roadmap for SMUD to eliminate carbon emissions from its electricity production by 2030 while maintaining reliable and affordable service. To achieve these goals the Zero Carbon Plan is focused on four main areas: natural gas generation repurposing, proven technologies, new technologies and business models and financial impacts and options. SMUD plans to revisit the Zero Carbon Plan annually.

The natural gas generation repurposing focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for exploring the replacement of two of SMUD’s five Local Gas-Fired Plants (as defined herein) and the retooling of the other three Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” Based on SMUD’s studies to date, SMUD estimates that McClellan (as defined herein) and the Campbell Soup Project (as defined herein) can be replaced in the next several years depending on SMUD’s success with replacement resources. Final decisions about the replacement of these two Local Gas-Fired Plants will be based on additional reliability studies and engagement with the community. As part of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is also exploring converting the Carson Project (as defined herein) and the Procter & Gamble Project (as defined herein) to reliability use operations only and investigating the use of alternative fuels like Renewable Natural Gas-biomethane (RNG-biomanthene), hydrogen and other biofuels for the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, and the Consumers Power Plant (as defined herein). In addition, SMUD is investigating new technologies such as long duration energy storage, carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and other clean fuel alternatives to help support.

the reduction of GHG emissions in SMUD’s energy supply. All final generator configurations are subject to reliability assessments.

The proven clean technologies focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for SMUD to procure approximately 1,100 to 1,500 MW of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (“PV”) generating capacity, 700 to 1,100 MW of local utility-scale battery storage, 300 to 500 MW of wind generating capacity, and 100 to 220 MW of geothermal generating capacity. The Zero Carbon Plan also estimates that customer installation of approximately 500 to 750 MW of behind-the-meter solar PV generating capacity and approximately 50 to 250 MW of behind-the-meter battery storage will assist SMUD with achieving the Zero Carbon Plan goals.

With respect to new technologies and business models, the Zero Carbon Plan focuses on evaluating, prioritizing and scaling the emerging technologies that SMUD expects will have the largest impact on reducing carbon in SMUD’s 2030 resource mix. SMUD is currently focused on various areas of technology and customer-focused programs, including electrification, demand flexibility, virtual power plants, vehicle-to-grid technology, and new grid-scale technologies. The Zero Carbon Plan forecasts that customer-owned devices and SMUD customer-focused programs will contribute between 360 and 1,300 MW of capacity to SMUD’s grid by 2030.

The financial impacts and options focus of the Zero Carbon Plan aims to keep SMUD rate increases at or below the rate of inflation while achieving SMUD’s goal of eliminating carbon emissions from its power supply by 2030. To pay for the expected costs of the Zero Carbon Plan and keep rate increases at or below the rate of inflation, the Zero Carbon Plan estimates the need for SMUD to realize between $50 million and $150 million of sustained annual savings. SMUD currently plans to achieve these sustained annual savings by exploring the implementation of operational savings and pursuing partnership and grant opportunities.

While the ultimate impacts of the Zero Carbon Plan on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy from clean technologies, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers, such impacts could be material.

Renewable Energy and Climate Change. The California Renewable Energy Resources Act, established by Senate Bill X1-2 (“SBX1-2”) and the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, enacted by Senate Bill 350 (“SB 350”) require that SMUD meets 33% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2020 and 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2030. Senate Bill 100 (“SB 100”), passed by the legislature and approved by then-Governor Brown on September 10, 2018, accelerates the RPS targets and establishes a new 60% target by 2030. The bill also created a planning goal to meet all of the State’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Renewables Portfolio Standards” for a discussion of the State RPS requirements.

SMUD’s compliance with State RPS requirements is evaluated over 3- or 4-year compliance periods. SMUD met the State RPS requirements for the first compliance period (2011-2013) and second compliance period (2014-2016). The third compliance period (2017-2020) required SMUD to source one-third of its energy from renewable resources, and SMUD had sufficient RECs to meet the third compliance period requirements. SMUD filed its 2020 and third compliance period RPS compliance report with the CEC in the second quarter of 2021 and the CEC adopted SMUD’s third compliance period verification report in December 2023. SMUD expects the confirmation letter from the CEC indicating that SMUD was A-9

in full compliance with its third compliance period RPS obligations in the first quarter of 2024. As of the end of the third compliance period (2020), SMUD had approximately one million surplus RECs available to help meet future RPS targets. SMUD expects to file its 2023 RPS compliance report by July 1, 2024, showing that SMUD will have provided approximately 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources in 2023, which is greater than the interim 2023 RPS target of 41.25%. RPS compliance is determined by compliance period and not by individual years and SMUD anticipates having sufficient surplus procured and/or under contract resources in the fourth compliance period (2021-2024) to be in compliance with the RPS requirements. In addition to meeting RPS standards, SMUD serves an additional 7.4% of its customer load with renewable energy through its voluntary SolarShares and Greenergy pricing programs described above. SMUD estimates that it has sufficient renewable energy deliveries, new power supply contract commitments, new power supply commitments under active discussion, and RPS-eligible surplus carryover to meet its RPS requirements through 2025. Additional resources have been identified that are expected to provide sufficient RPS-eligible resources to cover most of SMUD’s RPS requirements through 2030. Future solicitations may be needed to fill any remaining gaps. The following chart illustrates SMUD’s current RPS requirements through 2030 and its existing and committed resources utilized to meet those requirements.

In addition to procuring new sources, meeting the RPS requirements will require replacement of certain existing renewable contracts which expire in future years. While SMUD anticipates it will meet much of its renewable resource requirements through purchased contracts with third parties, it continues to explore additional options, including wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal developments, partnering with other utilities on future projects, and local development options. SMUD’s resource forecast (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources”) accounts for future renewable resources as a component of “Uncommitted Purchases.” To meet SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan goals, SMUD anticipates meeting loads in 2030 with approximately 70-80% renewable resources, in addition to hydro and other new zero carbon technologies. See “← 2030 Zero Carbon Plan” above.

Given the intermittent nature of power from renewable resources such as wind and solar, SMUD is exploring and investing in options that provide the flexibility to manage the intermittency of such renewable resources. Potential options include energy storage resources, which SMUD has committed to as part of the Zero Carbon Plan, and expanding load management resources. Additionally, on April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its membership in BANC, a joint exercise of powers agency formed in 2009, and currently comprised of SMUD, the Modesto Irrigation District (“MID”), the City of Roseville (“Roseville”), the City of Redding (“Redding”), the City of Shasta Lake and the Trinity Public Utilities District, commenced participation in the California Independent System Operator Corporation (“CAISO”) western energy imbalance market (“WEIM”). Participation in the WEIM benefits SMUD by providing it with broader access to balancing resources within the region to help manage its expanding renewable portfolio. In addition, other entities within the BANC Balancing Authority Area began participation in the WEIM on March 25, 2021. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Operational Independence and Local Control” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

In 2022, SMUD’s Board formally adopted the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan as SMUD’s updated IRP. SMUD filed the approved IRP update with the CEC on September 14, 2022, pursuant to the CEC’s guidelines, which called for updating SMUD’s IRP filing within five years of SMUD’s previous filing of April 29, 2019. SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan built upon the April 2019 IRP and set a goal for zero carbon emissions by 2030. SMUD’s next formal IRP process is expected to be completed and filed with the CEC in 2027. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

The State’s carbon cap-and-trade market established pursuant to Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”) began in 2013. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Greenhouse Gas Emissions” for a discussion of AB 32 and the State’s cap-and-trade program. SMUD anticipates that allowances allocated to SMUD will nearly equal SMUD’s compliance obligations under normal water year conditions. Under low water year conditions, SMUD may need to purchase additional allowances to cover its compliance obligations, including carbon obligations related to wholesale energy sales from SMUD’s natural gas power plants. As SMUD implements its clean power goals, SMUD expects its need for these allowances to decline.

There is scientific consensus that increasing concentrations of GHG have caused and will continue to cause a rise in temperatures in the State and around the world. The change in the earth’s average atmospheric temperature, generally referred to as “climate change,” is, among other things, expected to result in a wide range of changes in climate patterns, including increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including droughts and heat waves, more frequent incidences of wildfires, changes in wind patterns, sea level rise and flooding, any of which alone or in combination could materially adversely affect SMUD’s financial results or operations. See also “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION” and “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY – Other Factors.” As described above, SMUD is actively working to meet its sustainable power supply goals.

reduce its own GHG emissions, and assist the local governments in the territory it serves with their desired GHG reductions. In 2016, SMUD introduced the Pilot Natural Refrigerant Incentive Program, its first customer program providing incentives for GHG reduction in addition to kWh savings. SMUD is a founding member and active participant in the Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative, a public-private partnership formed to better understand and plan for climate impacts expected in the region. SMUD is also an active member of the United States Department of Energy (the “DOE”) Partnership for Energy Sector Climate Resilience. SMUD regularly reviews scientific findings related to climate change and in 2016 published its Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan. In 2024, SMUD is planning to update the Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan along with other climate resiliency actions.

**Energy Storage Systems.** Assembly Bill 2514 (“AB 2514”) requires the Board to re-evaluate energy storage goals every three years. In compliance with AB 2514, the Board established a target of 9 MW of energy storage procurement by December 31, 2020, which SMUD has procured. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Energy Storage Systems” for further discussion of AB 2514. In September 2020, the Board directed that energy storage forecasts be implemented through SMUD’s IRP process going forward. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” above for a discussion of SMUD’s IRP. SMUD is also evaluating how to couple utility-scale solar with utility-scale storage to support future system reliability needs and enable energy goals.

**Meeting Peak Load.** A significant consideration for SMUD will be how it addresses its system peak load. SMUD has implemented programs and tools, such as advanced metering, energy efficiency options, and TOD rates for residential customers, to help customers manage their costs while helping SMUD reduce its peak load. Analysis of 2022 data showed a reduction of approximately 108 MW, weather continue to monitor the progress and results of the implementation of TOD rates and will use this information to inform future rate actions and load forecasts. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Time-of-Day Rates.”

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved an optional residential Critical Peak Pricing rate (the “Peak Pricing Rate”), which went into effect June 1, 2022. The Peak Pricing Rate is designed to reduce load by increasing the price of energy when the grid is most impacted, up to 50 hours per summer. In exchange, customers on the rate will receive a per kWh discount on summer Off-Peak and Mid-Peak rates. SMUD is also exploring the use of more distributed energy resources and demand response programs that could further reduce SMUD’s system peak.

**Operational Independence and Local Control.** A key component of SMUD’s business strategy is focused on maintaining its independence in operating and maintaining its resources. As such, SMUD has taken a number of actions to mitigate the potential impacts of various federal and state regulatory actions. For example, in 2002 SMUD established itself as an independent control area (now termed “Balancing Authority”) within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (“WECC”) region. By removing itself from CAISO’s Balancing Authority area, SMUD became responsible for balancing electric supply and demand within its own service territory. This move substantially reduced fees paid to CAISO, preserved operational flexibility and helped to insulate SMUD from the uncertain regulatory environment and tariff structure of CAISO. In addition to decreased financial risks, this independence also reduced SMUD’s exposure to the impacts of capacity and energy shortages in the CAISO Balancing Authority area. Further, as an independent Balancing Authority, SMUD continued to support the statewide electric grid in events of electrical emergencies requiring rotating outages, such as loss of major transmission lines or equipment, as provided in the statewide emergency plan. By 2006, the SMUD Balancing Authority footprint expanded north to the California-Oregon border and south to Modesto, to include the service areas of the WAPA, MID, Redding and Roseville, and TANC-owned 340-mile 500-kV California-Oregon Transmission Project.

(“COTP”). In October 2009, SMUD, with the coordination and cooperation of WAPA, joined the Western Power Pool Reserve Sharing Group, which supports reliability and reduces operating costs. In May 2011, BANC assumed the role of the Balancing Authority, though SMUD continues to oversee operation of the grid on behalf of BANC. BANC members share cost responsibility for balancing authority-related compliance obligations, liabilities, and operations. BANC also serves as an important venue for SMUD and other BANC members to collaborate with respect to operational and market improvements inside the BANC footprint and to preserve their operational independence. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.” On April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its participation in BANC, began operating in the CAISO WEIM, which helps SMUD better manage the integration of renewable energy resources. The CAISO WEIM is a voluntary market, which allows SMUD to maintain its operational independence from the CAISO, while providing SMUD greater access to balancing resources throughout the western region. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

Electricity, Natural Gas, and Related Hedging

SMUD continues to utilize a comprehensive and integrated power and fuel supply strategy to acquire a reliable and diversified portfolio of resources to meet existing and future needs. This strategy includes a combination of both physical supply and financial hedging transactions to reduce price risk exposure over a five-year horizon. SMUD’s physical supply arrangements include ownership of power generating resources, as well as a diversified portfolio of power and fuel supply purchase contracts that range in duration, with a mixture of fixed and variable pricing terms.

With regard to the power purchase contracts, SMUD has entered into a series of contracts for the purchase of electricity to meet its resource needs. SMUD also actively manages its exposure on variable rate electricity purchases, and at times may enter into financial contracts to fix prices by using options to reduce price risk, in each case when warranted by economic conditions. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements.”

With regard to fuel supply contracts, SMUD utilizes a similar strategy of employing financial contracts of various durations to hedge its variable rate fuel supply contracts. As of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply – Supply.”

As provided in SMUD’s natural gas contracts, SMUD may be required to post collateral to various counterparties. As of February 29, 2024, SMUD did not have any collateral posting obligations. A decrease in natural gas prices could result in a collateral posting by SMUD. While the posting of collateral is not an expense for SMUD, it does temporarily encumber unrestricted cash balances.

To hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a pass-through rate component called the Hydro Generation Adjustment (the “IGA”), and established a Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund (the “HRSF”). Similarly, to hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a HGA and established a WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund (“WRSF”). These rate stabilization funds and rate pass through mechanisms help to offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs in years where precipitation levels at SMUD-owned and non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities are low. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

![Managing Risks](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Managing+Risks)

**Managing Risks**  
SMUD maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program, a strategic approach to managing enterprise-wide risks as a portfolio, to help reduce the chance of loss, create greater financial stability and protect SMUD resources. It is designed to maintain an early warning system to monitor changes in, and the emergence of, risks that affect the organization’s business objectives. Under the purview of the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee, composed of executive members and chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, ERM conducts ongoing risk identification, assessments, monitoring, mitigation, risk-based budgeting and reporting. To ensure accountability and oversight, each identified risk is assigned to an executive-level risk owner. Risk status and mitigation efforts are reported monthly to the Board.

**Competitive Challenges**  
In the coming decade, utilities like SMUD may face competition from companies in other industries looking to diversify into the energy sector. Examples of developing competitive areas include retail sale of electricity, distributed electric storage resources, renewable distributed generation (mostly solar in Sacramento), customer installation of fuel cells, third-party electric vehicle charging, home or business automation that enables greater customer participation in energy markets, and third-party provision of energy management software and solutions.

SMUD has a wide range of initiatives to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions and new industry participants. Key areas of focus include:

- **Enhancing customer experience.** Recognizing the importance of meeting customer expectations, SMUD introduced the Customer Experience Strategy in 2016 to provide customers “value for what they pay” and further strengthen customer loyalty. The initiative is focused on ensuring SMUD has the people, systems, technology, programs and services to consistently meet or exceed customers’ changing expectations. The customer experience is measured via surveys with the goal of achieving 80% of customers agreeing that SMUD provides them with value for what they pay by 2030.

- **Restructuring electric rates.** In 2017, the Board approved TOD rates as the standard rate for residential customers. The residential rate transition began in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the full transition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. All of SMUD’s business customers are also on time-based rates. In 2019, the Board approved a restructuring of commercial rates to collect a greater portion of fixed costs through fixed charges and to better align time periods and prices with energy markets. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” and “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

- **Ongoing integrated resource planning.** SMUD monitors and updates its integrated resource planning to ensure future sources of energy balance cost, reliability and environmental requirements with the flexibility to meet challenges of changing market and regulatory conditions, customer energy resources, and emerging technologies.

**Leveraging Core Competencies**  
In addition to these initiatives, SMUD is leveraging core competencies to improve industry safety and help communities serve their customers’ energy needs.

![Sacramento Power Academy](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Sacramento Power Academy.** The Sacramento Power Academy is SMUD’s operational training center providing training support for all of SMUD’s skilled trades professionals. Operating on a 10-acre training facility the academy oversees SMUD’s 14 skilled trades apprenticeships. The academy’s experienced training professionals serve as liaisons and mentors to apprentices progressing through on-the-job training, program testing, night schooling, and extensive training components. The academy also ensures SMUD’s skilled trades professionals are safe and compliant by coordinating and delivering annual regulatory and safety training. The academy is also a workforce development hub utilized by SMUD to increase awareness of and interest in skilled trades careers at SMUD, in SMUD’s community, and in the utility industry.

**Community Energy Services.** In 2002, Assembly Bill 117 was passed to establish Community Choice Aggregation in the State by authorizing Community Choice Aggregators (“CCAs”) to aggregate customer electric load and purchase electricity for customers. SMUD’s Community Energy Services department was established in 2017 to support organizations with values closely aligned with SMUD’s values, while also generating additional revenue for SMUD. CCA programs are proliferating in the State thanks to support for expanding renewable energy use and desire for local control particularly for electricity procurement. There are numerous CCAs operating in the State, and more are anticipated to launch in the future. CCAs are responsible for procuring wholesale power, setting the generation rate, and staffing a call center to handle opt-outs and questions about the power portfolio. The local investor-owned utility (“IOU”) continues to deliver electricity from the electric grid, maintain its electric infrastructure, bill customers and collect payments.

In October 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Valley Clean Energy (“VCE”) to provide technical, energy and support services, including data management and call center services, wholesale energy services, and business operations support, to VCE for a term set to end in 2023. SMUD and VCE recently executed a new contract for data management, contact center, consulting and debt collection services that expires on December 31, 2028. VCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the City of Woodland, the City of Davis and Yolo County to implement a local CCA program. The service territory expanded to include the City of Winters in 2021. The mission of VCE is to deliver cost-competitive clean electricity, product choice, price stability, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions to its customers in Yolo County. VCE began electric services to its customers in the summer of 2018, giving Yolo County residents a choice between two electricity providers, VCE and PG&E.

In November 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of East Bay Community Energy (“EBCE”) to provide call center and data management services for a three-year term beginning in January 2018. SMUD signed a new contract with EBCE in January 2022 for call center and data management services for an additional three-year term. EBCE recently changed its name to Ava Community Energy (“Ava”). Ava is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro and Union City in Alameda County to implement a local CCA program. Ava expanded its territory to the cities of Pleasanton, Newark, and Tracy in April 2021.

In June 2019, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Silicon Valley Clean Energy (“SVCE”) to provide program services to help local SVCE communities reduce carbon pollution while delivering engaging customer experiences. SVCE programs are focused on grid integration, as well as electrifying transportation, buildings and homes. This contract was extended through September of 2024. In June 2023, SMUD was selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s concierge service vendor for three years. In December 2023, SMUD was again selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s programs administrator for five years. SVCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Campbell, Cupertino, Gilroy, Lost Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill,

Mountain View, Saratoga, Sunnyvale and Unincorporated Santa Clara County to implement a local CCA program.

In July 2022, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Marin Clean Energy (“MCE”) to provide data management, billing, data analytic and system assessment services to MCE. MCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2010 and represents 37 member communities across four Bay Area counties: Contra Costa, Marin, Napa and Solano.

In September 2022, SMUD was selected through a competitive process by the governing board of Sonoma Clean Power (“SCP”) to provide market research services to SCP. In January of 2023, SMUD was selected to provide strategic consulting services, providing recommendations related to programs and marketing. SCP is a joint powers agency that serves Sonoma and Mendocino counties.

While CCAs have had success in the State, they are susceptible to business, regulatory and other risks that could lead to a financial loss and/or result in a cessation of operations for the CCA. These risks could extend to a CCA’s counterparties, including SMUD. SMUD has made an effort to identify and mitigate potential counterparty risks to the extent possible in service agreements with the CCAs described above. SMUD may pursue opportunities to provide similar services to additional CCAs in the future. SMUD management does not expect its current arrangements to have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

## FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION

### Precipitation Variability

SMUD uses a precipitation measuring station located at Fresh Pond, California to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s Upper American River Project (the “UARP”) hydropower reservoir. As of January 31, 2024, precipitation at Fresh Pond, California totaled 21 inches for the October-September hydropower water supply period. This is 75% of the 50-year rolling median of 28 inches. Total reservoir storage in the UARP hydropower reservoirs was 238 thousand acre-feet as of January 31, 2024, which was about 63% of capacity and approximately 6% above the historical average. SMUD manages its reservoirs to maximize water storage going into the summer season, which preserves generating capacity during SMUD’s high load months and ensures that SMUD meets its UARP FERC license requirements, including requirements for recreational and environmental flows.

There can be wide swings in precipitation from year to year. In years with below average rainfall, SMUD may have to generate or purchase replacement energy at additional cost. To hedge against variations in the volume of energy received from SMUD-owned UARP hydroelectric resources, SMUD uses the HRSF to help offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

SMUD is also exposed to precipitation variability through its contract with the WAPA. In an average water year this contract provides roughly 661 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of power. WAPA’s actual deliveries are based on hydroelectric generation (minus energy used for pumping) at Central Valley Project reservoirs in Northern California, which varies based on annual precipitation patterns, water deliveries for agriculture, and flow requirements in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Unlike the UARP, SMUD does not monitor precipitation stations to approximate power deliveries under the WAPA contract, and instead relies on a forecast of power deliveries from WAPA. As of January 31, 2024, WAPA has forecasted power deliveries of 703 GWh for 2024, approximately 6% more than an average water year. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration.”

# Wildfires

## General
Wildfires in the State have become increasingly common and destructive. Frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased, and could further increase, the possibility of wildfires occurring in areas where SMUD maintains generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The number of diseased and dead trees has increased, and could further increase this possibility. As a result, SMUD faces an increased risk that it may be required to pay for wildfire related property damage or
<!-- Page 650 -->
![Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory)](https://example.com/image.png)

**Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory).** In 2018, the CPUC approved a new statewide fire map that identifies areas of elevated and extreme wildfire risk from utility-associated assets located throughout the State. SMUD directly participated in the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map. In connection with the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map, a peer review and a team of independent nationwide experts led by Cal Fire affirmed that SMUD’s electric service area is properly located outside of these elevated (“Tier 2”) and extreme (“Tier 3”) high fire threat areas; however, SMUD’s UARP facilities are located within both Tier 2 and Tier 3 areas. According to the CPUC, Tier 2 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an elevated wildfire risk from utility assets and Tier 3 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an extreme risk from utility assets. As of June 8, 2021, approximately 37 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 19 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. SMUD is also a member of TANC. As of July 2022, approximately 116.3 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 4.5 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. In accordance with its FERC license, SMUD adheres to a FERC-approved Fire Prevention and Response Plan for its UARP facilities. On May 17, 2018, in accordance with State law, SMUD’s Board of Directors determined that the UARP area may have a “significant risk of catastrophic wildfire” resulting from overhead electric facilities and that SMUD’s FERC-approved UARP Fire Prevention and Response Plan meets requirements for presenting wildfire mitigation measures to the Board for its approval.

**Wildfire Mitigation.** In response to potential wildfire risk, SMUD has implemented and is continuing to implement a series of measures intended to prevent wildfires from occurring, minimize the spread of any fire that does occur and improve the resiliency of its system. These measures include an increase in the number of inspections of fuel reduction inside and adjacent to rights-of-ways, utilization of Cal Fire-approved vegetation management to reduce the risk of spark generation; enhanced inspection and maintenance programs; increased use of ignition reduction techniques, including undergrounding of conductors; increased monitoring of identified responses to fire conditions, including operational procedures for the de-energization of lines during high fire conditions; and elimination of automatic reclosing on SMUD’s transmission lines and on SMUD’s distribution lines in certain areas during fire season.

SMUD’s proactive approach to vegetation management has been expanded to include the use of advanced technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (“LiDAR”), ortho and oblique imagery that is used to pinpoint tree health and/or condition that may not yet be visible to the naked eye. In addition, SMUD has installed additional weather stations in transmission corridors and substations for increased situational awareness and has continued coordination and collaboration with local agencies and first responders as well as vulnerable populations.

State legislation enacted in 2018 and 2019 (SB 901 and AB 1054, respectively) requires publicly owned utilities (“POUs”) to prepare and present Wildfire Mitigation Plans to their governing boards by January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter. SB 901 requires POUs, including SMUD, before January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, to prepare a wildfire mitigation plan and present it in a public meeting to their governing board. SB 901 requires POU’s to accept comments on the wildfire mitigation plan from the public, other local and State agencies, and interested parties, and to verify that the plan complies with all applicable rules, regulations, and standards, as appropriate. The bill requires a qualified independent evaluator to review and assess the comprehensiveness of its wildfire mitigation plan and present its report to the board in a public meeting. AB 1054 created a new Wildfire Safety Division within the CPUC to prioritize wildfire safety throughout the State, and established an appointed Wildfire Safety Advisory Board (“WSAB”) to advise and make recommendations relating to wildfire safety to this new Division. For POUs, the bill requires submittal of annual wildfire mitigation plans to the WSAB for review and advisory opinions relating to the content and sufficiency of the plans.

A-18
<!-- Page 651 -->
SMUD assembled an enterprise-wide team of subject-matter experts to prepare its plan in compliance with this legislation. SMUD’s initial Wildfire Mitigation Plan (“WMP”) was adopted by the Board in the fourth quarter of 2019, after circulation for public comment and review of the comprehensiveness of the plan by a qualified independent evaluator. The WMP and evaluator’s report were submitted to the WSAB in 2020.

SMUD reviews its WMP each year, presenting the updated plan to the Board for adoption at duly noticed public meetings. The updated plans and evaluator reports are submitted to the WSAB for advisory opinion and recommendations. SMUD responds to the WSAB’s comments regarding SMUD’s WMP as part of its WMP process. SMUD will continue to annually review and update its WMP, conducting a comprehensive review at least every third year.

SMUD recently completed a comprehensive review and update of its WMP after soliciting public input and independent evaluation. The 2023-2025 WMP was adopted by the Board on June 15, 2023, and duly submitted to the WSAB.

**Wildfire Insurance.** Wildfires both in California and nationally have not only increased potential liability for utilities, but have also adversely impacted the insurance markets, leading to higher costs for coverage; coverages becoming prohibitively expensive; limited or restricted coverage to certain types of risks; or coverage at insufficient levels. SMUD most recently renewed its general and wildfire liability insurance coverage on June 15, 2023, increasing the coverage limit by $25 million to $275 million. SMUD increased the commercially insured portion of its wildfire coverage program from $176 million to $212.5 million and maintained the self-insured layers and quota share portions of the coverage at $6.5 million.

In addition, it is expected that SMUD will have a portion of the $500 million aggregate limit amount of its commercial paper and line of credit program to provide operational flexibility in the event of the occurrence of a wildfire or other operational event. However, SMUD has not covenanted to maintain the availability of the commercial paper program and line of credit program for these purposes and no assurances can be given that the commercial paper and line of credit program will be available at the time of, or during, such an event.

**August 2020 Heat Wave**

The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from August 14, 2020 through August 18, 2020. The CAISO was forced to institute rotating electricity outages in the State during this extreme heat wave. SMUD, as a member of BANC, and being outside of the CAISO did not have to implement any planned power disruptions. Additionally, SMUD was able to support the CAISO during some hours of the heat wave with both requested emergency assistance and wholesale market sales. SMUD’s peak demand between August 14, 2020 and August 18, 2020, varied between 2,874 MW and 3,057 MW, well below SMUD’s record peak of 3,299 MW.

**September 2022 Heat Wave**

The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from September 5, 2022 through September 8, 2022. On September 6, 2022, SMUD experienced its second highest peak demand of 3,263 MW. SMUD did not have to implement any planned power disruptions.

**Storm Damage**

In January 2023, SMUD experienced a series of winter storms that brought heavy rains and high winds causing damage to SMUD’s grid and widespread outages for SMUD’s customers. By the time the  
A-19

**storm response was complete, SMUD had experienced the largest mobilization of personnel and restoration crews in its history. SMUD incurred costs related to removing downed trees, restoring power from downed poles and broken lines, replenishing inventory, communicating with and providing assistance to customers, maintaining IT systems, and coordinating with local emergency agencies. SMUD is pursuing claims with Federal and State agencies to attempt to recover certain of SMUD’s costs related to the storms. The material financial impacts have been reflected in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, [which are included in APPENDIX B].**

**Cosumnes Power Plant Outage**

On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant (as defined herein) was shut down due to a ground fault in the Steam Turbine Generator (“STG”) stator. The ground fault was caused by delamination of the insulation on one of the through bolts. Damage from the ground fault resulted in a full rewind and restack of the stator core, replacement of all stator through bolts, and a full rewind of turbine rotor. The Cosumnes Power Plant repairs were completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. During the extended outage, SMUD shifted generation to the other local gas-fired plants and the Sutter Energy Center and procured additional energy and resource adequacy capacity. SMUD also requested and received approval from the California Air Quality Board and California Energy Commission to operate one or both of the gas turbines without the STG. During the September 2022 heatwave, both of the gas turbines at the Cosumnes Power Plant were operated without the STG, providing 270 MW at peak.

To mitigate the financial impact of unplanned outages from its thermal assets, SMUD carries commercial property insurance with a business interruption endorsement. At the time of the loss, the coverage provided up to $30.8 million of business interruption recovery per month at the Cosumnes Power Plant, with a sub-limit of $310 million over any 18-month period. During the period of loss, claims were subject to a $5 million equipment damage deductible and a 60-day business interruption claims waiting period.

SMUD has settled the equipment damage portion of the loss for $18.6 million, resulting in a $13.6 million recovery. The business interruption portion of the claim remains in process, with SMUD receiving a $50 million advance in December of 2022. As of January 2024, the carriers have confirmed an additional $51 million in undisputed recovery, which is anticipated to be received in the first quarter of 2024. Thus far, SMUD has recovered $114.6 million of the loss and will continue to work toward full settlement of the disputed portion of the claim, which is approximately $68 million.

**Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic**

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD has lessened since the height of the pandemic in 2020, SMUD is still experiencing impacts from the pandemic. However, compared to weather adjusted load levels, SMUD’s overall load is near or above pre-pandemic levels.

Part of the governmental response to the economic consequences of the pandemic required utility providers (including SMUD) to provide additional grace periods and flexible payment plans for the payment of utility bills or to refrain from pursuing collection remedies for unpaid bills for a period of time. SMUD also implemented a no-shutoff policy through January 2022 under which SMUD did not disconnect power to a customer for non-payment of their electric bill. Beginning in February 2022, SMUD resumed its normal payment, late fee, and disconnection process and began disconnections of unpaid accounts in late April 2022. As a result, SMUD has experienced an increase in delinquencies for customer electric accounts versus pre-pandemic levels. In December 2021, SMUD received $41 million from the California Arrearage Payment Program (“CAPP”) initial funding, and an additional $9.9 million in 2022. All funds were applied to delinquent balances. As of December 31, 2023, the total delinquencies for customer electric

**A-20**
<!-- Page 653 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

accounts were $38.2 million, after the CAPP credit, which is an increase from the February 2020 balance of total delinquencies for customer electric accounts of $16.9 million. The financial impacts stemming from delinquent accounts have been accounted for in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the preceding years. Any successful recovery of delinquent accounts will contribute to an increase in net income.

SMUD also paused the recertification process for existing customers in SMUD’s low-income discount program during the pandemic. The number of customers participating in the low-income assistance program increased by 16,407, or approximately 22% from February 2020 to December 2023. SMUD has resumed the recertification process for existing customers in the low-income discount program in 2023.

While the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD have lessened, if the pandemic and its consequences again become more severe or another similar event occurs, the impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations could be material.

## RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE

### Rates and Charges

SMUD’s Board of Directors has autonomous authority to establish the rates charged for all SMUD services. Unlike IOUs and some other municipal utility systems, retail rate and revenue levels are not subject to review or regulation by any other federal, State or local governmental agencies. Changes to SMUD rates only require formal action by the Board of Directors after two public workshops and a public hearing. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government. SMUD typically reviews and sets rates on a two-year cycle.

### 2019 Rate Action

On June 24, 2019, the Board approved a 3.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2020, a 3.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2020, a 2.50% rate increase effective January 1, 2021, and a 2.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2021, for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved a restructuring of the commercial rates, including new time periods and an overall increase in the fixed bill components, such as the System Infrastructure Fixed Charge and demand charges, and a corresponding decrease in energy charges, making the restructuring revenue neutral by rate category. To minimize bill impacts, rate categories will be restructured over an eight-year period.

### 2021 Rate Action

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved a 1.5% rate increase effective March 1, 2022 and a 2.0% rate increase effective January 1, 2023 for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved the Solar and Storage Rate, the optional residential Peak Pricing Rate, and updates to certain schedules of SMUD’s Open Access Transmission Tariff (“OATT”). The Board also approved a new timeline for the commercial rate restructure transition, and all impacted commercial customers were transitioned to the new rates by the end of the first quarter of 2022.

SMUD also implemented a solar interconnection fee based on the size of solar interconnection and supporting programs such as battery incentives, incentives to enroll in SMUD’s Peak Pricing Rate, battery incentives for Virtual Power Plants, and a program to bring the benefits of solar to under-resourced multi-family communities. These programs and fees are not subject to Board approval.
<!-- Page 654 -->
![2023 Rate Action](https://example.com/image.png)

**2023 Rate Action**

On September 21, 2023, the Board approved a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2025, and a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2025 for all customer classes. The Board also approved establishing the Energy Assistance Program Rate (“EAPR”) Rate Stabilization Fund, which will provide an additional discount to those low-income customers with the greatest need. The discount will be funded with discretionary, non-retail rate revenue, as to not have an impact on any future required rate changes. There is currently pending litigation concerning the adoption of the 2023 rates. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”

**Rate Stabilization Funds**

The Rate Stabilization Fund (“RSF”) is maintained by SMUD to reduce the need for future rate increases when costs exceed existing rates. At the direction of the Board, amounts may be either transferred into the RSF (which reduces revenues) or transferred out of the RSF (which increases revenues). The Board authorizes RSF transfers on an event driven basis. The RSF includes funds to hedge variations in the volume of energy received from WAPA hydroelectric generation, variation in AB 32 revenue and variations in Low Carbon Fuel Credit (“LCFS”) revenue. As of December 31, 2023, the balance in the RSF was $115.8 million, which is approximately 7.2% of annual retail revenue.

Effective July 2008, SMUD implemented the HGA, which is a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from the UARP (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric”). The HGA is designed to increase the deposits to the HRSF in wet years when SMUD has more hydroelectric generation than expected. Each year SMUD determines the impact of precipitation variances on projected hydroelectric generation from the UARP. When the precipitation variance results in a deficiency of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, transfers from the HRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is zero. When the precipitation variance results in a projected surplus of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, deposits will be made into the HRSF in an amount approximating the positive impact to SMUD from the surplus hydroelectric generation (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is not sufficient to cover transfers that would otherwise be made in the event of a projected deficiency in UARP hydroelectric generation, a 12-month HGA surcharge will automatically be included on customers’ electric bills at a level that generates up to 4% of retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue on any precipitation variance calculation date and the precipitation variance results in a projected UARP hydroelectric generation surplus, the positive impact of the surplus may be used for other purposes at staff’s recommendation, with the approval of the Board, including returned to customers through an electric bill discount up to 4% of retail revenue. SMUD calculates HRSF transfers based on an April-March (water year) precipitation period at Fresh Pond, California. This precipitation station is used to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s UARP hydropower reservoirs. As of January 31, 2024, and based on the current HRSF water year precipitation forecast, SMUD anticipates transferring $20.8 million out of the HRSF in April 2024.

In September 2023, SMUD added a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from WAPA. Each year SMUD determines the WAPA Energy Delivery Variance (“EDV”) based on forecasted energy delivery minus the actual energy delivery. When the EDV variance is positive, transfers from the WRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 2% of cash).

**Low Income Discount**

As of December 2023, approximately 91,407 customers received the low-income discount offered by SMUD, which represents approximately 16% of all residential customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, SMUD suspended recertification during the pandemic. In 2023, the total discount was approximately $32.7 million. As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn, SMUD experienced an increase in low-income discount applicants. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

While the low-income discount has provided substantial benefits to low-income customer bills for years, multiple economic variables, such as inflation and rate increases, have had disproportionately negative impacts on low-income customers, particularly those in the 0-50% Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”). In 2023, SMUD established an EAPR Rate Stabilization Fund (“ERSF”) to provide an additional discount to the electricity usage charge up to an established maximum discount (“ERSF Additional Discount”) for customers in the 0-50% FPL. The ERSF is funded by discretionary non-retail rate revenue, reviewed on an annual basis, and the specific monthly ERSF Additional Discount is set before the year the value is in effect. SMUD expanded its programs and services starting in 2016 to help customers with energy assistance, home improvement packages and education. SMUD is creating tailored solutions to best meet the needs of low-income customers. These solutions include free solar panels and inspecting homes to identify energy saving and fuel switching opportunities. As of December 2023, SMUD has performed 30,000 energy retrofits and, in partnership with Grid Alternatives (a non-profit organization that focuses on implementing solar power and energy efficiency for low-income families), 230 customers have benefited from free solar installations. Forty-eight additional homes received solar and energy efficiency through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento. As part of SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan and the focus on building electrification, SMUD has also been ramping up electrification investments for low-income customers. Additionally, since 2019, SMUD has assisted more than 2,600 households with electrification upgrades. Additionally, SMUD has installed nearly 450 electric vehicle chargers and more than 400 electric vehicle circuits in low-income households or areas that serve low-income customers.

# Customer Base: Largest Customers

A stabilizing influence on SMUD’s revenues is that a substantial proportion is derived from residential customers (49.2% in 2023). Historically, revenue from commercial and industrial consumption has been more sensitive to economic fluctuation. Furthermore, SMUD has no dominant customers that account for a significant percentage of annual revenues. In 2023, no single customer contributed more than 3% of revenues. The top ten customers generated approximately 9% of revenues and the top 30 generated approximately 15% of revenues. The following table presents information on SMUD’s top ten customers as of December 31, 2023.

# Power Generation Facilities

## Hydroelectric
The UARP consists of three relatively large storage reservoirs (Union Valley, Loon Lake and Ice House) with an aggregate water storage capacity of approximately 400,000 acre-feet and eight small reservoirs. Project facilities also include eight tunnels with a combined length of over 26 miles and eight powerhouses containing 11 turbines. In addition to providing clean hydroelectric power and operating flexibility for SMUD, the UARP area provides habitat for fish and wildlife and a variety of recreational opportunities, including camping, fishing, boating, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and cross-country skiing.

The combined capacity of the UARP is approximately 685 MW at SMUD’s load center in Sacramento. Under current licensing and mean water conditions, these facilities are expected to generate approximately 1,600 GWh of electric energy annually, which represents approximately 15% of SMUD’s current average annual retail energy requirements. In 1957, the Federal Power Commission (predecessor agency to FERC) issued a license to SMUD for the UARP. This 50-year license was subsequently amended to add and upgrade facilities and now includes all segments of SMUD’s hydroelectric facilities located on the South Fork of the American River and its tributaries upstream from the Chili Bar Project (described below). On July 23, 2014, FERC issued to SMUD a new 50-year license for the UARP.

On November 9, 2016 FERC issued an Order authorizing SMUD to construct the South Fork Powerhouse downstream of the UARP’s Slab Creek Dam. Construction was substantially completed in the fall of 2020, and the new powerhouse was placed into operation on October 25, 2022, adding 1.8 MW of generation to the UARP’s overall capacity.

On June 16, 2021, pursuant to Board authorization, SMUD approved the Chili Bar Hydroelectric Project which consists of a 7 MW powerhouse, reservoir, dam and spillway, north of Placerville on the South Fork of the American River for approximately $10.4 million (the “Chili Bar Project”). The Chili Bar Project is immediately downstream from the UARP and operates as the regulating reservoir for the UARP’s largest powerhouse. Owning the UARP and the Chili Bar Project enables SMUD to operate the two projects with a holistic approach to license compliance and generation efficiency.

## Solano 2 Wind Project
SMUD owns and operates an 87 MW wind project, located in Solano County, known as Solano 2. Solano 2 consists of 29 wind turbine generators (“WTGs”) rated at 3.0 MW. Energy from the project is collected at 21 kV and transmitted over a dedicated 3-mile overhead system to the SMUD-owned Russell substation. At the Russell facility, the energy is transformed to 230 kV and interconnected to PG&E’s Birds Landing Switching Station. Energy deliveries are scheduled through the CAISO.

## Solano 3 Project
In 2011 and 2012, SMUD constructed a 128 MW wind project adjacent to Solano Phase 2, known as Solano 3. The Solano 3 project consists of 31 WTGs rated at 1.8 MW and 24 WTGs rated at 3.0 MW. The project interconnects through a 34.5 kV underground collection system to the Russell substation. Like the Solano Phase 2 project, this energy is transformed to 230 kV and delivered through the CAISO.

## Solano 4 Project
SMUD has developed the Solano 4 Wind Project on land with a wind easement owned by SMUD near the Solano 3 project, known as the Collinsville and Roberts properties, to install 10 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW, and to remove the Solano 1 turbines and replace them with 9 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW. SMUD has met all of the CAISO requirements and has executed a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement (“GLIA”) as of June 2021 that will allow for 90.8 MW of capacity at the point of interconnection. In April 2021, SMUD submitted an application for advisory review by the Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (the “Solano ALUC”) of the Solano 4 Wind Project’s consistency.

with the 2015 Travis Air Force Base Land Use Compatibility Plan (the “Travis Plan”). In May 2021, the Solano ALUC purported to resolve that the Solano 4 Wind Project was inconsistent with the Travis Plan. In August 2021, the Board approved the Project Environmental Impact Report, made findings overriding the Solano ALUC’s finding of inconsistency, made findings there was no alternative to the project, and approved the Solano 4 Wind Project. In September 2021, Solano County filed a writ petition challenging SMUD’s approval of the Solano 4 Wind Project based on procedural, environmental, zoning and land use grounds. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 14, 2022, and the suit was dismissed on January 10, 2023. The settlement agreement allows for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project as planned.

In addition, SMUD applied for and obtained extensions of the Federal Aviation Administration Determinations of No Hazard allowing for construction of the turbines. A contract for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project was awarded to Vestas Corporation and the Solano 4 Wind Project is currently under construction. The expected operation date for the Solano 4 Wind Project is May 2024. PG&E identified upgrades needed to interconnect the Solano 4 Wind Project that will not be complete before the expected Solano 4 commercial operation date. PG&E has an approved project and expects to complete the needed upgrades by May of 2025. Realization of the full capacity of the Solano 4 Wind Project may be delayed into the second quarter of 2025 due to the timeframe established for the PG&E required transmission upgrades. SMUD has developed a mitigation plan for the limited interconnection capacity for the first year of operation, in coordination with CAISO and PG&E, of using all of the existing SMUD Solano Russell substation interconnection capacity combined for the dispatch of all the Solano Wind Project. SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process, which combines all phases of the Solano 4 Wind Project so it may operate as one project. This was fully executed by SMUD, CAISO, and PG&E on February 27, 2023.

As of the end of 2023, all of the turbine site delivery roads and foundations for the Solano 4 Project have been completed, all of the turbine components have been delivered to the Solano 4 Project site and 10 of the Solano 4 Project turbines have been fully erected.

At the completion of the Solano 4 project, SMUD will have an installed wind capacity of 303 MW in connection with the overall Solano Wind Project, leaving 18 MW at the point of interconnection for future development.

**Distributed Solar Photovoltaic.** SMUD owns and operates approximately 2 MW of solar photovoltaic generating facilities. These facilities include installations at the Hedge Substation property, SMUD Headquarters, the East Campus Operations Center, and other smaller photovoltaic systems throughout the service area on parking lots.

**Hedge Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 4 MW, 8 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached commercial operation in January 2023.

**ESS Flow Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 0.45 MW, 3 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached test operation in September 2023, and commercial operation is planned for March 2024.

**Local Gas-Fired Plants.** SMUD constructed five local natural gas-fired plants in its service area: the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, the Campbell Soup Project, McClellan and the Cosumnes Power Plant (each defined below). These five plants are referred to collectively as the “Local Gas-Fired Plants.” These plants are a strategic component of SMUD’s resource mix. In addition to providing SMUD a total capacity of approximately 1,139 MW, the Local Gas-Fired Plants provide SMUD with needed

**Local Gas-Fired Plants Overview**

SMUD has entered into long-term agreements with SFA providing for the purchase by SMUD of all of the power from each of the Local Gas-Fired Plants on a take-or-pay basis. This consolidation created operational and administrative efficiencies without changing any of the functionality of the power plants. Although the Local Gas-Fired Plants are owned by SFA, SMUD has exclusive control of their dispatch and manages their operations as part of its overall power supply strategy.

Payments under the power purchase agreements are payable from the revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of the principal of or interest on SMUD’s Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the caption “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below), as are other maintenance and operation costs and energy payments. For further discussion of SMUD’s obligations to make these payments to SFA, see “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Joint Powers Authorities.”

**Description of the Five Local Gas-Fired Plants:**

1. **The Cosumnes Power Plant (the “Cosumnes Power Plant”)**  
   The Cosumnes Power Plant is a 612 MW natural gas-fired, combined cycle plant located in the southern portion of Sacramento County adjacent to SMUD’s decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant. Commercial operation of the Cosumnes Power Plant commenced on February 24, 2006. SFA increased the net generating capacity of the facility by 81 MWs via an Advanced Gas Path (“AGP”) upgrade. The additional AGP generation was realized after hardware and software upgrades were completed. The Cosumnes Power Plant is owned by SFA, a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and MID. The existing take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA expires no earlier than when the related bonds have been paid in full (the outstanding related bonds are scheduled to mature on July 1, 2030). On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant was shut down due to a ground fault in the STG stator. The repair was completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Cosumnes Power Plant Outage”.

2. **The Carson Cogeneration Project (the “Carson Project”)**  
   The Carson Project, a 103 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project consisting of separate cycle and peaking plants, provides steam to the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) wastewater treatment plant adjacent to the site. The Carson Project was originally owned by the Central Valley Financing Authority (“CVFA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and the SRCSD. Construction of the Carson Project was completed and the plant began commercial operation on October 11, 1995. The CVFA bonds issued to finance the Carson Project were defeased in September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Carson Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

3. **The Procter & Gamble Cogeneration Project (the “Procter & Gamble Project”)**  
   The Procter & Gamble Project, a 182 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, is located in an established industrial area of Sacramento. The initial combined cycle portion of the plant began commercial operation on March 1, 1997. Construction of the peaking plant portion of the Procter & Gamble Project commenced during 2000 and the unit achieved commercial status on April 24, 2001. The Procter & Gamble Project produces steam for use in Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company’s oleochemical manufacturing processes and electricity for sale to SMUD. The Procter & Gamble Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Cogeneration Authority (“SCA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA, a separate joint powers authority. The SCA bonds issued to finance the Procter & Gamble Project were defeased in
<!-- Page 664 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Procter & Gamble Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Procter & Gamble Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

**The Campbell Soup Cogeneration Project (the “Campbell Soup Project”).** The Campbell Soup Project, a 170 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project, was completed and began commercial operations on December 4, 1997. Upgrades were implemented during 2000, which increased the plant’s peaking capacity to 180 MW, well above its net demonstrated capacity of 159.8 MW. The plant is located in south Sacramento adjacent to the Capital Commerce Center (formerly the Campbell Soup Company food processing facility). The Campbell Soup Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Power Authority (“SPA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA. The SPA bonds issued to finance the Campbell Soup Project were redeemed in July 2015. In late 2021, ownership of the Campbell Soup Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Campbell Soup Project (the “Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA”) covers both the Campbell Soup Project and McClellan and will be in effect until terminated by SMUD. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing the Campbell Soup Project in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**The McClellan Gas Turbine (“McClellan”).** McClellan is a 72 MW natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine generating plant at McClellan Business Park in Sacramento. This turbine is connected to SMUD’s electric system and is operated to meet SMUD’s peak-load requirements. McClellan is aligned for remote starting and operation with black start and fast start capabilities. SMUD constructed the McClellan unit in 1986 as a 50 MW emergency power source for the McClellan Air Force Base. In 2001, following the Air Force base closure, McClellan was repurposed for SMUD’s use. In May 2007, SMUD transferred ownership of McClellan to SPA for more efficient operation. SPA did not issue debt related to McClellan. In late 2021, ownership of McClellan was transferred to SFA. SFA pays all costs of operations and maintenance through to SMUD in accordance with the terms of the Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA. In exchange for paying all costs related to McClellan, SMUD receives all of the power generated thereby on a take-or-pay basis. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing McClellan in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**Fuel Supply**

**General.** SMUD is obligated to arrange for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Management of the natural gas procurement and delivery process is a key focus of SMUD’s reliability and risk policies. Although the natural gas consumption of the power plants for SMUD’s load can vary significantly depending on the season, precipitation, and the market price of power and natural gas, the plants are forecasted to need, on average in 2024, a total of approximately 91,000 Decatherms per day (“Dth/day”) with a daily peak slightly more than 171,000 Dth/day of natural gas. SMUD has implemented a comprehensive strategy to secure a reliable and diversified fuel supply through a variety of agreements for the supply, transportation, and storage of natural gas.

**Supply.** SMUD hedges a significant portion of its expected gas needs to meet customer power requirements. This includes gas for the Local Gas-Fired Plants and for the Sutter Energy Center. See “Power Purchase Agreements – Sutter Energy Center”. This is accomplished through a combination of long-term supply arrangements and an exposure reduction program. The program consists of a primarily rolling three-year exposure reduction component, a fuel hedging component on a rolling three-year basis, as well as supplemental fixed calendar year components reaching out up to five calendar years. Long-term

A-32
<!-- Page 665 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

arrangements may consist of a combination of physical commodity supply contracts, financial hedges, or options. Natural gas is purchased from a wide variety of producers and marketers at the northern and southern California borders, and from the San Juan and the Rocky Mountain supply basins. SMUD has a number of both fixed-price supply agreements and financial hedging contracts to fix gas costs ranging from one month to several years in duration. Including fixed price biogas contracts as of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted.

SMUD has contracted with NCGA to purchase an approximate average of 8,700 Dth/day over the remaining life of a contract expiring May 31, 2027 (the “NCGA Contract”). Under the NCGA contract, SMUD pays a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. Until November 1, 2023 the delivery point for the NCGA Contract was the AECO hub in Alberta. Starting November 1, 2023, to increase delivery efficiencies, SMUD has exchanged the gas delivered at the AECO hub under the NCGA Contract with gas delivered at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border. From there SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants.

SMUD has also contracted with NCEA to purchase an approximately 22,000 Dth/day on average, or to be converted to the appropriate cash flow value in Megawatt-hours (“MWh”) of electricity over the remaining life of a contract expiring on May 31, 2049. The gas will be delivered to the SMUD system via the Malin receipt point on the PG&E backbone system. SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants. SMUD will pay a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. In connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement), SMUD expects to amend and restate the contract with NCEA in connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement.) [adjust for 2024 Senior Bonds offering documents]

**Renewable Natural Gas Supply.** As a component of meeting SMUD’s RPS goals, SMUD procures renewable natural gas and digesters gas as fuels to generate renewable electricity from the Cosumnes Power Plant. Descriptions of the renewable natural gas supply agreements are provided below.

In March 2009, SMUD entered into a 15-year contract (that qualifies as renewable energy) with Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (“Shell Energy”) to purchase up to 6,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from a landfill project in Texas. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in April 2009. In March 2012, SMUD amended the contract with Shell Energy to increase the maximum volumes to 7,300 Dth/day and extended the term by 10 years to March 31, 2034. Currently, the delivery point is PG&E Topock and SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In 2016, SMUD entered into a 3-year contract with Shell Energy to sell back the entire volume of renewable natural gas purchased, less 500 Dth/day, to be sold into the vehicle transportation markets. Upon expiration of the initial 3-year contract for the sale of biogas to Shell Energy, SMUD extended the sell back of the entire volume of biogas twice for an additional three years with Element Markets (now RNG, LLC), starting in 2020 and 2023. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

SMUD contracted with Heartland Renewable Energy, LLC (“HRE”) in December 2009 for a 20-year supply of up to 7,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas from a digester facility in Colorado. Deliveries began in March of 2014. Currently, the delivery point is Opal, Wyoming and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. HRE has not delivered volumes from the project to SMUD since December 2016 due to litigation with Weld County, Colorado regarding odor and
<!-- Page 666 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

permit issues. EDF Renewables, the majority owner of HRE, notified SMUD in August of 2017 that it is in discussions with a short list of bidders to sell its interests in the facility. In June of 2020, the project was purchased and SMUD’s contract was assigned to the new owner, Platte River Biogas, LLC (“PRB”). SMUD and PRB reached a settlement in the third quarter of 2021 that could lead to terminating the contract.

In September 2011, SMUD and CVFA entered into a “Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement” through which the Carson Project cleans nearly all of the digester gas received from Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) and sells it to SMUD for delivery to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In return, SMUD pays all of the Carson Project’s costs in acquiring, cleaning and making the gas available to SMUD. The Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, along with the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The Carson Project is currently receiving, processing and selling up to 1,500 Dth/day with provisions for volume increases over time to 2,500 Dth/day. Digester gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations.

In December 2011, SMUD entered into a 20-year agreement with EIF KC Landfill Gas LLC (“EIF”) to purchase up to 7,050 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from multiple landfill projects. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in January 2014. Currently the delivery point is Kern River – Opal and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. Renewable natural gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations. In April 2022, SMUD entered into a transaction to sell the renewable natural gas purchased into the renewable natural gas markets. The transaction expires in March 2025. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

AB 2196 is a law that defines the criteria by which existing and future renewable natural gas contracts will qualify for the State RPS program. The CEC adopted a RPS Eligibility Guidebook on April 30, 2013, which includes detailed rules for implementation of AB 2196. SMUD received an updated certificate of eligibility from the CEC in July 2014 for the Cosumnes Power Plant that included the quantities of renewable natural gas from all contracts. The CEC adopted a revised RPS Eligibility Guidebook (Ninth Edition) on April 27, 2017. This latest guidebook did not change the RPS eligibility of any of the above SMUD renewable natural gas and digester gas contracts, but did simplify reporting requirements for these contracts.

Gas Transmission

SMUD has satisfied its obligation to deliver natural gas to its power plants by constructing a natural gas pipeline, purchasing an equity interest in two PG&E backbone gas transmission lines, and contracting for capacity on a number of existing interstate natural gas transmission lines.

The Local Pipeline. SMUD constructed and owns a 20-inch, 50-mile natural gas pipeline in the greater Sacramento area (the “Local Pipeline”) that transports gas to all of the Local Gas-Fired Plants except McClellan. The Local Pipeline is interconnected with PG&E’s major State gas transmission lines 300 and 401. Additionally, it may be interconnected with one or more private gas gathering pipelines located in the area, a gas storage project and/or other FERC approved pipelines that may be built in the local area. In conjunction with the construction of the Cosumnes Power Plant, SMUD extended the Local Pipeline to the plant site. The 26-mile extension was completed in 2004. The extension is 24 inches in diameter and was designed to serve both the Cosumnes Power Plant and an additional second phase, if constructed.

![PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401](https://example.com/image.png)

**PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401.** In 1996, SMUD purchased an equity interest in PG&E’s backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 (referred to as the PG&E backbone). The total capacity acquired at that time was approximately 85,000 Dth/day and consisted of approximately 43,600 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, Oregon and 44,700 Dth/day from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California. SMUD was also entitled to a share of non-firm capacity, which was approximately 4,360 Dth/day; making the total capacity potentially available to SMUD almost 90,000 Dth/day. This purchase made SMUD a co-owner of the PG&E backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 and obligated SMUD to pay PG&E to operate the pipelines on its behalf subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and operating protocols. PG&E reduced operating pressures on Line 300 after PG&E suffered a natural gas explosion in San Bruno, CA in September of 2010. Operating pressures and capacity may also fluctuate due to regulatory and other changes. As of December 1, 2021, SMUD holds a total capacity of approximately 87,000 Dth/day, consisting of approximately 47,572 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, and 39,193 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California.

**Kern River Gas Transmission Company Long Term Agreement.** SMUD has an agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company for 200,000 Dth/day of firm capacity through April 30, 2028. This capacity gives SMUD access to the Rocky Mountain supply basin at Opal, Wyoming, and connects to PG&E Line 300 (owned in part by SMUD) at Daggett, California.

SMUD’s diversified portfolio of gas transmission arrangements allows for the purchase of gas from a variety of suppliers and locations, and the opportunity to capitalize on regional price differentials where possible. In addition, it ensures diversity in the SMUD/PG&E backbone and enhances the reliability of SMUD’s gas supply.

**Gas Storage**

SMUD also employs gas storage as part of its overall fuel supply strategy. Gas storage is useful in helping to balance gas supply, mitigate market price volatility, and provide a reliable supply to meet peak day delivery requirements.

SMUD has a contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2023 and expires in March 2026, for capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity.

SMUD also has a second contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2022 and expires in March 2024, for additional capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity. SMUD does not plan to renew this contract upon expiration.

SMUD has a contract with Wild Goose Storage LLC, that will begin in April 2024 (but which allows for early injection (December 2023 – March 2024)) for capacity in the Wild Goose Storage project located near Gridley in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 0.2 million Dth of storage inventory, ratcheted (12,500-14,000 Dth/day) volumes of injection rights and ratcheted (10,000 – 24,000 Dth/day) volumes of withdrawal capacity.

# Power Purchase Agreements

SMUD has a number of power purchase agreements to help meet its power requirements. Some of these agreements are described below.

## Western Area Power Administration
Effective January 1, 2005, SMUD entered into a 20-year contract with WAPA. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement extending the term by 30 years for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2054. Power sold under this contract is generated by the Central Valley Project (“CVP”), a series of federal hydroelectric facilities in northern California operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The contract provides WAPA’s CVP Base Resource customers (including SMUD) delivery of a percentage share of project generation in return for reimbursement of an equivalent share of project costs. SMUD’s CVP Base Resource share is roughly 25% of project generation and costs. This is expected to be approximately 318 MW of capacity and 661 GWh of energy in an average water year but will vary depending on precipitation. Energy available under the contract is determined by water releases required for water supply and flood control and is then shaped into higher value periods within other CVP operating constraints. More capacity and energy are typically available in spring and summer months and less in fall and winter.

SMUD also has a contract with WAPA expiring December 31, 2024, by which WAPA delivers an additional 200-300 MW per hour from projects located in the Pacific Northwest based on certain contractual parameters. In 2022, SMUD received 1,913 GWh of energy under this contract. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement for the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2030.

## Avangrid (formerly Iberdrola Renewables (“Iberdrola”))
SMUD has a contract with Iberdrola for 126 GWh of wind power generated in Solano County, California. The SMUD Board approved an extension of the wind contract through June 30, 2025.

## Patua Project LLC
In April 2010, SMUD entered into a power purchase agreement with Patua Project LLC (“Patua”), a subsidiary of Gradient Resources, for the delivery of up to 132 MW (expected to be 120 MW nominal power output) of renewable energy from geothermal generation being developed in north central Nevada, from a Gradient Resources project known as the Patua Project. The Patua Project was to have been developed in three phases. Since 2010, the agreed upon capacity has been reduced several times. In December 2013, Phase 1 of the project, which had been reduced to 30 MW, finally achieved commercial operation. In 2014, the parties concluded negotiations on the fourth amendment to the power purchase agreement with Patua, which reduced the total capacity down to 40 MW, extended the commercial operation date of Phase 2 to January 1, 2016, and allowed Patua to add up to 13 MW of solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production. In addition, this amendment shifted responsibility to Patua for a portion of the long-term transmission service agreements that have been underutilized due to the project not meeting its targets. In November 2015, the Patua Project was acquired by TL Power, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cyrq Energy, Inc. (“Cyrq”). In December 2015, Cyrq terminated Phase 2. Upon termination of Phase 2, the contractual right for Cyrq to add solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production was reduced to 10 MW. As a result of poor performance during the first year of operation, SMUD reduced its obligation to take power from 30 MW to 25 MW. Performance continued to lag in 2015 and 2016 and SMUD further reduced its obligation to take power from 25 MW to 19 MW.

## Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff
In September 2009, SMUD’s Board authorized a feed-in tariff program for the purchase of renewable energy from local renewable energy projects connected to SMUD’s distribution system. SMUD’s Board authorized connection of up to 100 MW under the feed-in tariff which included standard payment rates and standard purchase terms for power. The feed-in tariff program became effective on January 1, 2010. Under the feed-in tariff, SMUD has executed 20-year term power purchase agreements. 

A-36

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

agreements for solar projects totaling 98.5 MW. Construction and start-up were completed on all projects between 2010 and 2012.

**CalEnergy LLC.** In August 2014, SMUD entered into a 22-year power purchase agreement with CalEnergy LLC for the purchase of 30 MW per year of renewable energy from its Salton Sea geothermal facilities. As of July 1, 2017, SMUD began receiving up to 10 MW from the CalEnergy portfolio, which escalated to the full 30 MWs on May 1, 2020.

**Rancho Seco Solar.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Rancho Seco Solar LLC for the purchase of energy from a 10.88 MW solar PV project sited on SMUD’s property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Commercial operation was achieved in August of 2016. Rancho Seco Solar LLC leased the property from SMUD under a land lease agreement. The output of this project directly serves two large commercial customers that executed agreements with SMUD for retail supply of solar power.

In May 2019, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement for an additional 160 MW solar PV project with Rancho Seco Solar II, LLC. The project is located on SMUD-owned property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, adjacent to the existing 10.88 MW solar PV project. Construction began in 2019, and the project became commercially operable in February 2021.

**Grady Wind Energy.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Grady Wind Energy LLC (“Grady”) for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW wind project located in New Mexico (the “Grady Project”). The Grady Project began commercial operations on August 5, 2019. Energy from the Grady Project is delivered to CAISO. SMUD purchases 100% of the Grady Project output, which includes energy, renewable energy credits, and capacity attributes.

**Great Valley Solar 2, LLC.** In January 2017, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Great Valley Solar 2, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 60 MW solar PV project located in Fresno County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was December 28, 2017.

**ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC.** On September 14, 2016, Senate Bill 859 (“SB 859”) was signed into law. Under SB 859, a POUs must procure its proportionate share of 125 MW of renewable energy from biomass plants burning high hazard forest fuels, subject to terms of at least five years. Seven POUs (SMUD, MID, Turlock Irrigation District (“TID”), Anaheim Public Utilities, Imperial Irrigation District, and Angeles Department of Water & Power and Riverside Public Utilities, collectively described herein as the “ARP-Loyalton POUs”) jointly solicited proposals for up to 29 MW of contract capacity for renewable energy to meet the requirements of SB 859. In January 2018, SMUD entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC to fulfill 18 MW of the required 29 MW with SMUD’s share being just over 23 percent (the “ARP-Loyalton PPA”). See “—Roseburg Forest Products Co.” below for a discussion of the remaining SB 859 capacity. The contract became effective on April 1, 2018. On February 18, 2020, ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and stopped producing and selling energy from the biomass plant. On May 7, 2022, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the Loyalton facility to Sierra Valley Enterprises, LLC (“SVE”). SVE initially expressed interest in bringing the facility back into service; however, the bankruptcy trustee requested requested extension of the deadline for SVE to accept or reject the ARP-Loyalton PPA. The latest deadline was April 19, 2023, the date of expiration of the ARP-Loyalton PPA terms. SVE did not resume operations before the end of the ARP-Loyalton PPA term, the ARP-Loyalton POUs have negotiated a settlement agreement with the bankruptcy trustee (the “ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement”). The ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement, which SMUD executed and is filed with the court, defines funds from the performance security that the ARP-Loyalton POUs will keep to cover legal and administrative fees, along with a contingency amount to cover potential risk of future damages. Since the ARP-Loyalton POUs entered into a five-year agreement to

A-37
<!-- Page 670 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

procure compliant biomass and provided SVE the opportunity to accept the ARP-Loyalton PPA and restart operations, the ARP-Loyalton POUs consider their statutory obligations to have been fulfilled.

**Roseburg Forest Products Co.** For the remaining SB 859 biomass obligation of 11 MW, SMUD and the other ARP-Loyalton POUs have entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with Roseburg Forest Products Co. SMUD’s share of the contract capacity is 2.5795 MW, and the plant began operating under the contract on February 26, 2021.

**Sutter Energy Center.** SMUD entered into an initial two-year contract (with a third-year exercisable option) with Calpine Energy Services, L.P. (“Calpine”) for the ability to schedule up to 258 MW of energy from Sutter Energy Center. The Sutter Energy Center is a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle facility located in Yuba City, California. The initial contract became effective on April 1, 2018. SMUD exercised its option to extend the contract, which expired November 1, 2020. SMUD entered into a new contract with Calpine for the same 258 MW of energy that became effective January 1, 2021, and had an original expiration date of January 1, 2024. In December 2021, SMUD extended this contract through December 31, 2026.

**Drew Solar, LLC.** In June 2018, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Drew Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 100 MW solar PV project located in Imperial County, California. The project’s scheduled commercial operation date was set to be December 31, 2021. The commercial operation date was delayed due to Force Majeure claims surrounding the COVID pandemic and supply chain constraints caused by changes in Federal regulatory requirements. The project began commercially operating on November 3, 2022.

**Wildflower Solar, LLC.** In October 2018, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Wildflower Solar I, LLC, for the purchase of energy, capacity, and RECs from a 13 MW solar PV project located in Rio Linda, California. The project began commercially operating on December 18, 2020.

**Coyote Creek (Formerly Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC.)** In August 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW solar PV and 100 MW four-hour Battery Energy Storage System (“BESS”) capacity project located in Sacramento County, California.

# Transmission Service Agreements

## TANC California-Oregon Transmission Project
The 340-mile COTP is one part of a three 500-kV line coordinated system known as the California-Oregon Intertie (“COI”). The COTP is allocated one-third of the 4,800 MW capability of the COI system (see related agreements below). TANC is entitled to 1,390 MW and is obligated to pay approximately 80% of the operating costs of the COTP. SMUD is a member of TANC and a party to Project Agreement No. 3 (“PA3”), under which it is entitled to 378 MW and obligated to pay on an unconditional take-or-pay basis about 27.5% of TANC’s COTP debt service and operations costs, subject to a “step-up” obligation of up to 25% of its entitlement share upon the unremedied default of another TANC member-participant. In 2009, SMUD entered into a long-term layoff agreement with certain members that increased SMUD’s entitlement by 35 MW. In 2014, SMUD entered into another long-term layoff agreement with certain other members that increased SMUD’s COTP entitlements by 128 MW and amended the 2009 layoff agreement that returned 13 MW to a member. In January 2024, SMUD entered into an agreement to extend the 2009 long-term layoff agreement with certain members to January 31, 2034. As of January 31, 2024, SMUD was entitled to approximately 528 MW of TANC’s transfer capability for imports and 405 MW for exports, and is obligated to pay approximately 38.6% of COTP debt service and operations costs. SMUD’s payments under this contract, like SMUD’s payments under its other power purchase and transmission service agreements, are treated as “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the resolutions securing the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the section “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below). SMUD relies on its COTP rights to purchase power, access contingency reserves through the Western Power Pool, and obtain renewable resources to supplement its own resources to serve its load. TANC maintains insurance coverage on a per unit/casualty insurance program. TANC’s budget for COTP costs, support services and advocacy expenses is about $45.4 million for 2023. SMUD’s obligation on the TANC budget is about $8.5 million for 2023.

## TANC Tesla-Midway Transmission Service
TANC has a long-term contract with PG&E to provide TANC with 300 MW of transmission service between PG&E’s Midway Substation and the electric systems of the TANC Members (the “Tesla-Midway Service”). SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service had been 46 MW. As part of the 2009 long-term layoff agreement, SMUD acquired an additional 2 MW of South-of-Tesla Principles (“SOTP”) transmission rights for 15 years starting February, 2009 from another TANC member, bringing SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service to 48 MW.

## Bonneville Power Administration
In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration (“BPA”) for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service from BPA’s Hilltop substation in northeastern California to the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua geothermal project over BPA’s 230kV transmission lines. In early 2013, in accordance with BPA’s transmission tariff, the transmission service was split into two 30 MW services and deferred as appropriate to better fit the timing of expected commercial operation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Patua Project LLC.” SMUD submitted another request for the 30 MW of transmission procured for Phase 2 of the Patua Project to split the service into a 10 MW and a 20 MW service, with the 10 MW service deferred and timed with the originally expected commercial operation date of Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 1 of the Patua Project and SMUD’s reduced obligation due to the poor performance of Phase 1 of the Patua Project, much of the transmission reserved for it will no longer be needed. BPA does not have a provision in its transmission tariff for early termination of transmission service. However, the power purchase agreement with Patua requires Patua to cover unused transmission that SMUD has procured for the Patua purchases. On January 1, 2020, SMUD’s transmission rights with BPA were reduced to 19 MW. This now aligns with SMUD’s PacifiCorp transmission rights of 19 MW described in the immediately following paragraph.

**PacifiCorp.** In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with PacifiCorp for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service across PacifiCorp’s high voltage step-up transformer at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In early 2013, in accordance with PacifiCorp’s transmission tariff, the commencement of the 60 MW of transmission service was deferred to fit the timing of first deliveries expected from the 30 MW of Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In 2013, SMUD terminated the 60 MW of transmission service and requested two new transmission services of 30 MW each, with service start dates timed to better fit with the expected start dates of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the reduction in expected output of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the second 30 MW transmission agreement, and replaced it with a 10 MW transmission service agreement for Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 2 of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the 10 MW PacifiCorp transmission service agreement and as a result of the reduced obligation to take power from the Patua Project, SMUD has reduced its remaining PacifiCorp transmission service from 30 MW to 19 MW.

**Western Area Power Administration.** SMUD does not have a direct interconnection of its power system to the COTP. To receive power deliveries that use its COTP rights, SMUD has a long-term transmission service agreement with WAPA for transmission of 342 MW of power from the COTP line (received at WAPA’s Tracy or Olinda substations) to SMUD’s system. In May of 2011, WAPA completed the Sacramento Voltage Support Transmission Project. Completion of this project has given SMUD an additional 165 MW of transmission service rights on WAPA’s system from the COTP at the Olinda Substation to SMUD’s system at the Elverta Substation.

**Projected Resources**

The following tables titled “Projected Requirements and Resources to Meet Load Requirements Energy Requirements and Resources” (the “Energy Table”) and “Capacity Requirements and Resources Net Capacity – Megawatts” (the “Capacity Table”) describe SMUD’s contracted commitments and owned resources available to meet its forecasted load requirements through the year 2033. Resources are shown on an annualized basis with market purchases netted against surpluses to arrive at a single net position for each year. Because SMUD’s available resources do not exactly match its actual load requirements on an hourly basis, there are times during a year when resources available will either exceed or be insufficient to meet SMUD’s needs. Expected actual capacity values are included in the tables. These values may differ from measured net demonstrated capacity values of the Local Area Gas-Fired Plants. The table below also includes the impact energy efficiency has on resource requirements as discussed below under “Demand Side Management Programs.” See “BUSINESS STRATEGY” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.”

Resources listed in both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table are listed as either renewable or non-renewable. Generally, SMUD follows the CEC guidelines for eligibility requirements. Some of SMUD’s renewable resources listed include solar, wind, geothermal, small hydroelectric facilities with a capacity of 30 MW or less, and biomass (representing generation from a fuel comprised of agricultural wastes and residues, landscape and tree trimmings, wood and wood waste).

As in any forecast, assumptions are made. In both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table the WAPA and UARP forecasts assume average water conditions throughout the period. On the capacity table, WAPA and Cosumnes Power Plant renewable capacity is estimated based on the ratio of renewable energy to total WAPA or Cosumnes Power Plant energy. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric.”

<!-- Page 673 -->
The Uncommitted Purchases (Sales) on the tables represent either anticipated future needs or surpluses. Future needs are met well in advance of delivery. They also include both renewable and non-renewable resources.

The Transmission Losses represent reductions in the amount of energy or capacity from the location it was purchased to the point of entering SMUD’s electrical system. This amount reduces the Total Resources available to meet the Total Projected Energy Requirements of the electrical system.

## Demand Side Management Programs

SMUD’s demand-side management initiatives represent an integral element of its total resource portfolio, and are organized into two major components: energy efficiency and load management programs. Energy efficiency offerings include a wide variety of programs and services to customers to retrofit or upgrade existing equipment and fixtures and to install new energy efficiency measures in existing and new construction facilities. Load management allows SMUD to reduce the load on the electric system by cycling residential air conditioning, and calling upon commercial/industrial customers to curtail energy usage when energy is constrained during the summer or system emergencies. Load management programs are projected to allow SMUD to shed approximately 60 MW of peak load in an emergency on a hot day, representing about 2% of SMUD’s maximum system peak demand.

The customer “smart meter” system with 2-way communication capability provides information regarding customer usage patterns, which is expected to help SMUD tailor rate designs that provide customers with both the information and ability to manage their energy usage around high energy cost periods.

# Balancing Authority Area Agreements

## Background
SMUD began operating as an independent control area, later termed a Balancing Authority, on June 18, 2002 within the WECC reliability organization’s region. This reduced SMUD’s exposure to the costs and reliability risks of the CAISO’s markets. SMUD expanded its operational footprint beyond SMUD’s service territory to include WAPA’s electric system, including the MID, Roseville, and Redding service areas (on January 1, 2005) and the COTP (on December 1, 2005). As described further below, SMUD ceased to be the Balancing Authority on April 30, 2011, as BANC took SMUD’s place as the Balancing Authority. SMUD remains the operator of the Balancing Authority through a contract with BANC. SMUD administers the contracts with WAPA and TANC to provide specified Balancing Authority-related and other services, and is compensated by WAPA and TANC. TANC recovers such Balancing Authority services costs as a part of its annual operating budget from the COTP Participants and WAPA recovers its Balancing Authority services costs through its rates for power and transmission service. The agreement with WAPA, among other terms, establishes operating procedures and reserve obligations between the parties and terminates on December 31, 2024. BANC, SMUD and WAPA will develop successor agreements in 2024 to take effect upon expiration of the existing contract. WAPA in turn has agreements with electric systems connected to it to assure that such systems also operate reliably (i.e., MID, Roseville and Redding). As a result of the transition to BANC as the Balancing Authority, SMUD assigned or terminated its interconnection and operations agreements with other connecting Balancing Authority areas (i.e., CAISO, BPA and TID). BANC is now the party to these agreements as they primarily address only Balancing Authority matters required for compliance with the reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”), such as emergency assistance arrangements. See also “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY” – Western Energy Imbalance Market.”

## Reliability Standards
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC authority to enforce reliability standards for the bulk electric system. In June 2007, these standards became mandatory for SMUD and BANC.

In 2022, SMUD and BANC underwent a combined NERC/WECC audit to evaluate compliance with applicable reliability standards. These audits occur every three years. At the conclusion of the audit, regulators determined that neither entity had any compliance violations related to the Operations and Planning or Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards. SMUD and BANC will undergo another NERC/WECC audit sometime in 2025.

## Balancing Authority of Northern California
SMUD, MID, Redding and Roseville executed a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (the “BANC JPA Agreement”) creating BANC on May 8, 2009. BANC became operational on May 1, 2011 as a Balancing Authority and replaced SMUD as the entity responsible for Balancing Authority-related reliability standards. Since that time, the Trinity Public Utilities District and the City of Shasta Lake have also become members of BANC. As provided in the BANC member agreement, liability for penalties associated with such Balancing Authority-related reliability standards are shared on a pro rata basis among the members of BANC. SMUD is the Balancing Authority operator under contract and performs Balancing Authority operational functions on behalf of BANC, much as it did when it was the Balancing Authority. The BANC JPA Agreement assigns cost responsibility based on member load within the BANC Balancing Authority, with SMUD representing approximately 70% of the total load.

## Power Pool and Other Agreements

### Western Power Pool Agreement
The Western Power Pool (“WPP”) is an agreement among over 30 utilities and public agencies in the western United States to coordinate contingency reserve sharing.

**TANC-SMUD OASIS Administration Agreement.** SMUD entered into an agreement with TANC to provide OASIS services (transmission sales and scheduling related services in the BANC BA of TANC members’ COTP rights) on September 29, 2005. SMUD is compensated for performing these services. TANC and SMUD entered into a letter agreement dated October 25, 2010 to clarify each party’s role for regulatory reliability standards compliance responsibilities and take into account SMUD’s increased efforts related to supporting TANC’s compliance requirements. SMUD and TANC entered into an agreement to transition this service to the Western Area Power Administration, effective on May 1, 2023. Going forward, SMUD will only have a minor role in receiving payments and distributing revenues to the TANC members.

**Other Interconnection Agreements**

**Background.** SMUD’s electric system was originally purchased from PG&E in 1947. SMUD’s service area is mostly surrounded by PG&E’s and WAPA’s service areas. The SMUD and PG&E electric systems are interconnected at SMUD’s Rancho Seco and Lake 230-kV substations. SMUD and WAPA are interconnected at SMUD’s Hurley, Elverta, Natomas and Folsom 230-kV substations.

**PG&E Interconnection Agreement.** PG&E and SMUD executed a Replacement Interconnection Agreement (“RIA”) which became effective on January 1, 2010. The RIA provides that SMUD and PG&E operate their interconnections reliably, plan their electric systems to meet their load requirements, and avoid or mitigate impacts the cause by certain electric system modifications. The agreement has a termination date of December 31, 2024, subject to FERC approval. SMUD and other Northern California utilities have similar interconnection agreements with PG&E, albeit with different expiration dates. PG&E filed a successor interconnection agreement with one of these utilities, TID, on November 1, 2023, to become effective on January 1, 2024. Many interconnection customers, including SMUD, intervened and submitted comments or protests in the FERC docket. FERC accepted the filing and TID and PG&E are now in a settlement process, pending litigation of the parties action and resolve the disputed items. SMUD anticipates that PG&E will seek to negotiate a successor interconnection agreement with SMUD which will be informed by the TID settlement or litigation process. While some functional mechanisms in the interconnection agreement may change, SMUD expects that its successor interconnection agreement will substantially preserve the balance of burdens and benefits consistent with FERC’s standard of requiring rates and terms of service that are just and reasonable. SMUD expects this process to be completed by the current expiration date of the RIA.

**PG&E Generator Interconnection Agreements.** SMUD signed a LGIA with CAISO and PG&E for the Solano 3 Wind Project, effective December 16, 2008, with a 50-year term. The Solano 2 Wind Project has interconnection rights granted through a LGIA, also with CAISO and PG&E. The agreement became effective in January 2010 and has a term of 20 years. On June 3, 2021, SMUD entered into a LGIA with the CAISO and PG&E, for the planned 90.8 MW Solano 4 Wind project with a 10-year term and automatic renewal for successive one-year terms thereafter. On February 27, 2023, SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process which combines the Solano 2, 3 & 4 projects into one Solano Wind Project. The original agreement conditions for the individual projects are carried forward with
<!-- Page 678 -->
a new combined project maximum production limit of 320.8 MW at the point of interconnection at the Russell Substation.

Other PG&E generator interconnection agreements include a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for Slab Creek with a 22-year term which became effective on January 14, 2010, and a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for the Chili Bar Project with a 10-year term which became effective on June 2, 2021.

WAPA Interconnection Agreement and other WAPA Agreements. SMUD and WAPA executed an interconnection agreement on May 8, 2008 for a term of 40 years which establishes the terms and conditions under which the SMUD and WAPA transmission systems are interconnected and memorializes related understandings. SMUD is working with WAPA on a reconfiguration at the shared Elverta interconnection to increase reliability and accommodate new generation interconnection in the area. SMUD has other agreements with WAPA including for operation of the Sutter Energy Center generating facility, communication systems terms and fiber optic access, training and for use of WAPA labor and heavy equipment to assist SMUD’s maintenance activities on an as-available basis.

![Management's Discussion of SMUD's Operating Results](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Management's+Discussion+of+SMUD's+Operating+Results)

**Management’s Discussion of SMUD’s Operating Results**

**Year Ended December 31, 2023.** For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $218.1 million as compared to an increase of $70.7 million for 2022.

Operating revenues were $228.5 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower sales of surplus gas ($118.3 million), transfers to the RSF ($67.2 million), sales to customers ($28.3 million), transfers from the RSF ($21.9 million), and LCFS revenue ($3.9 million), partially offset by higher sales of surplus power ($136.6 million), AB 32 revenue ($3.7 million), customer fees ($1.1 million), and lower transmission revenue ($2.3 million).

Operating expenses were $292.8 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower purchased power expenses ($175.5 million), production operating expenses ($146.4 million), depreciation expenses ($22.7 million), production maintenance expenses ($12.3 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($7.2 million), partially offset by higher administrative and general expenses ($33.4 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($15.8 million), public good expenses ($8.8 million), and customer service and information expenses ($6.6 million).

Non-Operating income increased by $55.2 million primarily due to fair market value assessment and gain on sale of land ($33.3 million), higher interest income ($21.7 million), higher unrealized holding gains ($11.4 million), higher CCA revenue ($5.7 million), partially offset by lower investment income ($39.1 million).

Interest expense decreased $27.9 million from 2022.

**Year Ended December 31, 2022.** For the year ended December 31, 2022, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $70.7 million as compared to an increase of $347.3 million for 2021.

Operating revenues were $363.0 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher sales to customers ($130.7 million), sales of surplus gas ($96.0 million), sales of surplus power ($62.2 million), transfers to the RSF ($28.9 million), transfers from the RSF ($24.3 million), customer fees ($9.5 million), AB 32 revenue ($4.9 million) and LCFS revenue ($2.2 million), partially offset by lower gain on sale of carbon allowance futures ($3.7 million).

Operating expenses were $601.2 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher purchased power expenses ($263.6 million), amortization of pension and OPEB ($126.9 million), production operating expenses ($125.1 million), depreciation expenses ($49.5 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($22.1 million), production maintenance expenses ($18.4 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($8.1 million), public good expenses ($7.4 million), and customer service and information expenses ($4.5 million), partially offset by lower administrative and general expenses ($27.4 million).

Non-Operating income decreased by $19.0 million primarily due to lower grant revenue ($39.6 million), unrealized holding losses ($3.7 million), partially offset by higher investment income ($19.7 million), closeout of escrow account ($2.8 million), and loss on asset retirements ($1.9 million).

Interest expense increased $19.5 million from 2021.

**Regulatory Assets.** In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” SMUD defers, as regulatory assets, certain types of expenditures. These assets are amortized and collected through future rates.

As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had a total of $916.1 million recorded for regulatory assets. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 68 which requires SMUD to record a net pension liability was $323.5 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 68 was $174.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 75 which requires SMUD to record a net Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) liability was $268.2 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 75 was $39.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with Rancho Seco decommissioning costs totaled $108.0 million at December 31, 2023. Nuclear fuel storage costs and non-radiological decommissioning costs have been collected in rates since 2009. For a complete description of these regulatory assets, see Note 8 (Regulatory Deferrals) to SMUD’s financial statements.

The Board has authorized the deferral of any charges or credits that result from the change in valuation of ineffective hedges that should be reported as Investment Revenue/Expense on the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and changes in net position. The Board’s resolution establishes that such charges or credits are not included in rates based on market value changes but are included in rates when the underlying transactions occur. Therefore, under GASB No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” any such changes are included in the Statement of Net Position as regulatory assets or liabilities. For a complete description of these derivative financial instruments, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s financial statements.

RANCHO SECO DECOMMISSIONING

Overview. The 913 MW Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant (“Rancho Seco”) began operation in 1970 and was licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”). In June 1989, the NRC issued a notice of violation against allowing SMUD to continue to operate Rancho Seco as a nuclear generating facility, and the plant was shut down. In 1991, SMUD submitted a report (the “Financial Assurance Plan”) providing financial assurance to the NRC that SMUD will have sufficient funds available to pay for the cost of decommissioning. On March 17, 1992, the NRC granted SMUD a change from operating to a possession-only license for Rancho Seco that relieved SMUD from compliance with a number of NRC regulations applicable to operating nuclear power plants. SMUD also filed a proposed decommissioning plan with the NRC (the “Decommissioning Plan”), which was approved in March 1995.

After the decommissioning efforts began, no suitable disposal option was available to SMUD for the Class B and Class C low level radioactive waste generated during the plant decommissioning. With the used nuclear fuel stored onsite requiring oversight staff, SMUD opted to store the Class B and Class C radioactive waste in an existing interim onsite storage building until a suitable disposal option was available. In November 2007, the possession-only license for Rancho Seco was amended to update the Decommissioning Plan to terminate the possession-only license for the Class B and Class C waste in two phases. Phase I of the decommissioning was completed at the end of 2008. Following verification of the site conditions, SMUD submitted a request to the NRC to reduce the licensed facility from 2,480 acres to the interim onsite storage building and about one acre surrounding it. The request was approved by the NRC in September 2009. Phase II of decommissioning included the approximately two-acre interim storage building containing the Class B and Class C radioactive waste and surrounding area. In September 2013, SMUD entered into a contract with the operator of the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility located in Andrews, Texas. Shipment of the Class B and Class C radioactive waste for disposal was completed in November 2014. SMUD conducted additional clean-up activities and radiological surveys, which were followed by NRC confirmatory surveys. The results of these surveys demonstrated unit dose criteria well below NRC release criteria, and the NRC approved the Phase II area for unrestricted use. On September 21, 2017, SMUD formally requested the termination of the possession-only license. On August A-51

31, 2018, the NRC officially terminated SMUD’s possession-only license for the remaining Class B and Class C waste at Rancho Seco.

As part of the Decommissioning Plan, the nuclear fuel and Greater Than Class C (“GTCC”) radioactive waste is being stored in a dry storage facility (the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation or “ISFSI”) constructed by SMUD, adjacent to the former reactor facility. The NRC has separately licensed this facility. The DOE, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, is responsible for permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel and GTCC radioactive waste. SMUD has a contract with the DOE for the removal and disposal of this waste. The DOE was to have a waste repository operating by 1998, but has experienced significant and ongoing delays. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act designates Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the final and exclusive repository for the nation’s used nuclear fuel. The DOE discontinued the Yucca Mountain license review activities in 2010, but after a court ordered the NRC to resume its review in 2013, the NRC published its final safety evaluation report in 2015. The final safety report, and the final environmental impact statement, concluded that the proposed repository would be safe and environmentally sound for one million years.

Nevertheless, seeking alternatives to Yucca Mountain, the Blue-Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future delivered its final report in January 2012 with several recommendations. The DOE responded to the recommendations by issuing a report in January 2013 (Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste). Key to both documents is a focus on used fuel from decommissioned sites including Rancho Seco. The DOE report accepts most of the Blue-Ribbon Commission recommendations, and contains timelines for fuel management options which proposed removing the fuel from Rancho Seco as early as 2021. However, any progress on the strategies proposed by the DOE is dependent on legislative action by Congress. With no legislative action taken to date, the 2021 projected date for removal slips year-for-year. Therefore, SMUD continues to incur costs at this time when the DOE will fulfill its contractual obligations to remove the nuclear fuel and GTCC waste from the Rancho Seco facility. In the meantime, SMUD continues to incur costs of approximately $5 to $7 million per year for storage of used nuclear fuel at the ISFSI. SMUD has filed a series of successful lawsuits against the federal government for recovery of past spent fuel costs. SMUD has recovered over $14 million in 2023. SMUD plans to continue pursuing cost recovery claims to ensure it is reimbursed for all such costs in the future. The ISFSI will be decommissioned, and its license terminated after the fuel and GTCC is removed.

Financial Assurance Plan. In accordance with the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD established and funded an external decommissioning trust fund currently held by Computershare Corporate Trust (the “Decommissioning Trust Fund”). Pursuant to the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD made the final deposit into the Decommissioning Trust Fund in 2008. Additional deposits are not expected but will be made if increased cost estimates or reduced fund interest earnings require it. In 2011, the NRC began requiring that SMUD demonstrate financial assurance for decommissioning the ISFSI as well as the former power facility, increasing the overall cost for decommissioning Rancho Seco. The estimated total cost for decommissioning the ISFSI was approximately $7.1 million on December 31, 2023. The decommissioning cost estimate is required to be updated every three years. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the Decommissioning Trust Fund was $9.4 million, excluding unrealized gains and losses. Based on the current decommissioning cost estimate and the value of the fund, SMUD’s existing Decommissioning Trust Fund provides sufficient funds to complete decommissioning and terminate the ISFSI license.

In addition to these costs, SMUD also estimates that it would cost approximately $13.1 million to restore the site to make it available for other SMUD uses with some major structures remaining intact. Site restoration is not a legal requirement. No site restoration is currently underway.

# EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

SMUD has approximately 2,334 employees, most of whom are covered by a civil service system. SMUD is a contracting member of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“PERS”). Approximately 50% of SMUD’s work-force is represented as to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment, by one of three recognized employee organizations, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) Local 1245, the Organization of SMUD Employees (“OSE”), and the SMUD Public Safety Officers’ Association (“PSOA”). The remaining 50% of SMUD’s workforce, which includes managers, professional, administrative, supervisory, confidential and security staff, is unrepresented.

SMUD negotiated a four-year Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with IBEW and the OSE, effective January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2025. Both contracts contain a no-strike/no-lockout clause effective during the life of the agreements. SMUD has an MOU with PSOA effective through December 31, 2026. SMUD has experienced only one labor interruption, which occurred in January 1980 that lasted four days.

# RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POST-EMPLOYMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

## Pension Plans

SMUD participates in PERS, an agent multiple-employer public employee defined benefit pension plan. PERS provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. PERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State. Benefit provisions are established by State statute and SMUD policies. The pension plan provides retirement benefits, survivor benefits, and death and disability benefits based upon employees’ years of credited service, age, and final compensation.

As of June 30, 2022, the last actuarial valuation date for SMUD’s plan within PERS, the market value of the SMUD plan assets was $2.32 billion. The plan is 87.8% funded on a market value of assets basis, a decrease of 12.3% compared to the June 30, 2021 funded status based on the market value of assets.

As an employer, SMUD is required to contribute a percentage of payroll each year to PERS to fund SMUD’s plan based on actuarial valuations performed by PERS. PERS collects the normal cost based on a percentage of payroll and the unfunded liability portion is based on a dollar amount. SMUD also makes partial contributions required of SMUD employees on their behalf and for their account. At the PERS fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, SMUD’s required employer contribution rate for normal cost was 9.8% of payroll and the unfunded liability contribution was $22.4 million. During 2023, SMUD contributed $37.4 million to PERS (including SMUD’s contributions to cover required employee contributions), and SMUD employees paid $18.3 million for their share of the PERS contribution.

For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025, SMUD is required to contribute 9.6% and 9.5% of payroll for normal costs and $10.7 million for fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 for the unfunded liability contribution. There is no estimated employer contribution to the unfunded liability for fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Assuming no amendments to the plan and no liability gains or losses (which can have a significant impact), PERS has projected that SMUD will be required to contribute 9.4% of payroll to the plan for normal costs and $15.7 million for the unfunded liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions. The amount SMUD is required to contribute to PERS is expected to increase in the future. The actual amount of such increases
<!-- Page 686 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

SMUD has the option to prepare an annual lump sum payment to PERS for the unfunded accrued liability portion only (not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions). SMUD made an annual lump sum prepayment of $19.5 million, and also voluntarily made an additional payment of $47.3 million, for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. SMUD was not required to make an annual lump sum prepayment and, to date, has not voluntarily made additional payments for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

While SMUD has some ability to adjust the retirement benefits provided to its employees, PERS determines the actuarial methods and assumptions used with respect to assets administered by PERS (including the SMUD plan assets) and makes the investment decisions with respect to such assets. For a description of such actuarial methods and assumptions (including the smoothing conventions used by PERS when setting employer contribution rates) and investments, see the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS (SMUD’s plan is part of the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund of PERS) available on its website at www.calpers.ca.gov. SMUD cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information and neither the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS nor any other information contained on the PERS website is incorporated by reference in or part of this Official Statement. Actuarial assessments are “forward-looking” information that reflect the judgment of the fiduciaries of the pension plans, and are based upon a variety of assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be inaccurate or be changed in the future. Actuarial assessments will change with the future experience of the pension plans.

GASB issued Statement No. 68 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – An Amendment of GASB Statement No. 27” (“GASB No. 68”). The primary objective of GASB No. 68 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for pensions. Under GASB No. 68, SMUD is required to report the net pension asset or net pension liability (i.e., the difference between the total pension liability and the pension plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of investment gains and losses. GASB No. 68 separates financial reporting from funding requirements for pension plans. The pension liability as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is $259.0 million and $235.5 million, respectively.

SMUD provides its employees with two cash deferred compensation plans: one pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 401(k) (the “401(k) Plan”) and one pursuant to IRC Section 457 (the “457 Plan” and collectively, the “Plans”). The Plans are contributory plans in which SMUD’s employees contribute the funds. Each of SMUD’s eligible full-time or permanent part-time employees may participate in either or both Plans, and amounts contributed by employees are vested immediately. Such funds are held by a trustee in trust for the employees upon retirement from SMUD service and, accordingly, are not subject to the general claims of SMUD’s creditors. SMUD makes annual contributions to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of certain employees pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with both of its collective bargaining units. SMUD matches the non-represented employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to a set amount. SMUD also makes limited discretionary contributions to non-represented employees hired after January 1, 2013, which contributions fully vest after five years. Prior to 2022, SMUD did not match employee contributions, nor make contributions on behalf of its employees to the 457 Plan. Beginning in 2022, SMUD makes annual contributions to the 457 Plan on behalf of certain employees and matches employee contributions up to a set amount pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with one of its collective bargaining units. SMUD made contributions to both Plans of $6.9 million in 2023 and to the 401(k) Plan of $7.0 million in 2022. Participating employees made contributions into both Plans totaling $34.3 million in 2023 and $32.4 million in 2022.

![Other Post-Employment Benefits](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Other+Post-Employment+Benefits)

**Other Post-Employment Benefits**

SMUD provides post-employment healthcare benefits, in accordance with SMUD policy and negotiated agreements with employee representation groups in a single employer defined benefit plan, to all employees who retire from SMUD, and their dependents. SMUD also provides post-employment healthcare benefits to covered employees who are eligible for disability retirement. SMUD contributes the full cost of coverage for retirees hired before January 1, 1991, and a portion of the cost based on credited years of service for retirees hired after January 1, 1991. SMUD also contributes a portion of the costs of coverage for these retirees’ dependents. Retirees are required to contribute the portion that is not paid by SMUD. The benefits, benefit levels, retiree contributions and employer contributions are governed by SMUD and can be amended by SMUD through its personnel manual and union contracts.

SMUD’s post-employment health care benefits are funded through the PERS California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (“CERBT”), an agent multiple-employer plan. The funding of a plan occurs when the following events take place: the employer makes payments of benefits directly to or on behalf of a retiree or beneficiary; the employer makes premium payments to an insurer; or the employer irrevocably transfers assets to a trust or other third party acting in the role of trustee, where the plan assets are dedicated to the sole purpose of the payments of the plan benefits, and creditors of the government do not have access to those assets.

SMUD has elected to contribute the normal costs to the CERBT but annually receive reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT. In 2024, SMUD’s contribution for the normal costs to CERBT is $10.6 million. In 2023, SMUD made a contribution to the CERBT for normal costs in the amount of $8.6 million. In 2022, SMUD decided to forgo making a contribution for the normal costs to the CERBT because there was a net OPEB asset as of December 31, 2021. SMUD made additional contributions to the trust. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD made healthcare benefit contributions by paying actual medical costs of $24.7 million and $24.5 million, respectively. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD received $24.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively, reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT.

At June 30, 2023 and 2022, SMUD estimated that the actuarially determined accumulated post-employment benefit obligation was approximately $403.6 and $381.7 million, respectively. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the plan was 92.3% and 97.9% funded, respectively.

SMUD’s actuary uses PERS economic and other assumptions as the basis for the calculation of the post-employment benefit obligation. The actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will vary substantially if such PERS assumptions, such as interest rate and life expectancy, among others, prove to be inaccurate or different than SMUD’s actual experience. Although SMUD believes that such assumptions and estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that any such assumptions will prove to be accurate, or that SMUD’s actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will not materially exceed its estimates. Additional information is available in Note 15 (Other Postemployment Benefits) and “Required Supplementary Information” to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

GASB previously issued SGAS No. 75 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions”. The primary objective of GASB No. 75 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for post-employment benefits other than pensions (“OPEB”). Under GASB No. 75, SMUD is required to report the net OPEB asset or net OPEB liability (i.e., the difference between the total OPEB liability and the OPEB plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of

**Outstanding Indebtedness**

**General.** SMUD typically finances its capital requirements through the sale of revenue bonds, the sale of commercial paper, from draws on its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and from internally generated funds. With the enactment of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2024 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, SMUD is monitoring and exploring new methods of financing, including those afforded under these two federal laws, that provide not-for-profit public power utilities with direct federal incentive payments.

SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Senior Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 (the “Senior Resolution”) adopted in 1971, as amended and supplemented (the “Senior Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Senior Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $1,783,965,000 outstanding. The Senior Bonds are payable solely from the Net Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Senior Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of “Maintenance and Operation Costs” and “Energy Payments” as defined in the Senior Resolution, including payments by SMUD to TANC under PA3, payments by SMUD under power purchase agreements related to the Authorities and payments by SMUD to NCGA and NCEA under their respective gas supply contracts. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD’s Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the “Subordinated Resolution”).
<!-- Page 689 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

“Subordinate Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Subordinated Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds.

SMUD issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of March 21, 2024, SMUD’s Notes were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes (and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit) are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD also entered into a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank and issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes thereunder (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in February 2022. As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

Joint Powers Authorities. SMUD has entered into long-term take-or-pay purchase agreements with SFA relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Under such agreements, SMUD has exclusive control of the dispatch of all five of the Local Gas-Fired Plants and takes all of the power produced by the Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” The Authorities are each treated as component units of SMUD for accounting purposes. Only SFA has outstanding debt, which relates solely to the Cosumnes Power Plant and is payable solely from capacity payments made by SMUD under the related power purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2023, bonds issued by SFA to finance the Cosumnes Power Plant were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $87,890,000. SMUD’s payments under the power purchase agreements relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal of and interest on the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and Subordinate Resolution.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCGA as a joint powers authority. NCGA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCGA issued $757,055,000 in bonds in May 2007 for the purpose of paying Morgan Stanley Capital Group in advance for natural gas to be delivered to NCGA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas supplies delivered by NCGA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the
<!-- Page 690 -->
![NCGA bonds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=NCGA+bonds)

NCGA bonds. As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $120,070,000 remain outstanding.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCEA as a joint powers authority. NCEA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCEA issued $539,615,000 in bonds in December 2018 for the purpose of paying J. Aron & Company LLC in advance for natural gas or electricity to be delivered to NCEA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas or electricity supplies delivered by NCEA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the NCEA bonds. [As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $537,295,000 remain outstanding. As described in the forepart of this Official Statement, the bonds issued by NCEA in 2018 are expected to be refunded with proceeds of the Bonds (as defined in the forepart of this Official Statement.)] [to be revised for 2024 Senior Bond offering documents]

**Interest Rate Swap Agreements.** SMUD has two interest rate swap agreements relating to previously or currently outstanding Subordinated Bonds, as shown in the following table. For more information, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

| Effective Date | Termination Date | SMUD Pays | SMUD Receives | Notional Amount (000's) | Counterparty |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 7/2/1997       | 7/1/2024         | Floating  | SIFMA          | 5.154%                  | $19,570      | J Aron & Company LLC |
| 07/12/2023     | 08/15/2041       | Fixed     | 0.718%         | [70% of 1M SOFR]       | 132,020      | Barclays Bank |

The obligations of SMUD under the swap agreements are not secured by a pledge of revenues of SMUD’s electric system or any other property of SMUD. SMUD does not currently have any collateral posting requirements with respect to the interest rate swap agreements, but SMUD may be required to post collateral under certain circumstances.

**Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments.** SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”) and Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series W (the “2010 Series W Bonds”) were issued as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. At the time the 2009 Series V Bonds and 2010 Series W Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive an annual cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. However, as a result of the federal budget process, many payments from the federal government, including Build America Bonds subsidy payments, have been reduced. Absent the federal budget reductions, the aggregate annual cash subsidy payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds would be approximately $9.8 million. With the current federal budget reductions, SMUD has typically been receiving aggregate annual cash subsidy payments with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds of approximately $9.2 million. It is possible that future federal budget actions could further reduce, or eliminate entirely, the annual cash subsidy payments with respect to Build America Bonds, including the annual cash subsidy payments payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. SMUD cannot predict the likelihood of the further reduction or elimination of the Build America Bonds subsidy payments. A significant reduction or elimination of the cash subsidy.

# INSURANCE

SMUD maintains a comprehensive property/casualty insurance program designed to protect against catastrophic losses that would have an adverse effect on its financial position or operational capabilities. Insurance programs are continuously reviewed and modified when construction, operational exposures, or developments in the insurance industry so warrant. Long-term relationships with a variety of insurers minimize SMUD’s susceptibility to the effects of market cycles. SMUD budgets reserves to meet potential insurance deductibles and self-insured liability claims.

SMUD safeguards assets with all-risk property and boiler/machinery insurance with limits of $800 million per occurrence for physical damage and business interruption combined. Various coverage sublimits and deductibles apply to losses arising from certain perils, such as business interruption, earthquake, or flood, respectively. Liability insurance is in effect to defend and indemnify SMUD against third party claims, including general, automobile and sudden and accidental pollution claims with policy limits of $140 million, and wildfire coverage with policy limits of $275 million, all of which include a variety of self-insured retentions.

Nuclear property and liability insurance policies are maintained in accordance with the NRC’s requirements for decommissioned nuclear plants that maintain dry storage of spent fuel on-site. This includes $100 million in first party property damage and decontamination, $100 million for nuclear liability arising from accidents on-site, $200 million for supplier’s and transporter’s nuclear liability, and $300 million for nuclear worker liability. SMUD is exposed to possible retrospective assessments for nuclear property events occurring at other nuclear facilities in the United States capped at ten times SMUD’s annual nuclear property premium (currently the maximum retrospective assessment is approximately $1,000,000).

Other types of insurance include non-owned aircraft liability, workers’ compensation, crime, cyber security, fidelity, fiduciary liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, professional errors and omissions, transportation, and builder’s risk for major facilities under construction.

# LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

SMUD is a party to numerous actions arising out of the conduct of its business and affairs, some of which are discussed below. SMUD believes that any losses or adverse financial results it may suffer in these current actions, to the extent not covered by insurance, would not, in the aggregate, have an adverse material impact on SMUD, its business and affairs, or results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

## Environmental Litigation

SMUD was one of many potentially responsible parties that had been named in a number of actions relating to environmental claims and/or complaints. SMUD has resolved these environmental claims and/or complaints and entered into settlement agreements and/or consent orders. These settlement agreements and consent orders have statutory reopener provisions which allow regulatory agencies to seek additional funds for environmental remediation under certain limited circumstances. While SMUD believes it is unlikely that any of the prior settlements or consent orders will be reopened, the possibility exists. If any of the settlements or consent orders were to be reopened, SMUD believes that the outcome will not have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

## Proposition 26 Lawsuit

In October 2019, two SMUD customers jointly filed a complaint against SMUD (subsequently one of the customers removed themselves from the complaint), which stated that SMUD’s Board violated

A-60
<!-- Page 693 -->
![Proposition 26](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Proposition+26)

**Proposition 26** (see “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Proposition 26” for a description of Proposition 26) when on June 24, 2019, it adopted rate increases for 2020 and 2021. The plaintiff contended the rates did not reflect SMUD’s reasonable cost of service because they included a 9.2% scalar that SMUD applies to its TOD residential rate restructure adopted by SMUD’s Board in the 2017 rate process. SMUD viewed the lawsuit as having little merit and while SMUD anticipated the court would rule in SMUD’s favor on substantive grounds, the plaintiff in early 2024 agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice due to their failure to diligently prosecute the case. On January 16, 2024, the court approved the dismissal.

On January 19, 2024, the same plaintiff, along with a second SMUD residential customer, jointly filed a new complaint challenging the September 21, 2023, SMUD Board adoption of 2024 and 2025 rate increases. The plaintiffs make a similar claim regarding the TOD scalar as the prior lawsuit. Given the little merit behind the lawsuit, SMUD believes the court will rule in its favor. However, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the case or, if to the extent SMUD ultimately is not successful in the litigation, what remedies against SMUD may be available. SMUD believes that if it is not successful in the litigation and to the extent the outcome would have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, the Board would make appropriate rate modifications based on an evidentiary record consistent with guidance from a judicial decision in the case.

**Other Litigation Matters**

Currently, SMUD is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints relating to its operations, including, but not limited to, property damage, personal injury, contract disputes, and employment matters. SMUD believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

**FERC Administrative Proceedings**

SMUD is involved in a number of FERC administrative proceedings related to the operation of wholesale energy markets, regional transmission planning, gas transportation and NERC reliability standards. These proceedings generally fall into the following categories: (i) filings initiated by the CAISO (or other market participants) to adopt/modify the CAISO Tariff and/or establish market design and behavior rules; (ii) filings initiated by existing transmission owners (i.e., PG&E and the other IOUs) to pass-through costs to their existing wholesale transmission customers; (iii) filings initiated by FERC to market participants to establish market design and behavior rules or investigate market behavior by certain market participants; (iv) filings initiated by transmission owners under their transmission owner tariffs to establish a regional transmission planning process; (v) filings initiated by providers of firm gas transportation services under the Natural Gas Act; and (vi) filings initiated by NERC to develop reliability standards applicable to owners, users, and operators of the bulk electric system. In addition, SMUD is an active participant in other FERC administrative proceedings, including those related to reliability, variable resource integration and the changing resource mix, and transmission planning and cost allocation. SMUD believes that determinations of these FERC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

**CPUC Administrative Proceedings**

Periodically, PG&E seeks to update its gas transmission and storage (“GT&S”) revenue requirements and rate designs. These applications are litigated at the CPUC and affect SMUD through several tariff rates SMUD pays to move natural gas along PG&E’s backbone transmission lines. In the 2019 GT&S rate case (the “2019 GT&S Case”), the CPUC affirmed the application in GT&S rates of cost causation principles to prevent excessive and unreasonable costs being shifted to electric generator. 

A-61

backbone customers like SMUD, either through proposed changes in PG&E’s natural gas storage strategy or through cost shifts within the electric generator customer class.

PG&E filed its 2023 General Rate Case (the “GRC”) in June 2021 which includes its gas transmission and storage revenue requirements. In September 2021, PG&E filed an application for approval of its Gas Cost Allocation and Rate Design Proposals (“CARD”). The CPUC issued a decision in the GRC in November 2023 authorizing PG&E’s revenue requirements for the four-year rate period of 2023-2026. SMUD is a party to the comprehensive all-party settlement agreement submitted to the CPUC for approval in June 2023 which, if approved, would resolve all open issues in the CARD proceeding. SMUD does not believe that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. SMUD will continue to actively participate in PG&E’s GRC and CARD proceedings to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to non-core customers, including electric generator backbone customers.

In the GRC, the CPUC directed PG&E to submit an application to revise its natural gas curtailment procedures “similar to the curtailment procedures of other large energy utilities”. SMUD will actively participate in this future proceeding.

Separately, SMUD continues to participate and monitor a proceeding at the CPUC concerning long-term gas system planning. At this point in these proceedings, SMUD does not anticipate that the resolution of such cases will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

SMUD monitors a number of other CPUC proceedings. These proceedings generally fall into three categories: (i) filings initiated by PG&E to adopt/modify its tariffs and/or rules; (ii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish market design and behavior rules or program rules affecting SMUD customers; and (iii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish electric and/or gas system safety design and maintenance rules. SMUD believes that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR

California Electric Market

In 1996, the State partially deregulated its electric energy market and the CAISO was established in 1998. Since the CAISO’s formation, the State has experienced episodes of higher and more volatile prices for natural gas and wholesale electricity. In reaction to such conditions, SMUD made significant changes to its business strategy to mitigate the impacts of the more volatile and unpredictable energy markets. Volatility in energy prices in the State are always a potential risk due to a variety of factors which affect both the supply and demand for electricity in the western United States. These factors include, but are not limited to, the implementation of the CAISO market design changes, insufficient generation resources, the increase in intermittent renewable energy resources, natural gas price volatility, fuel costs and availability, weather and natural disasters, transmission constraints and levels of hydroelectric generation within the region. While SMUD has taken a number of steps to mitigate its exposure to price volatility associated with these factors, this price volatility under extreme conditions may contribute to greater volatility in SMUD’s net revenues from the purchase and sale of electric energy and, therefore, could materially adversely affect the financial condition and liquidity of SMUD. For a discussion of SMUD’s current resource planning activities and risk management strategies, see “BUSINESS STRATEGY” above.

A-62
<!-- Page 695 -->
# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity continues to be a top priority for SMUD. Attacks or threats directed at critical electric or energy sector operations could damage or cause the shut-down of generation, transmission or distribution assets that are essential to SMUD’s ability to serve its customers, cause operational malfunctions and outages affecting SMUD’s electric system, and result in costly recovery and remediation efforts. The costs of security measures or of remedying breaches could be material.

SMUD participates in sharing and receiving information about cyber security threats in real-time through the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (“E-ISAC”), the central hub for such data to actively manage risk related to potential cyber intrusion. SMUD also participates in NERC’s development of mandatory, enforceable cyber security standards to address vulnerabilities in electric utility systems. SMUD also adopts voluntary measures suggested as best practices by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) in its national framework.

SMUD’s prudent response to this ever-changing threat requires constant monitoring and frequent updates to implement new regulatory requirements as they are developed. SMUD manages risk related to frequently changing regulatory requirements by participating in the development of standards at NERC and NIST and through active engagement in the cyber security policy dialogue in Congress.

# Physical Security

Physical security is a critical concern for electric utilities as they seek to protect their infrastructure from a range of threats. The electric utility infrastructure is complex and consists of multiple components, such as power plants, substations, transmission and distribution lines, and other facilities. SMUD employs a dedicated physical security team that is deployed 24/7 and allows SMUD to respond to emergent events in a safe, coordinated, efficient, and cohesive manner, protecting the lives of its employees, customers, community, properties and assets. SMUD has policies, processes and procedures in place that outline the access controls and restrictions for its properties. SMUD restricts access based on need as it determines, while adhering to applicable laws, regulations and standards such as NERC Reliability Standards and NRC regulations. SMUD also maintains a Utility Security Plan adopted by the Board representing SMUD’s compliance with the CPUC’s Safety and Enforcement Division six-step security plan process described in CPUC Decision 19-01-018.

During times of elevated, imminent threats, safety and/or security concerns, SMUD’s Security Operations team, under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer or delegate, reserves the right to deploy additional security measures, controls, and further restrict or limit access to its properties to increase its security posture.

SMUD operates a 24/7 security operations center which monitors and coordinates responses to situations reported by internal and external stakeholders, or which are detected by SMUD’s security technology. The technology includes access control, video surveillance, and various types of intrusion detection solutions. The security operations center is a central hub for initial contact for physical security calls from employees of suspicious events and initiates incident responses as needed.

# Federal Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings

## Energy Policy Act of 2005

On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct of 2005”) was signed into law. The law includes a number of energy-related provisions, including among other things limited FERC jurisdiction over interstate transmission assets of municipal utilities, cooperatives and federal utilities to order these entities to provide transmission services on rates and terms. 

A-63
<!-- Page 696 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Federal Regulation of Transmission Access.** The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the “Energy Policy Act”) made fundamental changes in the federal regulation of the electric utility industry, particularly in the area of transmission access. The Energy Policy Act provided FERC with the authority to require a transmitting utility to provide transmission services at rates, charges, terms and conditions set by FERC. The purpose of these changes, in part, was to bring about increased competition in the electric utility industry. Under the Energy Policy Act, electric utilities owned by municipalities and other public agencies which own or operate electric power transmission facilities which are used for the sale of electric energy at wholesale are “transmitting utilities” subject to the requirements of the Energy Policy Act.

Since the Energy Policy Act, FERC has adopted a series of rules to implement competitive open access to transmission facilities and regional transmission planning. Order No. 888, issued in 1996, requires the provision of open access transmission services on a nondiscriminatory basis by all “jurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does not include municipal entities like SMUD) by requiring all such utilities to file OATTs. Order No. 888 also requires “nonjurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does include SMUD) that purchase transmission services from a jurisdictional utility under an open access tariff and that owns or controls transmission facilities to provide open access service to the jurisdictional utility under terms that are comparable to the service that the nonjurisdictional utility provides itself. Section 211A of the EPAct of 2005 authorizes, but does not require, FERC to direct transmission utilities to provide transmission services, including rates and terms and conditions, that are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting utility provides transmission services to itself that are not unduly discriminatory or preferential – often referred to as the reciprocity rule.

In Order 890, issued in 2007, FERC stated that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis and retain the current reciprocity provisions.

In 2011, FERC issued Order 1000, which among other things requires public utility (jurisdictional) transmission providers to participate in a regional transmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan and that incorporates a regional and inter-regional cost allocation methodology. Similar to Order 890, FERC states that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis. However, in Order 1000, FERC appears to expand upon the current reciprocity provisions and states that it has the authority to allocate costs to beneficiaries of services provided by specific transmission facilities even in the absence of a contractual relationship between the owner of the transmission facilities and the identified beneficiary.

SMUD, individually, and through the Large Public Power Council (“LPPC”), appealed Order 1000, but in 2014 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the arguments raised on appeal, upholding the entirety of Order 1000.

The jurisdictional members of WestConnect filed their proposed regional planning process and cost allocation methodology through a series of compliance filings at FERC. FERC accepted binding cost allocation for jurisdictional transmission providers of WestConnect and mandated that non-jurisdictional transmission providers (such as SMUD) identified as beneficiaries of a project have the ability to not accept the cost allocation. WestConnect’s Order 1000 planning process began with the 2016-2017 planning cycle. 

A-64
<!-- Page 697 -->
However, in response to FERC’s WestConnect orders on compliance, El Paso Electric Company (“El Paso”), a jurisdictional transmission provider, petitioned to the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. El Paso contends that FERC’s WestConnect orders violate Order 1000’s cost causation principle because WestConnect’s binding cost allocation applies only to the jurisdictional transmission providers and thus forces jurisdictional transmission providers to subsidize projects benefiting non-jurisdictional transmission providers that opt-out of projects. The non-jurisdictional transmission providers agreed on a settlement with the jurisdictional transmission providers to resolve the matters on appeal in the 5th Circuit, but FERC ultimately did not accept the settlement. On August 2, 2023, the court reversed FERC’s orders implementing Order No. 1000 for WestConnect concerning cost allocation of regional transmission projects to non-jurisdictional transmission providers. The court found that the WestConnect orders are incompatible with Order No. 1000’s application of the cost causation principle to address free ridership. There is uncertainty at this time on the future of WestConnect’s regional planning process. FERC has not yet acted on its own in light of the Fifth Circuit’s decision, and it is uncertain whether it will act while it is working on an updated transmission planning and cost allocation proposal that could change the Order 1000 process (as further discussed below regarding the April 21, 2022 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking). It is also uncertain if and/or the extent to which the jurisdictional transmission providers in WestConnect will file revisions to the regional transmission planning provisions in their OATTs. In the meantime, the WestConnect planning has continued under the existing framework and SMUD, along with the other non-jurisdictional transmission providers, continue to participate in the WestConnect process. SMUD’s longstanding objective is to comply with open access requirements necessary to achieve reciprocity, including through participation in a regional planning process while binding itself to mandatory cost allocation. Thus, SMUD has an interest in continuing to explore options for participation in a regional transmission planning process if the WestConnect rules are modified to permit SMUD to reasonably participate consistent with its business and jurisdictional interests.

SMUD is unable to predict at this time the full impact that Order 1000, or the 5th Circuit’s August decision, will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the WestConnect process generally. However, WestConnect has conducted multiple planning cycles under its Order 1000 planning process and has not identified any project eligible for cost allocation. SMUD will continue to take any action necessary, including withdrawing from a cost allocation determination or planning region, and engaging in FERC proceedings, to ensure that it is not required to pay for transmission costs in the absence of an agreement or service relationship.

On April 21, 2022, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation and Generator Interconnection (the “NOPR”). The NOPR seeks input on proposals that would impact the Order 1000 planning and cost allocation process. SMUD has been engaged in the proceeding, providing input and helping draft comments with trade organizations, including LPPC. FERC has not issued any subsequent order. SMUD will continue to monitor and be engaged in any developments at FERC that impact the Order 1000 process and its regional transmission planning participation.

NERC Reliability Standards. The EPAct of 2005 required FERC to certify an electric reliability organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable reliability standards, subject to FERC review and approval. On February 3, 2006, FERC issued Order 672, which certified NERC as the ERO. Many reliability standards have since been approved by FERC, including those aimed at protecting the bulk electric system from physical and cyber threats.

The ERO or the regional entities, such as WECC, may enforce the reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight or FERC may independently enforce reliability standards. Potential monetary sanctions include fines of up to $1,544,521 per violation per day. Order 693 provides ERO and regional entities with 

A-65
<!-- Page 698 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the discretion necessary to assess penalties for such violations, while also having discretion to calculate a penalty without collecting the penalty if circumstances warrant.

**Anti-Market Manipulation Rules.** EPAct of 2005 gave FERC the authority to issue rules to prevent market manipulation in jurisdictional wholesale power and gas markets, and in jurisdictional transmission and transportation services. These anti-market manipulation rules apply to non-jurisdictional entities such as SMUD. Further, EPAct of 2005 provided FERC civil penalty authority, which the Commission has stated that it will exercise carefully by assuring that its market manipulation rules are clear.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions.** Since 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions from different sources, including from the electric sector.

In 2014, EPA issued a proposed rule under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) called the Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”) that projected power sector emissions reductions of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed CPP would have established a rate-based emissions goal for each state, providing states the responsibility to develop a State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) describing how each will meet the goal assigned by EPA using the “Best System of Emissions Reduction” (“BSER”) established by EPA. The rule was finalized in October 2015.

In November 2015, 27 states and numerous corporations challenged the CPP in court, alleging that EPA had exceeded its authority under the CAA; however, before the issue could be decided by the court, the 2016 presidential election resulted in a change of administration. The new administration quickly moved for an abeyance (or stay) of the case for as long as the agency needed to review and withdraw the CPP. The U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay of the pending disposition in the D.C. Circuit and any subsequent review by the Supreme Court. In August 2018, EPA proceeded to withdraw the CPP and the D.C. Circuit ultimately dismissed the case on September 17, 2019. EPA proposed a different rule under the same provision of the CAA, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which would have established a BSER that only includes measures that can be undertaken at an individual power plant, rather than the broader suite of measures envisioned under the CPP. The ACE rule was challenged in court by environmental groups and states alleging that the revised rule inadequately responds to EPA’s responsibility to protect public health and welfare. SMUD joined in this litigation along with other challengers. The D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule on January 19, 2021, and remanded it to the EPA for review and revision, just days before a new presidential administration took office. Several states led by West Virginia and coal industry members appealed the decision.

In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in West Virginia v. EPA, striking down the CPP and foreclosing any future regulations of “significant political and economic significance” if Congress has not expressly authorized them. While the decision does not restrict EPA to only requiring measures “inside the fence line” at an individual power plant to control GHGs, it appears unlikely that the EPA will be able to require material reductions in GHGs to mitigate climate change through section 111(d) of the CAA.

Under the new presidential administration, in May 2023, the EPA issued a proposed rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA to reduce GHG emissions from existing and new power plants. The four-part proposed rule, **New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; and Repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy Rule**, would set both GHG emission standards for certain subcategories of new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants operating greater than 50% of the time and generating more than 300 MW per turbine. In the proposed rule, EPA determined the BSER is either deploying carbon capture and storage

A-66

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

technology to capture 90% of emissions or co-firing 96% hydrogen produced through a low-emission process (“low-GHG hydrogen”). If finalized, compliance is required by 2032. SMUD has filed comments as part of several trade groups and coalitions in response to the proposed rule. SMUD’s internal analysis shows the rule as proposed would not require changes at any of its currently-operating fossil-fueled power plants and therefore will not have a material impact on SMUD’s financial position, operations, or liquidity.

## Federal Communications Commission

The 1978 Pole Attachment Act added section 224 to the Communications Act of 1934, authorizing the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to regulate attachments by cable television systems or providers of telecommunications service to utility poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way. Under Section 224(a)(1), public power entities are exempt from FCC pole attachment regulations, as municipally-owned poles are already subject to local decision-making processes and governance. The municipal exemption from FCC pole attachment regulations was further codified through the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, over the past decade, this exemption has been continuously eroded.

Various actions by the FCC have limited the exemption in support of a “uniform policy for broadband access to privately-owned physical infrastructure.” Through four orders issued between 2017 and 2018, the FCC set strict time limits for the review of pole attachment applications and preempted state and local agreements on pole attachments. In 2020, in *City of Portland v. United States*, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the FCC’s Small Cell Order, which adopted new time limits for municipal utilities’ review of wireless infrastructure siting applications and preempted access for small cell installations. In November 2023, the FCC adopted its Fourth Report and Order, Declaratory Ruling, and Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which established new rules and the fast-track approval process for pole attachment applications, among other things. SMUD will monitor this proceeding for any potential impact to SMUD.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new FCC rulemakings will impact the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system.

## Federal Clean Energy Legislation

SMUD actively participates in discussion at the federal level regarding legislation that would meaningfully impact SMUD’s existing GHG reduction strategies or impose new requirements for electric generators, including a proposed federal clean energy standard. In the 117th Congress, a clean electricity performance program was considered but ultimately lacked support to pass. Instead, Congress extended and expanded clean energy tax credits and created new grant and rebate programs to incentivize clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While it is possible that a future Congress may revisit the concept of a clean energy standard or other GHG reduction regime, it is possible that the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will diminish the likelihood of a new regulatory framework being enacted in the near future.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new EPA rulemakings will be undertaken, and what the full impact of the reduction of fossil-based generation over time will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the electric utility industry generally.

## State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills provide for reduced GHG emission standards and greater investment in energy efficient and environmentally friendly generation alternatives through more stringent RPS. Additionally, ongoing regulatory proceedings address the implementation of these bills as well as water flow and quality.

![Greenhouse Gas Emissions Summary](https://example.com/image.png)

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
On September 27, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (“AB 32”). AB 32 requires the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to adopt enforceable GHG emission limits and emission reduction measures in order to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In addition, AB 32 establishes a mandatory reporting program for all IOUs, local, publicly-owned electric utilities and other load-serving entities (electric utilities providing energy to end-use customers) (“LSEs”). The AB 32 reporting program allows CARB to adopt regulations using market-based compliance mechanisms such as a “cap-and-trade” system.

On December 16, 2010, CARB approved a resolution adopting cap-and-trade regulations for the State. The regulations became effective on January 1, 2012. As adopted, the cap-and-trade program covers sources accounting for 85% of the State’s GHG emissions, the largest program of its type in the United States. In November of 2012, CARB conducted its first allowance auction and auctions now occur on a quarterly schedule.

The cap-and-trade program introduced a hard emissions cap that declines over time on the combined electric utility and large industrial sectors, covering all sources emitting more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases (“CO2e”) per year, and was subsequently expanded to cover distributors of transportation, natural gas, and other fossil fuels. The cap-and-trade program requires covered entities to retire compliance instruments (allowances and carbon offsets) for each metric ton of CO2e they emit. CARB has allocated allowances to LSEs to mitigate the compliance cost burden on ratepayers. The value of allowances must be used to benefit ratepayers and achieve GHG emission purposes (not exceeding 8% of a regulated entity’s compliance obligation through 2020, 4% from 2021 through 2025, and 6% from 2026 through 2030). Offsets must be obtained from certified projects in sectors that are not regulated under the cap-and-trade program and are subject to other restrictions.

The State's cap-and-trade program was briefly linked to companion program in the Canadian province of Ontario during 2018 but was de-linked following a political change. In 2021, the Washington state legislature passed a cap-and-trade bill, which is expected to interact with the State’s markets. Future potential near-term links to the CARB cap-and-trade program also include the states of Oregon, which has adopted a cap-and-trade program, and New Mexico, which is considering the adoption of a cap-and-trade program.

On October 7, 2015, SB 350 was enacted, containing aggressive goals for reducing carbon emissions by 2030, including raising the proportion of renewable energy to 50%, reducing the use of petroleum fuel in cars and trucks by up to 50%, and doubling the energy efficiency of existing buildings. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” for additional information. In addition, SB 350 established requirements for larger POUs to adopt and file with the CEC Integrated Resource Plans (“IRPs”) by April 2019 that should planned procurement to achieve the 50% RPS and State GHG goals established by CARB. The CEC developed “guidelines” for these IRPs for POUs in 2017, updated them in 2018, and proposed additional updates in 2022. CARB established specific GHG target ranges for these IRPs in summer 2018, which were revised in 2023 following the adoption of CARB’s 2022 Scoping Plan. SMUD developed and adopted an IRP in 2018 through a comprehensive public process and filed the adopted IRP with the CEC in April 2019. SMUD adopted an updated IRP in June 2022 and filed the updated IRP with the CEC in September 2022, but the CEC has not yet completed its review of SMUD’s 2022 IRP. SMUD’s updated IRP plans for a greater than 92% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 relative to 1990 levels, which equals approximately

250,000 metric tons of GHG emissions in 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change.”

On April 29, 2015, the Governor of the State signed Executive Order B-30-15, establishing a goal for the State to reduce GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2016, the State Legislature passed Senate Bill 32 (“SB 32”), which codified then-Governor Brown’s goal of reducing the State’s GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2017, the State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 398 (“AB 398”), explicitly authorizing the continuation of the cap-and-trade program, with designated changes, through 2030. Subsequently, CARB adopted an initial set of regulatory changes extending the cap-and-trade program, including establishing utility sector allowance allocations through 2030. In 2018, CARB completed a rulemaking to implement the cap-and-trade program changes designated by AB 398. These changes include development of a hard price ceiling for the cap-and-trade program and two price-containment points below that ceiling, in an attempt to ensure stable prices in the program. CARB adopted final regulations on December 13, 2018.

In addition, any new projects constructed in the State, including power plants, that may cause a significant adverse impact on the environment must be analyzed under CEQA. Some State agencies have begun using CEQA in novel ways to require mitigation of “significant” GHG emissions caused, either directly or indirectly, by a project. Pursuant to Senate Bill 97 passed in 2007, CARB will assist the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research in setting thresholds of significance under CEQA of GHG impacts from new projects. This is an area of State law that is evolving and unsettled in the courts. However, there is a risk that any project proponent of an electric system infrastructure project might have to mitigate such potential impacts to a level of less than significant.

On December 3, 2012, the Superior Court of California ruled in Environmental Defense Fund v. San Diego Association of Governments (“SANDAG”), Case No. 2100-0011593, that sided with the State Attorney General and the other petitioners stating that SANDAG did not follow CEQA when it adopted a $257 billion regional transportation plan in 2011. The ruling expressly invalidated the certification of the Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) on the grounds that the EIR should have analyzed the plan’s consistency with the governor’s policy goal to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050 as articulated in the 2005 Executive Order S-03-05. On November 24, 2014, the Fourth Appellate District upheld the trial court in a published decision, and SANDAG appealed to the State Supreme Court. On July 13, 2017, the Supreme Court reversed and held that SANDAG’s decision to not adopt the 2050 goal was not an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, the Court articulated three clear principles for agencies to follow in their CEQA review of planning documents: 1) agencies must take seriously the significance of even small increases in GHG emissions; 2) they must consider science-based State policy guidance in their decision-making; and 3) they are required to use the best scientific information available to determine whether their planning decisions are consistent with the State’s goals. These principles will apply to SMUD in CEQA reviews of future projects.

On September 29, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law Senate Bill 1368 (“SB 1368”), the GHG Emissions Performance Standard (“EPS”). SB 1368 limits long-term investments in baseload generation by the State’s utilities to power plants that meet an EPS jointly established by the CEC and the CPUC. The agencies have set the EPS at 1,100 pounds CO2 per MWh, which is roughly half of the CO2 emissions rate of a conventional coal-fired power plant. CEC regulations to implement the law for POUs were approved by the Office of Administrative Law on October 16, 2007.

SMUD’s primary supply and demand-side resources need to meet customers’ electric usage patterns over the next 10 years. Currently there is a ban in the State that prohibits the development of nuclear power plants until there is a permanent storage solution for spent fuel rods. With the effective ban on new coal power imports under SB 1368, natural gas-fired, combined cycle power plants would appear

A-69

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+available)

to be the primary viable option for fossil fuel-based baseload power plant development absent the implementation of new technologies in connection with other resource options. The reliance on a single fuel source will continue to put pressure on the natural gas market in the United States. SMUD has in place a natural gas procurement plan to mitigate natural gas volatility, see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply” above.

On September 16, 2022, the Governor of the State signed into law SB 1020, which creates interim climate targets under which eligible renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources must supply 90% of all retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers by December 31, 2035, and 95% by December 31, 2040. The bill also requires each State agency to ensure that zero carbon resources and eligible renewable energy resources supply 100% of electricity procured on its behalf by December 31, 2035. SMUD provides electricity to a number of State agency buildings and will work with State agencies to comply with this requirement.

On October 7, 2023, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 1305, which requires an entity that purchases or uses voluntary carbon offsets and makes claims regarding the achievement of net zero, or other similar claims, to disclose on their website specified information. Many stakeholder groups are raising questions on if this includes RECs. Clean-up legislation could follow. It is not clear at this time whether RECs are included.

Reliability. On June 30, 2022, the Governor signed the 2022-23 budget, along with a number of trailer bills, which provide implementing details on the budget line items. Included in AB 205, the energy trailer bill, are a number of reliability programs.

1. CEC Distributed Electricity Backup Assets Program to incentivize the construction of cleaner and more efficient distributed energy assets that would serve as on-call emergency supply or load reduction for the state’s electrical grid during extreme events. The CEC adopted program guidelines in October 2023 and issued the first solicitation in December 2023.

2. CEC Demand Side Grid Support Program to pay customers to reduce demand during stressed grid events. SMUD has actively engaged the CEC on the development and subsequent revision of program guidelines. The CEC is expected to revise the guidelines again for summer 2024.

3. DWR Strategic Reliability Reserve to secure resources for summer reliability or to preserve the option to extend the life of facilities that otherwise would retire, new temporary generators of more than five MW, new energy storage systems of at least 20 MW, generation facilities that use clean, zero-emission fuel technologies, or new zero-emission technologies that can be operational by December 31, 2026.

As a follow up to this legislation, the Governor signed into law AB 1373. The bill authorizes the CEC to annually assess a capacity payment on a POU within the CAISO balancing authority area during a month in which the POU fails to meet its minimum planning reserve margin. This does not include SMUD, who is within the BANC balancing authority area. SMUD is, however, required to submit to the CEC an assessment of whether it exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin and system resource adequacy requirements. This bill also allows the DWR, for certain types of long-development projects, to act as a central procurement entity. For POUs, participation in the DWR program would be optional.

Zero-Emission Fleet Mandates. CARB has adopted the Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”) regulation, requiring certain medium- and heavy-duty (“MHD”) vehicle fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles through purchase requirements or fleet composition requirements, which took effect on November

A-70
<!-- Page 703 -->
1, 2023, and applies to all publicly owned MHD fleets, larger commercially owned MHD fleets, and drayage trucks. Under the ACF Rule, public fleets like SMUD have two compliance options. The first is a zero-emission vehicle (“ZEV”) purchase requirement, under which 50% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2024, and 100% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2027. The second is an optional ZEV milestone option, under which the composition of the MHD fleet would need to meet certain ZEV percentages starting in 2025, with the entire fleet transitioned no later than 2042. The individual milestones depend on the number and category of vehicles in the fleet. Public fleets may opt into the ZEV milestone option until January 1, 2030. In 2024, SMUD plans to comply with the purchase requirement option, meaning that 50% of the MHD vehicles purchased in 2024 will be ZEVs. SMUD plans to monitor ZEV market developments and currently expects to opt into the ZEV milestone option as more ZEVs become available. The ACF Rule also accelerates a manufacturer ZEV sales requirement to 100% of all MHD truck sales by the 2036 model year.

CARB proposed the Zero-Emission Forklift regulation in November 2023. The regulation would require forklift fleets to transition spark-ignited forklifts to zero-emission technology starting in 2026. The regulation would apply to SMUD, as a forklift operator. Since SMUD has a limited number of forklifts, this regulation is not expected to have a material effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operation.

Transportation and Building Electrification. In recent years, the State has identified transportation and building electrification as key strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, and is advancing policy to support or accelerate electrification. For example, in addition to the zero-emission fleet mandates and LCFS regulation discussed herein, CARB adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks regulations to require vehicle manufacturers to increase sales of zero-emission vehicles, respectively. The CEC’s Building Energy Efficiency Standards are also encouraging the use of electric heat pumps in new homes and certain non-residential buildings across the state. The draft 2025 Energy Standards, which are expected to be proposed by April 2024 and adopted by August 2024, would establish prescriptive heat pump requirements for both space and water heating in new homes, and may require existing homes to install a heat pump when replacing an air conditioner. The 2025 Energy Standards, if approved, would take effect on January 1, 2025. In addition, the State has also provided funding for programs to encourage clean transportation and building electrification.

Increases in transportation and building electrification will result in increased customer usage of electricity.

Renewables Portfolio Standard. Senate Bill 100 was passed by the Legislature and approved by Governor Brown on September 10, 2018. Among other requirements, the bill sets a 50% RPS target for 2026 and sets compliance period targets at 44% by December 31, 2024, 52% by December 31, 2027, and 60% by December 31, 2030. The bill also creates a statewide planning goal to meet all of the state’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.

Sacramento-San Joaquin River Bay-Delta Processes. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is an expansive inland estuary, formed at the western edge of the California Central Valley by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers (“Delta”). There are two substantial Delta planning processes with the potential to affect (1) energy available for SMUD’s purchase from the Central Valley Project (“CVP”) and (2) flows within the Upper American River watershed. These processes are called the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan (“Bay-Delta Plan”) and the Delta Conveyance Project.

The Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan is updated periodically by the State Water Resources Control Board (“SWRCB”), the last time being in 2006. The current Bay-Delta Plan update process is being implemented in four phases. The first phase considered southern Delta water quality, with a

**A-73**

**respect to fees and charges for general purposes, and a two-thirds voter approval requirement with respect to fees and charges for special purposes, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. The initiative, according to its supporters, is intended to prevent the circumvention of tax limitations imposed by the voters pursuant to Proposition 13, approved in 1978, and other measures through the use of non-tax fees and charges. Proposition 26 expressly excludes from its scope a charge imposed for a specific local government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable cost to the local government of providing the service or product. Proposition 26 is not retroactive as applied to local governments. Although SMUD believes that the initiative was not intended to apply to fees for utility services such as those charged by SMUD and its fees and charges meet the criteria of the exclusion described above, it is possible that Proposition 26 could be interpreted to further limit fees and charges for electric utility services and/or require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes. SMUD is unable to predict at this time how Proposition 26 will be interpreted by the courts or what its ultimate impact will be. As of the date of this Official Statement, SMUD is unaware of any fees or charges relating to SMUD’s service that would have to be reduced or eliminated because of Proposition 26. However, certain of SMUD’s adopted rate increases have been challenged. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”**

**Initiative 1935.** A voter initiative entitled “The Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act” (“Initiative 1935”) has been determined to be eligible for the State’s November 2024 statewide general election and, unless withdrawn by its proponent prior to June 27, 2024, will be certified as qualified for the ballot in such election. Were it to be approved by a majority of voters in the election, Initiative 1935 would amend Article XIII C of the State Constitution to, among other things, provide that charges (or increases in charges) imposed or extended by a local government after January 1, 2022 for services or products provided directly to the payor (including, potentially, fees and charges for electric service or product) are “taxes” subject to voter approval unless the local government can provide convincing evidence that the charge is reasonable and does not exceed the “actual cost” of providing the service or product. Initiative 1935 defines “actual cost” as “(i) the minimum amount necessary to reimburse the government for the cost of providing the service or the product to the payor and (ii) where the amount charged is not used by the government for any purpose other than reimbursing that cost.” Initiative 1935 would also require that local governments impose fees and charges by ordinance (which may be subject to referendum). If adopted, Initiative 1935 would be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is unable to predict whether and how Initiative 1935, if approved, would be interpreted or applied, but it is possible any such interpretation or application could further limit future fees and charges or future increases in fees and charges for electric utility services, require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes and/or otherwise adversely impact SMUD and its revenues. In response to an emergency petition filed by Governor Gavin Newsom, with support from the League of California Cities and others, the California Supreme Court has unanimously agreed to decide whether the initiative should appear on the November 2024 ballot or be disqualified. A ruling is expected before June 30, 2024, which is the deadline for placing items on the November 2024 ballot. 

**On November 2, 2023, Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 13 (“ACA 13”) was filed with the Secretary of State and will be on the ballot for the November 2024 statewide general election. If approved by voters, ACA 13 would require any initiative constitutional amendment appearing on the ballot on or after January 1, 2024, that would increase the voter approval requirement to adopt any State or local measure to be approved by the highest voter approval requirement that the initiative measure would impose. In other words, if ACA 13 is approved by voters, its express terms appear to require Initiative 1935 to pass with a 2/3 vote, since Initiative 1935 would extend a 2/3 voter requirement to additional State and local fees and charges. If adopted, ACA 13 and its effect on the adoption of Initiative 1935, if applicable, are likely to be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is not able to predict whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would be interpreted or applied or whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would affect the adoption, interpretation or application of Initiative 1935, if adopted.**

![Wildfire Legislation](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Wildfire Legislation.** In response to catastrophic wildfires in California, legislation was adopted and signed into law requiring POUs (including SMUD), IOUs, and electrical cooperatives to construct, maintain and operate their electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by electrical lines and equipment. Senate Bill 247 (“SB 247”), signed by Governor Newsom on October 2, 2019, establishes notification, audit and reporting guidelines for electrical corporations relating to vegetation management requirements in the wildfire mitigation plan. SB 247 also specifies the qualifications for electrical line clearance tree trimmers performing work to comply with the vegetation management requirements in an electrical corporation’s wildfire mitigation plan and requires that qualified line clearance tree trimmers be paid no less than a specified prevailing wage rate. POUs are not required to adhere to SB 247, but the market impacts are projected to significantly increase SMUD’s annual vegetation management costs.

**Nonstock Security.** SMUD sponsored legislation in 2019, Assembly Bill 689, which was signed into law by Governor Newsom on September 5, 2019. This bill expressly allows SMUD the ability to operate a pilot project (effective January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2025), of up to three acquisitions, to hold nonstock security in a corporation or other private entity if acquired as part of a procurement of goods or services from that entity, provided that no separate funding is expended solely for the nonstock security. This will allow SMUD to realize the financial benefits of its investments, partnerships, and intellectual property.

On September 15, 2022, the Board authorized the CEO & GM to enter into a joint collaboration agreement with ESS Tech, Inc. (“ESS”). Under that agreement SMUD would procure from ESS in flow batteries for utility scale long-duration energy storage applications. The agreement contemplates a multi-year phased deployment of up to 200MW/2GWh of long duration energy storage by 2028. As part of this procurement, SMUD acquired nonstock security in ESS.

SMUD will be sponsoring legislation in 2024 to extend the authority granted by Assembly Bill 689 to future years.

**Future Regulation**

The electric industry is subject to continuing legislative and administrative reform. States and Federal entities routinely consider changes to the way in which they regulate the electric industry. Recently, both further deregulation and forms of additional regulation have been proposed for the industry, which has been highly regulated throughout its history. SMUD is unable to predict at this time the impact any such proposals will have on the operations and finances of SMUD or the electric utility industry generally.

**OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY**

**CAISO Market Initiatives**

The CAISO routinely conducts a number of initiatives and stakeholder processes that propose certain operational and market changes that impact SMUD. SMUD does and will continue to monitor the various initiatives proposed by the CAISO and participate in its stakeholder processes to ensure that its interests are protected.

SMUD participates in the CAISO market for only a small percentage of energy needs, however, it continues to benefit from its participation in the CAISO’s WEIM and is currently exploring further participation in the CAISO’s proposed Extended Day Ahead Market (“EDAM”) (both the WEIM and EDAM are described further below). Along with monitoring other key market initiatives at the CAISO which impact wholesale energy markets, SMUD will continue to actively participate in all processes related

A-74
<!-- Page 707 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to EIM and EDAM, to ensure both participation models are beneficial to SMUD’s customers. Given its success in EIM and active engagement with the CAISO and CAISO leadership, SMUD has earned a key role in the stakeholder processes related to these important and evolving markets.

**Resource Adequacy Filing**

In September 2005, the State Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Assembly Bill 380 (“AB 380”), which requires the CPUC to establish resource adequacy requirements for all LSEs within the CPUC’s jurisdiction. SMUD is not an LSE subject to the CPUC’s jurisdiction. In 2005, the CPUC issued a decision requiring jurisdictional LSEs to demonstrate that they have acquired capacity sufficient to serve their forecast retail customer load plus a minimum 15% planning reserve margin. In June 2022, the CPUC issued a decision increasing the minimum planning reserve margin to 16% for 2023 and 17% for 2024. In June 2023, the CPUC kept the minimum planning reserve margin at 17% for 2024 and extended the 17% requirement for 2025.

AB 380 also required publicly owned utilities, including SMUD, to meet the most recent resource adequacy standard as adopted by the WECC. The WECC has yet to formally adopt a resource adequacy requirement. However, consistent with current WECC practices, SMUD utilizes a minimum 15% planning reserve margin when assessing the need for future resources. For summer 2023, SMUD attained a 17% planning reserve margin and will have at least a 17% planning reserve margin for summer 2024 as well.

In 2022, the State Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 209 (2022) (“AB 209”), which requires the CEC to develop recommendations about approaches to determining an appropriate planning reserve margin for local publicly owned utilities within the CAISO balancing authority area. The CEC has initiated a proceeding and plans to publish a report with a recommended methodology on summer 2024. The report will not directly impact SMUD since SMUD is not in the CAISO; nevertheless, SMUD is monitoring the proceeding. The State Legislature also passed Assembly Bill 1373 (2023) (“AB 1373”) that requires the CEC to submit a report to the Legislature that assesses whether each local publicly owned electric utility in California (both inside and outside the CAISO) exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin for 2023. The report must also assess whether local publicly owned utilities met the planning reserve margin for June through September 2023 established by the CPUC’s June 2022 decision (i.e., 16%). See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Reliability.”

While SMUD believes the CEC’s report will show SMUD met both its 15% planning reserve margin and the CPUC’s 16% planning reserve margin for 2023, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the report, or what the Legislature intends to do with the report. To the extent the CEC or Legislature imposes a higher POU planning reserve margin for future years that includes SMUD, the ultimate impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy/capacity, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers; however, such impacts could be material.

**Western Energy Imbalance Market and Extended Day Ahead Market**

Federal and state policymakers have long-promoted the development of organized markets in the west as a means (among other reasons) to better integrate intermittent renewable resources into the electric system, the first of which markets is the Western EIM, operated by the CAISO. The CAISO successfully launched the WEIM, a real time only imbalance market, on October 1, 2014, with PacifiCorp as the first participant. Since this time, the WEIM has grown significantly with the addition of 21 other Balancing

to sell to nongovernmental entities electricity from generation projects and transmission service from transmission line projects financed with tax exempt obligations; (i) effects of inflation on the operating and maintenance costs of an electric utility and its facilities; (j) changes from projected future load requirements; (k) increases in costs and uncertain availability of capital; (l) issues relating to supply chains and the uncertain availability or increased costs of necessary materials; (m) shifts in the availability and relative costs of different fuels (including the cost of natural gas); (n) sudden and dramatic increases in the price of energy purchased on the open market that may occur at times of high peak demand in an area of the country experiencing such high peak demand, such as has occurred in the State; (o) issues relating to risk management procedures and practices with respect to, among other things, the purchase and sale of natural gas, energy and transmission capacity; (p) other legislative changes, voter initiatives, referenda and statewide propositions; (q) effects of changes in the economy; (r) effects of possible manipulation of the electric markets; (s) natural disasters or other physical calamities, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, droughts, severe weather, wildfires and floods; (t) changes to the climate, including increasing volatility in rainfall in the Western United States and a reduction in the depth and duration of the Sierra snowpack; (u) issues relating to cyber-security; and (v) outbreaks of infectious diseases or the occurrence of pandemics. Any of these factors (as well as other factors) could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of any given electric utility, including SMUD’s electric utility, and likely will affect individual utilities in different ways.

SMUD is unable to predict what impact such factors will have on the business operations and financial condition of SMUD’s electric system, but the impact could be significant. SMUD has taken major steps to mitigate the impacts of many of the changes. This Official Statement includes a brief discussion of certain of these factors. This discussion does not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and matters are subject to change subsequent to the date hereof. Extensive information on the electric utility industry is available from the legislative and regulatory sources and other sources in the public domain, and potential purchasers of any of SMUD’s Senior Bonds or Subordinated Bonds described in the forepart of this Official Statement should obtain and review such information.

## PROPOSED FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL

[Closing Date]

Northern California Energy Authority  
Sacramento, California  

Northern California Energy Authority  
Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Northern California Energy Authority (the “Issuer”) in connection with issuance of $__________ aggregate principal amount of Northern California Energy Authority Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”), issued pursuant to an amended and restated trust indenture, dated as of __________, 2024 (the “Trust Indenture”), between the Issuer and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (as successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association), as trustee (the “Trustee”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Trust Indenture.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Trust Indenture; the Commodity Purchase Agreement; the Commodity Supply Contract; the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 10, 2018, the Amended & Restated Schedule, dated as of __________, 2024, and the Amended and Restated Confirmation thereto, dated __________, 2024 (collectively, the “Issuer Commodity Swap”); each between the Issuer and Royal Bank of Canada (the “Commodity Swap Counterparty”); the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of December 10, 2018, the Amended & Restated Schedule, dated as of __________, 2024, the Amended & Restated Credit Support Annex, dated as of __________, 2024, and the Amended & Restated Confirmation thereto, dated __________, 2024 (collectively, the “Supplier Commodity Swap”), each between the Commodity Swap Counterparty; the Tax Certificate dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”); between the Issuer and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”); opinions of counsel to the Issuer, the Trustee and SMUD; certificates of the Issuer, the Trustee, SMUD and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not be, relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters. Our engagement with respect to the Bonds has concluded with their issuance, and we disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to us (whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than the Issuer. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents and the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to in the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Trust Indenture, the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract, the Issuer Commodity Swap, the Supplier Commodity Swap and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax.

purposes. We call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Bonds, the Trust Indenture, the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract, the Issuer Commodity Swap, the Supplier Commodity Swap and the Tax Certificate and their enforceability may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against joint powers authorities and municipal utility districts in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the assets described in or as subject to the lien of the Trust Indenture or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein or, of the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such assets. Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official Statement or other offering material relating to the Bonds and express no opinion with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1. The Bonds constitute the valid and binding limited obligations of the Issuer.

2. The Trust Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of, the Issuer. The Trust Indenture creates the valid pledge which it purports to create of the revenues, moneys, securities and funds comprising the Trust Estate pledged under the Trust Indenture, subject only to the provisions of the Trust Indenture permitting the application thereof for the purposes and on the terms

3. Interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax. We observe that interest on the Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds.

Faithfully yours,

ORRICK, HERRINGTON & SUTCLIFFE LLP

# APPENDIX G

## BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), New York, New York, will act as securities depository for the Bonds. The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of the Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC. If, however, the aggregate principal amount of any maturity of the Bonds exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such maturity.

DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA-. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.

Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.

**G-2**  

Representative of DTC. The deposit of Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership.  

DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.  

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to take certain steps to augment transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Bond documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of the notices be provided directly to them.  

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within a maturity of the Bonds are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such maturity to be redeemed.  

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the issuer of securities as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).  

Redemption proceeds and payments of principal and interest on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from NCEA or the Trustee on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, NCEA or the Trustee, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds and principal and interest to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of NCEA or the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.  

DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by giving reasonable notice to NCEA or the Trustee. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered.
<!-- Page 717 -->
NCEA may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates are required to be printed and delivered to DTC.

The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that NCEA believes to be reliable, but NCEA takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

contemplated hereby to take place at the time of such payment and delivery being herein sometimes called the “Closing”).

It shall be a condition to the Underwriter’s obligation to purchase, to accept delivery of and to pay for the Bonds, that the entire $000,000,000 principal amount of the Bonds shall be issued, sold and delivered by the Issuer at the Closing.

SECTION 2. OFFICIAL STATEMENT; COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 15c2-12.

(a) The Issuer hereby confirms that it has “deemed final” as of its date of the Preliminary Official Statement, dated ________, 2024, relating to the Bonds (the “Preliminary Official Statement”) for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 15c2-12 (“Rule 15c2-12”) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except for the omission of only such material as is permitted by such paragraph.

(b) Within seven business days after the execution of this Purchase Contract (but in any event not less than two business days prior to the date of Closing), the Issuer shall prepare and deliver to the Underwriter a final Official Statement of the Issuer relating to the Bonds executed by the Issuer as indicated thereon, such Official Statement to be in the substantially the same form as the Preliminary Official Statement with such changes as shall be necessary to complete such form and such other changes as may be approved by the Underwriter (such document, including the cover page, inside front cover and Appendices attached thereto, is referred to herein as the “Official Statement”). The Issuer shall, as soon as practicable, but not later than ________, 2024, deliver to the Underwriter as many printed, conformed copies of the Official Statement as the Underwriter shall advise the Issuer are necessary to permit the Underwriter to comply with the requirements of Rule 15c2-12 and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”). In addition, the Issuer will provide, subject to customary disclaimers regarding the transmission of electronic copies, an electronic copy of the final Official Statement to the Underwriter in the currently required designated electronic format stated in MSRB Rule G-32 and the EMMA Dataport Manual (as defined below). The format in which the Preliminary Official Statement was delivered meets such electronic form requirements.

Within one (1) business day after receipt of the Official Statement from the Issuer, but no later than the date of Closing, the Underwriter shall, at its own expense, submit the Official Statement to EMMA (as defined below). The Underwriter shall comply with the provisions of MSRB Rule G-32, including without limitation the submission of Form G-32 and the Official Statement, and notify the Issuer of the date on which the Official Statement has been filed with EMMA.

“EMMA” means the MSRB’s Electronic Municipal Market Access system, or any other electronic municipal securities information access system designated by the MSRB for collecting and disseminating primary offering documents and information.
<!-- Page 724 -->
“EMMA Dataport Manual” means the document(s) designated as such and published by the MSRB from time to time setting forth the processes and procedures with respect to submissions to be made to the primary market disclosure service of EMMA by underwriters under Rule G-32(b).

(c) Each party hereto agrees that it will notify the other parties hereto if, within the period from the date of this Purchase Contract to and including the date which is 25 days following the End of the Underwriting Period (defined below), such party discovers any pre-existing or subsequent fact or becomes aware of the occurrence of any event, in any such case, which might cause the Official Statement (as the same may have been supplemented or amended) to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. If, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriter, the preparation and publication of a supplement or amendment to the Official Statement is, as a result of such fact or event (or any other event which becomes known to the Issuer or the Underwriter during such period), necessary so that the Official Statement does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and furnish a sufficient number of copies of such supplement or amendment to the Underwriter as is required for the Underwriter to comply with its obligations imposed by the SEC and the MSRB. The Issuer and the Underwriter agree that they will cooperate in the preparation of any such amendment or supplement. The Issuer agrees that it will not prepare, publish or distribute any supplement or amendment to the Official Statement without the consent of the Underwriter.

(d) For purposes of this Purchase Contract, the “End of the Underwriting Period” shall mean the Closing Date (defined below), or, if the Issuer has been notified in writing by the Underwriter, on or prior to the Closing Date, that the “End of the Underwriting Period” within the meaning of Rule 15c2-12 will not occur on the Closing Date, such later day on which the “End of the Underwriting Period” within such meaning has in fact occurred. If the Issuer has been given notice pursuant to the preceding sentence that the “End of the Underwriting Period” will not occur on the Closing Date, the Underwriter agrees to notify the Issuer in writing of the day it does occur as soon as practicable following the “End of the Underwriting Period” for all purposes of Rule 15c2-12; provided, however, that if the Underwriter has not otherwise so notified the Issuer of the “End of the Underwriting Period” by the 180th day after the Closing Date, then the “End of the Underwriting Period” shall be deemed to occur on such 180th day after the Closing Date, unless otherwise agreed to by the Issuer.

(e) At any time prior to the End of the Underwriting Period, the Underwriter may from time to time request, and, if such request is made, the Issuer shall deliver to the Underwriter as soon as practicable thereafter, a certificate of the Issuer signed by an Authorized Officer in the form set forth as Exhibit E hereto, dated a date (and speaking as of such date) not earlier than the -3-

-15-
<!-- Page 737 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

interests that differ from those of the Issuer; (ii) the Underwriter is not acting as a municipal advisor, financial advisor, or fiduciary to the Issuer and has not assumed any advisory or fiduciary responsibility to the Issuer with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby and the discussions, undertakings and procedures leading thereto (irrespective of whether the Underwriter has provided other services or is currently providing other services to the Issuer on other matters); (iii) the only obligations the Underwriter has to the Issuer with respect to the transaction contemplated hereby expressly are set forth in this Purchase Contract, provided that nothing in this Purchase Contract shall be construed to limit the Underwriter’s obligation of fair dealing under MSRB Rule G-17; and (iv) the Issuer has consulted its own financial and/or municipal, legal, accounting, tax and other advisors, as applicable, to the extent it deems appropriate.

SECTION 12. ESTABLISHMENT OF PRICE.

(a) The Underwriter agrees to assist the Issuer in establishing the issue price of the Bonds and shall execute and deliver to the Issuer at Closing an “issue price” or similar certificate, together with the supporting pricing wires or equivalent communications, in such form as may be appropriate or necessary, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriter, the Issuer and Bond Counsel, to accurately reflect, as applicable, the sales price or prices or the initial offering price or prices to the public of the Bonds. All actions to be taken by the Issuer under this section to establish the issue price of the Bonds may be taken on behalf of the Issuer by PFM and any notice or report to be provided to the Issuer may be provided to PFM.

(b) The Issuer will treat the first price at which 10% of each maturity of the Bonds (the “10% test”) is sold to the public as the issue price of that maturity (if different interest rates apply within a maturity, each separate CUSIP number within that maturity will be subject to the 10% test).

**FORM OF SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL**

[Closing Date], 2024  
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC  
New York, New York  

Northern California Energy Authority  
Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024  
(Supplemental Opinion)  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This letter is addressed to you, as Underwriter, pursuant to Section 8(e)(11) of the Bond Purchase Contract, dated [Pricing Date], 2024 (the “Purchase Contract”), between you and the Northern California Energy Authority (the “Issuer”), providing for the purchase of $000,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Northern California Energy Authority Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”). The Bonds are being issued pursuant to an amended and restated trust indenture, dated as of [____] 1, 2024 (the “Trust Indenture”), between the Issuer and Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Trust Indenture or, if not defined in the Trust Indenture, in the Purchase Contract.

We have delivered our final legal opinion (the “Bond Opinion”) as bond counsel to the Issuer concerning the validity of the Bonds and certain other matters, dated the date hereof and addressed to the Issuer. You may rely on such opinion as though the same were addressed to you.

In connection with our role as bond counsel to the Issuer, we have reviewed the Purchase Contract; the Trust Indenture; the Commodity Purchase Agreement; the Commodity Supply Contract; the Tax Certificate and Agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”), between the Issuer and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”); certain portions of the preliminary official statement of the Issuer, dated ____, 2024, with respect to the Bonds (the “Preliminary Official Statement”) and of the official statement of the Issuer, dated [Pricing Date], 2024, with respect to the Bonds (the “Official Statement”); opinions of counsel to the Issuer, the Trustee and SMUD; certificates of the Issuer, the Trustee, SMUD and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to provide the opinions or conclusions set forth herein.

The opinions and conclusions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions or conclusions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after the date hereof. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures.

Presented to us (whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than the Issuer. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to in the third paragraph hereof. We have further assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in such documents. In addition, we call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Bonds, the Trust Indenture, the Commodity Purchase Agreement, the Commodity Supply Contract, the Tax Certificate and the Purchase Contract and their enforceability may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against joint powers authorities and municipal utility districts in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinions with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the assets described in or subject to the lien of the Trust Indenture or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein of, or the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such assets. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, except as expressly set forth in numbered paragraph 2 below, completeness or fairness of the Official Statement or other offering material relating to the Bonds and express no opinion relating thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions or conclusions:

1. The Purchase Contract has been duly executed and delivered by, and is a valid and binding agreement of, the Issuer.

2. The statements contained in the Official Statement under the captions “INTRODUCTION – The Bonds,” “- Security for the Bonds” and “- Debt Service and Commodity Swap Reserves;” “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS;” “THE BONDS;” “TAX MATTERS;” “APPENDIX C – DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN TERMS” (to the extent such information relates to the Indenture); “APPENDIX D – SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE INDENTURE,” and “APPENDIX F – PROPOSED FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL;” excluding any material that may be treated as included under such captions by cross-reference or references to other documents or sources, insofar as such statements expressly summarize certain provisions of the Indenture and the form and content of our Bond Opinion are accurate in all material respects.

3. We are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy (except as explicitly stated in paragraph 2 above), completeness or fairness of any of the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement or in the Official Statement and make no representation that we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of any such statements. We do not assume any responsibility for any electronic version of the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement, and assume that any such version is identical in all respects to the printed version.

**FORM OF OPINION OF GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE ISSUER**

[Closing Date], 2024

To the Addressees on  
Schedule I attached hereto

I have acted as general counsel to Northern California Energy Authority (the “Issuer”) in connection with its issuance of $000,000,000 Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024 (the “Bonds”). This opinion is rendered pursuant to Section 8(e)(12) of the Bond Purchase Contract, dated [Pricing Date], 2024 (the “Bond Purchase Contract”), by and between Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (the “Underwriter”) and the Issuer. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this opinion shall have the same meanings assigned to them in the Bond Purchase Contract.

In rendering this opinion, I have examined originals or copies satisfactory to me of such records and other documents as I have deemed necessary and relevant as a basis for the opinions hereinafter expressed. In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as originals, and the conformity of all original documents submitted to me as copies.

In giving the opinions expressed below I do not purport to be expert in or generally familiar with or qualified to express legal opinions based on the laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of California (the “State”).

As to factual matters, I have relied solely upon the documents described herein, the representations and warranties of the Issuer contained in the Issuer Documents, the Preliminary Official Statement, the Official Statement, the JPA Agreement of the Issuer and various certificates and other documents furnished to me by Issuer’s officers and its Commission. In basing the opinions set forth in this letter on “my knowledge,” the words “my knowledge” signify that, in the course of my representation of the Issuer in connection with the issuance of the Bonds, no facts have come to my attention that would give me actual knowledge or actual notice that any such opinions or other matters are not accurate. Except as otherwise stated in this opinion, I have undertaken no investigation or verification of such matters.

Based upon the foregoing examination and review, I am of the opinion that:

1. The Issuer is a joint powers authority and public entity of the State of California, organized and existing pursuant to the provisions of the Joint Exercise of Powers Act, constituting Chapter 5 of Division 7 of Title 1 (commencing with Section 6500) of the California Government Code, as amended and supplemented (the

B-1
<!-- Page 747 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image) 

“Act”), and a joint powers agreement, dated November 8, 2018 (the “JPA Agreement”), entered into between the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority, and has full legal right, power and authority under the Act and the JPA Agreement to (a) adopt the bond resolution adopted by it on __________, 2024 (the “Bond Resolution”), (b) execute and deliver the Official Statement, (c) enter into, execute and deliver the Issuer Documents, (d) sell, issue and deliver the Bonds to the Underwriter, and (e) carry out and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Issuer Documents and the Official Statement, and the Issuer has complied, and will at the Closing be in compliance in all respects, with the terms of the Act, the JPA Agreement and the Issuer Documents as they pertain to such transactions.

2. By all necessary official action, the Issuer has duly authorized all necessary action to be taken by it for (a) the adoption of the Bond Resolution, (b) the issuance and sale of the Bonds, (c) the approval, execution and delivery of, and the performance by the Issuer of the obligations on its part, contained in the Bonds and the Issuer Documents, and (d) the consummation by it of all other transactions contemplated by the Official Statement and the Issuer Documents.

3. The Bond Resolution was duly and validly adopted by the Issuer and all other proceedings pertinent to the validity and enforceability of the Bonds have been duly and validly adopted or undertaken in compliance with all applicable procedural requirements of the Issuer and in compliance with the Constitution and laws of the State, including the Act and the JPA Agreement, and the Bond Resolution is in full force and effect and has not been amended.

4. The Issuer Documents have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Issuer, and constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer enforceable against the Issuer in accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar laws and equitable principles of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against public entities in the State; and the Bonds, when issued, delivered and paid for, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Issuer entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and are enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other similar laws and principles of equity relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against public entities in the State; and upon the issuance, authentication and delivery of the Bonds as aforesaid, the Indenture will provide, for the benefit of the holders, from time to time of the Bonds and the Commodity Swap Counterparty the legally valid and binding pledge of and lien it purports to create as set forth therein.

5. The distribution of the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement has been duly authorized by the Issuer.

B-2
<!-- Page 748 -->
6. All authorizations, approvals, licenses, permits, consents and orders of any governmental authority, legislative body, board, agency or commission having jurisdiction of the matter which are required for the due authorization of, which would constitute a condition precedent to, or the absence of which would materially adversely affect the due performance by the Issuer of its obligations under the Issuer Documents and the Bonds have been obtained.

7. To my knowledge as general counsel of the Issuer since its inception, there is no legislation, action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at law or in equity, before or by any court, government agency, public board or body, pending or, to my knowledge, threatened against the Issuer, affecting the existence of the Issuer or the titles of its officers to their respective offices, or affecting or seeking to prohibit, restrain or enjoin the sale, issuance or delivery of the Bonds or the collection of the Revenues (as defined in the Indenture) pursuant to the Bond Resolution or the Indenture or in any way contesting or affecting the validity or enforceability of the Bonds or the Issuer Documents, or contesting the exclusion from gross income of interest on the Bonds for federal income tax purposes or contesting in any way the completeness or accuracy of the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement or any supplement or amendment thereto, or contesting the powers of the Issuer or any authority for the issuance of the Bonds, the adoption of the Bond Resolution or the execution and delivery of the Issuer Documents, nor, to my knowledge, is there any basis therefor, wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Issuer Documents.

8. The execution and delivery of the Issuer Documents and compliance by the Issuer with the provisions thereof, under the circumstances contemplated herein and therein, will not conflict with or constitute on the part of the Issuer a material breach of or a default under any agreement or instrument to which the Issuer is a party, or violate any existing law, administrative regulation, court order, or consent decree to which the Issuer is subject.

9. To my knowledge, the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement under the captions “NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ENERGY AUTHORITY,” “CONTINUING DISCLOSURE” and “LITIGATION” are true and accurate in all material respects.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, the foregoing opinion is expressly made subject to the following exceptions, qualifications, and assumptions:

(i) I express no opinion with respect to the validity or enforceability of any provisions of the Issuer Documents or any other documents concerning any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, or severability provisions contained therein.

B-3
<!-- Page 749 -->
(ii) I express no opinion as to the enforceability of provisions waiving, directly or indirectly, expressly or impliedly, defenses to obligations or rights granted by law, where such waivers are prohibited by law or are against public policy.

(iii) I except from my opinion any provisions contained in any document which purport to prevent any party from raising an affirmative defense thereto, such as estoppel, illegality, etc., if such affirmative defense arises or is asserted to have arisen out of any action by any party which has not been brought to my attention, or which purports to prevent any party from raising a claim of fraud.

(iv) I except from my opinion any provisions contained in any of the documents which could be construed as waiving service of process or any applicable statute of limitations defense or which establish any rights to specific performance.

(v) My opinion as to enforceability is limited by standards of good faith, fair dealing, materiality, and reasonableness that may be applied by a court to the exercise of certain rights and remedies; limitations based on statutes or on public policy limiting a person’s right to waive the benefit of statutory provisions or of a common law right; and limitations releasing a party from or indemnifying a party against liability for its own wrongful or negligent act when such release or indemnification is contrary to public policy.

(vi) My opinion is limited to the matters stated herein and no opinion may be inferred or implied beyond the matters expressly stated herein. The opinions expressed in this letter are given solely for your use and benefit in connection with the transactions referred to herein and no other person may use or rely on this opinion letter, nor may it be used, relied upon or circulated or quoted in relation to any other transaction which is not related to transactions referred to herein, without my prior express written consent. This opinion is provided to you as a legal opinion only and not as a warranty or guarantee with respect to the matter described herein or in the documents referred to herein.

(vii) The scope of this opinion is limited to those issues and parties specifically considered herein and no further or more expansive opinion is implied or should be inferred from any opinion expressed herein. On such basis, any variation or difference in the facts upon which this opinion is based might affect my conclusions in an adverse manner and make them inaccurate.

Respectfully submitted,
