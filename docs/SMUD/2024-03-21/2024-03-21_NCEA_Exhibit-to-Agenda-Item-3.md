# Commodity Prepay Summary

- In 2018 Bonds were issued the Northern California Energy Authority (NCEA), to prepay for a 30-year supply of commodities  
  ➤ $0.48/dekatherm discount = $3 million annual commodity savings from 2019-2023

- The 2018 prepay bonds require repricing by July 2024  
  ➤ NCEA plans to issue up to $800 million of similar bonds this spring for a 6-year term that optimizes the savings that SMUD receives

- Current pricing indicates SMUD will save $3+ million annually on commodity costs from a $0.50-0.55/dekatherm discount
