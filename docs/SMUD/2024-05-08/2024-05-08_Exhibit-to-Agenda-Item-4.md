**Comments:**

- We should clarify this: “material amount of staff time”.

- Didn’t we change the language on this with Eric Douglas in our last retreat? I liked the changes we suggested then and maybe we just need to approve now?

- I remain somewhat uncomfortable with the definitive nature of the word “must” paired with the ambiguity of “in their opinion” and “material.” Given today’s staff and Board, it’s not an issue, and if it became one in the future, the individual Board member would just have to get three colleagues to agree with the request…..
