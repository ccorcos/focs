**Maintaining the public trust and confidence in the integrity and ethical conduct of the Board and SMUD employees is a core value. Therefore, to ensure the public interest is paramount in all official conduct, the Board shall adopt and update, as necessary: a Conflict of Interest Code as required by State law. SMUD shall also maintain and enforce a code of conduct applicable to all employees.**

**Among other things the code of conduct shall:**

a) Require high ethical standards in all aspects of official conduct;  
b) Establish clear guidelines for ethical standards and conduct by setting forth those acts that may be incompatible with the best interests of SMUD and the public;  
c) Require disclosure and reporting of potential conflicts of interest; and  
d) Provide a process for (i) reporting suspected violations of the code of conduct and policies through multiple channels, including an anonymous hotline, and (ii) investigating suspected violations.
