![Rationale for Updates to BL 10](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1365.png?text=Rationale+for+Updates+to+BL+10)

1. The existing policy language requires Board action for relatively low financial value real property acquisitions when the negotiated sale price is more than 15% above appraised value. The proposed edit would grant flexibility to staff to close deals when the purchase price is no more than $150,000 over 115% of the appraised value of the real property.

2. There is no existing delegation to staff to acquire option agreements. Options are a useful means of keeping real property off the market while securing access so we can conduct due diligence as to property condition and suitability for development.
