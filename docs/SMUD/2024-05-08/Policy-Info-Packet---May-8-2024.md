# Board Monitoring Report
## 2023 SD-8, Employee Relations

### 1. Background
Strategic Direction 8 (SD-8) states that:

Developing and maintaining a high quality, diverse and inclusive workplace that engages and inspires employees to commit to SMUD’s purpose, vision and values is a core value of SMUD.

SMUD is committed to diversity and inclusion and will foster and support a workplace that values employees representing a variety of backgrounds, including but not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender, gender identification and/or expression, sexual orientation and identification, national origin, age, physical abilities, veteran status, socio-economic status, life experiences, talents, and thinking styles.

Therefore:
a) SMUD shall attract and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce.  
b) SMUD shall promote inclusion and diversity and engage its workforce in activities that demonstrate and support inclusion and diversity across the organization.  
c) SMUD shall engage its workforce in personal and professional development.  
d) SMUD’s percentage of engaged employees as measured through the Engagement Index shall exceed 80%.  
e) SMUD shall use a broad mix of communication and outreach channels to ensure its recruitment activities reflect the diversity of the communities it serves.  
f) SMUD shall maintain and communicate written policies that define procedures and expectations for staff and provide for effective handling of grievances.  
g) Annually, and consistent with State and Federal law, the Board shall receive a report detailing the demographics and trends of the SMUD workforce, the available workforce, and the Sacramento region. The report shall also provide information on veterans as a part of SMUD’s workforce.

### 2. Executive Summary
SMUD is in full compliance with SD-8, Employee Relations.

The rapid pace of change in today’s energy industry and economy requires that employer workforce strategies shift in kind. SMUD has accordingly accelerated the rate at which we implement changes to how we attract, retain, engage, and develop our employees. After several years enhancing people strategies with better data and stronger partnerships, the 2023 outcomes in this report will illustrate early signs of the building momentum we’re experiencing within our programs.

Please see attached Appendix for additional information related to the SD-8 metrics.  

4. Challenges  
As we continue to enhance our programs, we must consider impacts to bandwidth, program service level, and resource allocation so as not to impair employee engagement, customer experience, or our robust organizational culture. We’re mitigating these risks with an increased focus on cross-functional collaboration, improving the awareness of neighboring projects and appropriately committing resources.  

While improved data, tools, and planning are enhancing the line of sight into our changing workforce composition and we are beginning to note shifts, changes to our workforce make-up and future skill requirements will require a significant investment of time. We suspect tomorrow’s workforce won’t look entirely different from today’s. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the labor force is growing more slowly than in previous decades and remaining in the workforce longer.  

These trends, SMUD’s historically low employee turnover, and the realities of a fast-changing energy industry and economy indicate the need for a careful investment in both current and future priorities. As we continue to adapt, our goal is sustainable progress.  

5. Recommendations  
As reflected in this report, SMUD has achieved the goals set forth in SD-8 for ensuring SMUD develops and maintains a high quality, inclusive workplace that engages and inspires employees to commit to SMUD’s purpose, vision, and values.  

It is recommended the Board accept the monitoring report for Strategic Direction 8.

**Appendix**

**Recruitment**  
The Talent Acquisition team tackled an unprecedented workload in 2023, managing 801 hiring requisitions and screening almost 30,000 applications. External applications more than doubled from just under 12,500 applicants in 2022 to just over 25,000 in 2023! While this increase can be attributed to several multi-year efforts across SMUD and the region, we suspect a large portion of this success is due to our recruiters’ smart use of Circa - the third-party software solution we acquired in 2022.

In addition to traditional email blasts, job board postings, social media ads, and internal employee communication channels; we can now affordably and efficiently advertise jobs to partners, schools, and community organizations within a 150-mile radius via the Circa platform. We’re already noticing impacts to the diversity of our applicant pools thanks to this strategic technological investment. A marked increase in communities of color and females can be seen in the chart below.

**Applicant Demographics 2022 v 2023**

| Demographics          | % of Total Applicants in 2022 | % of Total Applicants in 2023 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|

Recruiters conducted more than 400 consultations with SMUD’s hiring managers last year to ensure a shared understanding of candidate qualifications. These interactions facilitated education to support transparency and consistency across the organization, mitigating potential for bias within the selection process.

Additionally, the Talent Acquisition team completed a series of efforts in 2023 to improve equitable access to job opportunities. These included:
- A “Brass Tacks” workshop to support internal career mobility at SMUD where employees learned about the gears that keep the hiring process moving (eligibility lists, job descriptions, the selection process, and more).
- A series of resume workshops to educate employees about screening requirements and stand-out application materials.
- Enhanced candidate support for job classifications that historically receive a high volume of applicants. Recruiters ensured improved access to these opportunities via timely and succinct social media announcements about resources, important dates, and capped application requirements.

**GM 24-073 SD-8, Employee Relations Board Monitoring Report Page 6 of 15**
<!-- Page 13 -->
- A collaboration with the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) Council and Subcommittees to establish Diverse Hiring Panel guidelines. These guidelines ensure interview panels at SMUD are both representative of, and educated in, the diversity of our organization and community.

## Early Talent Programs
Alongside Toyota, Paramount, Fox Corporation, and Intuit, SMUD was recognized by Interns2Pros in 2023 as a top 5 finalist for Internship Program of the Year. Here’s a sampling of the accomplishments that made this possible:
- We touched 34 college and university events reaching nearly 3,000 students.
- We increased face-to-face interactions with diverse college populations like career centers, clubs, and student groups.
- We redesigned existing internship workshops and events to better meet the needs of our university partners. One example: the Talent Acquisition team designed and delivered a workshop titled “Through the Eyes of a Recruiter” to UC Davis, Sac State, Chico, Los Rios College District, UOP, and Sierra College to educate students on SMUD’s selection processes. To complement the training, they also provided student coaching on resume building and behavior-based interviewing.
- We experienced a 50% increase in college applicants for the summer intern program. More than 1,400 students from diverse backgrounds competed for 25 coveted spots.
- Those accepted tackled a variety of important initiatives, including contributions to biological field surveys for endangered species in SMUD’s Upper American River Project; cybersecurity tasks and help desk tickets; and support for SMUD Cares.
- We also increased our on-site programming for interns, hosting numerous financial wellness workshops, coffee with executives, two Habitat for Humanity volunteer events, and a tour of the Sacramento Power Academy.

The Early Talent Programs team also administers two annual community scholarships:
- **Powering Futures**  
  21 scholarships were awarded in 2023, ranging from $2,000 for community college students to $4,000 for 4-year university students. Those with a demonstrated financial need pursuing majors related to careers at SMUD received preference.
  
- **Powering Aggies and Powering Hornets**  
  These scholarship programs were established in 2018 to benefit 1 student each from UC Davis and Sac State. Eligible students who majored in a SMUD-related career field at UC Davis or electrical engineering at Sac State were selected by their respective universities. In 2023, the Powering Aggies winner was awarded $1,800 and the Powering Hornets winner $2,500.

## Employee Onboarding
New Employee Orientation (NEO) is SMUD’s first opportunity to engage its employees. We refreshed this program in 2023 by returning to an in-person format and switching from a weekly to a bi-weekly cadence for improved class sizes and labor efficiencies. The money and time saved was reallocated to support additional program enhancements like sponsored cohort lunches, campus tours, and post-NEO check-ins. We recognize that continued communication with these employees is critical to making sure they feel supported and seen as newcomers to our workforce.

![Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging (DEIB)](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging (DEIB)**  
The DEIB team drove improved structure and accountability in 2023, bolstering important work supporting trust, respect, and inclusion at SMUD. In January, they launched an official handbook to support the organization in creating, growing, and sustainably managing Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). The book includes templates and guidance on everything from budget and governance structures to cross-collaboration and metrics. ERGs are currently working to establish baseline data on topics such as representation, allyship, and participation. We’re looking forward to gleaning additional insight about our workforce with the help of these measures.

**SMUD’s 8 ERGs include:**  
- Black Employee Resource Group (BERG)  
- Asian Pacific Islander (GRAIN ERG)  
- Latinos Unity Network for Action (LUNA)  
- Military Employee Resource Group (MERG)  
- People Reaffirming Inclusion Diversity and Equality (PRIDE)  
- Women’s Employee Resource Group (WERG)  
- Young Professionals Employee Resource Group (YP)  
- Parents ERG  

Established in 2022, the DEIB Council is comprised of a group of employees across the enterprise acting on behalf of the SMUD to support DEIB initiatives. The Council advises, advocates for, informs, assesses and/or monitors the DEIB strategic plan, as well as provides recommendations to the DEIB Department on behalf of SMUD.

Additional structural enhancements were made to SMUD’s DEIB Council, whose role is to advise, advocate for, inform, assess and/or monitor the DEIB strategic process. Through the establishment of its four subcommittees in 2023, (Diverse Workforce, Inclusive Culture, Community Impact, and Equity), the council is now equipped to provide resources and recommendations to the Workforce, Diversity & Enterprise Partnerships group and DEIB team.

**Workforce Culture**  
SMUD’s most recent organizational commitments to a culture of inclusion were documented in our 2023 Inclusive Culture Implementation Plan. The first of two goals was to foster the norms and values of an inclusive culture within our core competencies. Last updated in 2017, we worked with executives and senior leaders to identify refreshed competencies reflecting the skills and behaviors needed to execute on our 2030 Clean Energy Vision. We added the competencies Values Differences and Instills Trust—both key components of inclusion.

The second goal in the 2023 Inclusive Culture Implementation Plan was to prioritize employee growth and development. We focused on a 5% increase in utilization of four key learning programs last year, and the numbers in the table on Page 4 of this report show the extent to which we exceeded this goal for all programs.

Our 2021 engagement results showed “My work gives me opportunities to learn and grow” is one of four questions that are strong drivers of engagement based on statistical analysis. While our last survey indicated that 73% of employees agree with this question, that score is 7% below the global average for our vendor. We look forward to revisiting this question with our workforce when we next survey them in fall of 2024.

**Corporate Learning**  
There are several indicators that SMUD employees are deepening their relationship to learning.  
- Employee mandatory training accounted for an average of 25 hours per person in 2023, but employees also averaged 45 hours of non-mandatory training.  
- 1,044 employees leveraged the LinkedIn Learning platform and completed courses totaling more than 2,917 hours. Unique users increased by 39%!  
- We also saw increased participation across several learning and development programs:

| Program                     | 2022                     | 2023                     | % Increase |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Learning at SMUD           | Annual program of employee-led learning | 2,458 participants | 3,236 participants | 32%        |
| Mentoring Program           | Relationship building for continued career success | 32 mentor/ mentee pairs | 58 mentor/ mentee pairs | 81%        |
| Field Employee Learning     | In-person training offered by Sacramento Power Academy | 100 participants | 146 participants | 46%        |

**Leadership Development**  
To provide experiential learning opportunities that develop leadership, and support collaboration and philanthropy in the community, SMUD currently supports 9 different leadership programs: Nehemiah Emerging Leaders, WEI Business Acumen for Emerging Leaders, Asian Pacific Chamber Catalyst program, Leadership Rancho Cordova program, Leadership Elk Grove, Leadership Sacramento, Creciente Leadership Program (formerly Nueva Epoca), Leadership Folsom, and SMUD’s Building Leadership Talent program. A selection process is conducted annually to match applicants with a program that effectively meets their development needs and SMUD’s business objectives, and individuals that sit on selection panels are required to complete unconscious bias training.

**Wellness**  
Our goal at SMUD is to create an environment where wellness is seamlessly integrated into our corporate culture, contributing to the overall success of our organization and the satisfaction of our employees. Health and wellness program participation increased by 4%, with 365 participants in 2023 compared to 351 in 2022. We continue to enhance our strategy with flexible programs supporting several aspects of social, mental, physical, and financial wellness.

- We implemented One SMUD Stroll – a scheduled walking event with SMUD’s Chief Diversity Officer where colleagues can casually convene, connect and converse with peers and members of SMUD’s leadership team at Headquarters and the East Campus Operations Center.
- ERGs sponsored 7 health and wellness-themed events throughout the year, including:
  - “Mental Health Awareness: Take care of you first so you can help take care of others”, a workshop hosted by the Parents ERG; and
  - “Stress Management through Bhagavad-Gita”, a South Asian Heritage Month event sponsored by the GRAIN ERG to share how spiritual teachings can help reduce stress.
- We re-introduced the employee vanpool program and on-site fitness centers, which were both suspended post-pandemic. Championing the needs of our hybrid workforce and commitment to financial prudence, we updated the operating models for both:
  - For $130/month via pre-tax payroll deduction, employees can join SMUD’s new vanpool program in partnership with Enterprise, which provides transportation to and from designated stops; participation in the Commute with Enterprise Guaranteed Ride Home Program; insurance through Commute with Enterprise; and roadside assistance.
  - Fitness Centers at both the Customer Service Center and East Campus Operations Center are now open with non-supervised, full access to equipment. Employees were previously charged a membership fee to offset the cost of staffing, but centers are now free for all full-time, part-time, limited-term and casual employees to use after completing a 10-minute orientation video and a release of liability waiver.

**Benefits**  
Our transition to a post-pandemic hybrid work culture ramped up in 2023 with enhanced policy and decision making. The Enterprise Culture & Change team conducted extensive research on remote work best practices, analysis of employee location data, outreach to over 40 Western Energy Institute members, and focus groups with SMUD’s directors to understand how remote work was functioning. SMUD executive leadership ultimately arrived at the decision that all employees would spend a minimum of 1 day per pay period onsite beginning in Q1 of 2024.

To make this possible, we updated SMUD’s remote work policy, planned for the space needs of approximately 400 previously fully remote employees, and sponsored brown bag lunches and training to communicate changes and expectations about the remote work benefit. As a hybrid organization, our goal is to intentionally promote in-person connections that build relationships and trust while continuing to enable employees to work remotely for part of their schedule. This hybrid approach provides flexibility that can be an important part of work-life balance.

Other post-pandemic considerations in 2023 included a full return to office for in-person open enrollment – the first since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Employees and retirees had the option to meet with the Benefits teams in-person or virtually, or to continue using the Virtual Benefit Fair platform featuring guidebooks, plan summary documents, and the ability to send questions to our benefit providers. Staff also arranged for vendors to present on coverage options for each of their plans.

Two additional noteworthy accomplishments:
- We conducted 2 pre-retirement seminars to packed rooms in 2023. Pre-COVID attendance hovered around 30-40 people. We saw close to 90 attendees at both pre-retirement seminars last year, helping to reengage those who were previously unable to leverage technology.
- For another consecutive year, we negotiated an impressive medical renewal under 5% compared to the industry standard of 7%. Our staff remains committed to addressing the rising cost of health care.

Conduct & Grievances  
In addition to SMUD’s Code of Business Ethics and Employee Conduct, the Employee and Labor Relations teams provide daily guidance and counsel to ensure all employees (represented and unrepresented) understand SMUD policies and procedures, and their responsibilities with respect to the Code of Ethics. The teams resolved a total of 9 grievances in 2023, down from 11 in 2022.

SMUD Workforce Demographics  
The following chart provides demographic information about SMUD’s workforce (excluding “casual” positions and members of the Board of Directors). A thorough analysis of this data resulted in the following findings for 2023:
- A 0.6% increase in Hispanic employees
- A 0.4% increase in Asian employees
- A continued downward trend in the percentage of Caucasian employees

The cumulative impact of enhancements to our employee programs and organic turnover are the likely drivers for this change as SMUD continues to develop its talent pipeline and build a workforce that reflects the diversity of the communities we serve.

**SMUD’s Veteran Workforce**
Veterans are a small but important part of SMUD’s workforce, and in 2023, we attended 11 vet-specific events to help with tools to enter civilian careers. This included California Employment Development Department’s VetNet Series, Sacramento Veteran Employee Resource Groups, and Volunteers of America, where we assisted with mock interviews, resume workshops, hiring process questions, and information about SMUD programs.

We leveraged the Circa platform to complete outreach to 563 veteran organizations last year, sending more than 6,000 email announcements about SMUD jobs, and saw a 20% increase in veteran applicants (540 in 2023 compared to 434 in 2022). We ultimately hired 12 veterans, and SMUD’s vet population increased from 4.5% in 2022 to 5.2% in 2023. Per the Biddle Consulting Group, 6.7% is the national percentage of veterans in the civilian labor force.

**SMUD Workforce Demographics by Employee Level**

When compared to 2022 data, we saw an increase in female directors, supervisors, and staff at SMUD last year. This trend, combined with the increase in female applicants reported on page 6, indicate our targeted efforts to improve female representation are working.

| Employee Level | Male | Female |
|----------------|------|--------|
| Executives      | 60%  | 40%    |
| Directors       | 57%  | 43%    |
| Managers        | 64%  | 36%    |
| Supervisors     | 62%  | 38%    |
| Staff           | 66%  | 34%    |

Additional shifts in demographics by employee level for 2023 include increases in:
- African American executives, directors, managers, and supervisors
- Hispanic directors, managers, and supervisors
- Asian directors and supervisors
- Directors and supervisors of two or more races

As a note, this reporting remains dynamic in the sense that all demographics are self-reported and, while uncommon, employees can change their gender identity or ethnicity at any time.

* Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.

**Workforce Turnover**  
SMUD’s turnover decreased in 2023 from 7.0% in 2022 to 6.4%, which we believe to be in large part due to fewer retirements. Retirements decreased from 78 in 2022 to 63 retirements last year. Our turnover continues to rank below the industry benchmark of 11.1%. While SMUD’s Baby Boomer workforce is entering retirement eligibility, economic influences are also affecting the average length of time a person may choose to stay in the workforce.

**Completing the Employee Lifecycle**  
To help identify strengths and opportunities across the organization, we introduced voluntary voice-to-voice exit interviews for departing employees in 2023. In the first year of the program, 88 employees elected to share feedback on their experiences at SMUD.

- 94% of all exiting employees would recommend SMUD to a friend or colleague.
- 90% of exiting employees would consider returning to SMUD if the conditions were right.
- Less than half of employees specified that they were leaving because they were dissatisfied with some part of their job - either promotional opportunities, remote work limitations, or work/life balance in their specific job.
- Most employees view the people they worked with at SMUD as the best part of their job and listed a substantial number of positive descriptors for them.
- Employees felt recognized and appreciated for the contributions they made to SMUD. There were many more positive reactions when asked this question than critical commentary.

There is a strong correlation with the information discovered through the exit interview process and SMUD’s engagement survey data, which senior leaders have been actively addressing since developing engagement action plans in 2022.

![SMUD Separation History](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=SMUD+Separation+History)

The 2023 separation data tells us that Caucasian employees represented 63% of departing employees, up from 60% in 2022. This shift was offset by an increase of 4% for Hispanic employees, a 5% decrease for Asian employees, and a 2% decrease for employees of two or more races. While we did see fewer employees leave SMUD in 2023 overall, we’re continuing to conduct a deeper analysis of this data to learn if correlations exist between specific populations and exit interview feedback.

**DATE:** April 24, 2024  

**FROM:** Claire Rogers CR 4/24/24  

**SUBJECT:** Audit Report No. 28007744  
Board Monitoring Report; SD-12: Ethics  

Internal Audit Services (IAS) received the SD-12 Ethics 2023 Annual Board Monitoring Report and performed the following:  

- Selected a sample of statements and assertions in the report for review.  
- Interviewed report contributors and verified the methodology used to prepare the statements in our sample.  
- Validated the reasonableness of the statements in our sample based on the data or other support provided to us.  

During the review, nothing came to IAS’ attention that would suggest the items sampled within the SD Board Monitoring report did not fairly represent the source data available at the time of the review.

# Board Monitoring Report 2023  
## SD-12, Ethics  

1. **Background**  

   Strategic Direction 12 states that:  

   Maintaining the public trust and confidence in the integrity and ethical conduct of the Board and SMUD employees is a core value. Therefore, to ensure the public interest is paramount in all official conduct, the Board shall adopt and update, as necessary: a Conflict of Interest Code as required by State law. SMUD shall also maintain and enforce a code of conduct applicable to all employees.  

   Among other things the code of conduct shall:  
   a) Require high ethical standards in all aspects of official conduct;  
   b) Establish clear guidelines for ethical standards and conduct by setting forth those acts that may be incompatible with the best interests of SMUD and the public;  
   c) Require disclosure and reporting of potential conflicts of interest; and  
   d) Provide a process for (i) reporting suspected violations of the code of conduct and policies through multiple channels, including an anonymous hotline, and (ii) investigating suspected violations.  

2. **Executive Summary**  

   SMUD is in compliance with the requirements of SD-12.  

   Strategic Direction 12 requires SMUD to have a process to report potential conflicts of interest and a process for reporting and investigating suspected violations of the Code of Conduct. Compliance is foundational for acting in the best interests of our customers and community. Several SMUD policies and procedures support the requirement of high ethical standards in all aspects of official conduct.  

   | SD Requirement | Supporting Process/Procedure |  
   |----------------|------------------------------|  
   | a) Require high ethical standards | SMUD's Ethics policy (AP 05.02.03) sets the requirements and expectations for ethical behavior, including communication, training and other resources. |  

GM 24-074  
SD-12, Ethics Board Monitoring Report  
Page 1 of 5  
<!-- Page 26 -->
b) Establish clear guidelines for ethical standards and conduct  
SMUD’s Code of Business Ethics and Employee Conduct were updated and approved by the CEO & General Manager in 2020. SMUD’s Ethics procedure (MP 05.02.03.100) was adopted in 2008 and updated in January 2021. SMUD’s Conflict of Interest policy (AP 05.02.02) was adopted in 1998 and approved by the FPPC (Fair Political Practices Commission) in 2023.

c) Require disclosure and reporting potential conflicts of interest statements  
Notice of filing requirements were sent to employees as early as January and through March. 97.7% of the annual conflict of interest statements were received by the time this report was finalized.

d) Provide a process for reporting and investigating suspected violations of the code of ethics  
SMUD’s Whistleblower Anti-Retaliation policy (AP 05.01.03) was approved in 2014. SMUD’s Complaint Process Policy (AP 05.01.04) was adopted in 2006 and updated in August 2022. SMUD’s Ethics and Compliance Hotline has been in place since 2008.

3. Additional Supporting Information  
**Ethics Policy**  
In accordance with Board Policy SD-12 Ethics, SMUD developed the Code of Business Ethics and Employee Conduct, approved by the CEO & General Manager in 2020. This document supplements SMUD’s State-law mandated Conflict of Interest Code and provides an easy-to-read explanation of SMUD’s values and expectations for employee behavior. It also identifies various staff resources to obtain further guidance, as well as alternative methods to report suspected violations of SMUD’s Code of Business Ethics. The Code provides a framework for how employees should act toward customers, vendors and each other. It also emphasizes that as a publicly-owned utility, SMUD and its employees must adhere to the highest ethical standards.

All new employees receive a copy of SMUD’s Code of Business Ethics prior to or during new employee orientation and are required to review and submit a signed acknowledgement to People, Services & Strategies within 30 days of orientation. In addition, all contractors with unescorted access receive a copy of the Code when their background check is conducted. PS&S verifies Code acknowledgments on a quarterly basis to ensure signed acknowledgments are received from all new employees and contractors.

# Ethics Training

Ethics training is a mandatory requirement for all SMUD employees. They are required to complete the training every 2 years on a fixed rotating schedule. New and returning employees have one year for completion while newly promoted leaders are required to take Ethics training within 90 days of promotion into their role. Course completion is tracked using SMUD’s Learning Management System (LMS) and reported as part of SMUD’s mandatory training statistics. The 2023 completion rate for employees with 2023 due dates is 99.61%.

## Disclosure and Reporting of Potential Conflicts of Interest

The Political Reform Act (Cal. Gov. Code §§ 81000, et seq.) requires certain government officials and employees to publicly disclose certain financial information relevant to the scope of decision-making for their positions with SMUD.

To maintain compliance, all employees in positions designated by the SMUD Board must complete and submit an annual Statement of Economic Interests, FPPC Form 700 (Conflict of Interest Statement). Incumbents of designated positions shall file an Assuming Office Statement within 30 days of starting their employment or beginning the new position. Employees in designated positions who leave SMUD shall file Leaving Office Statements within 30 days of their final dates of employment.

The annual Conflict of Interest Statements are public documents filed with Corporate Records or in the designated record repository. PS&S send financial disclosure materials electronically to designated employees as early as January and through March to successfully meet the FPPC filing deadline of April 2. At the time of this report, 97.7% percent of the annual Conflict of Interest Statements from SMUD officials and designated employees were received. PS&S staff follows up to ensure total compliance. In the rare event that full compliance is not achieved, SMUD is obligated to report violations to the FPPC for enforcement. This has occurred only two times in the last decade.

## Process for Reporting and Investigating Suspected Violations

SMUD holds its employees to a higher standard than that required by law and is committed to providing a work environment in which all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. SMUD encourages employees to bring concerns about potential legal violations or violations of SMUD policies to the attention of a SMUD leader. All SMUD leaders are required to immediately report all complaints they receive regarding suspected policy violations to the Fair Employment Office. An employee who believes that they are unable to make a complaint through their management reporting line may report complaints directly to the Fair Employment Office, Labor Relations, Internal Auditor’s or General Counsel’s Office.

Additionally, SMUD has contracted with Navex Global Compliance since November 2008 to operate an anonymous Ethics and Compliance Hotline. This hotline can be used by employees to file complaints anonymously should they so choose, either online or by calling Navex Global Compliance directly.

As part of SMUD’s Complaint Process and Whistleblower Anti-Retaliation policies, a Whistleblower Committee was established to review and act, when appropriate, on hotline/whistleblower complaints. The committee is comprised of representatives from the General Counsel’s office, Internal Audit Services and PS&S, including members of our Fair Employment Office and Labor Relations team.

![Discipline by Year Chart](attachment://chart.png)

In addition to investigating potential violations of SMUD’s Nondiscrimination, Anti-Harassment and Non-Retaliation Policy (AP 05.01.01) and Code of Ethics, Labor Relations and Fair Employment analysts also advise, consult with and support leaders on recommended action and coaching to address problematic behaviors and attitudes among the workforce that are not necessarily prohibited by law. This includes working with a leaders’ leader or senior leadership when improved leadership skills would benefit relationships. These proactive measures play a critical role in a culture where all employees are respected and valued.

The following chart illustrates discipline issued to employees between 2019-2023. Summarized below are the disciplines issued for violations of SMUD’s Nondiscrimination, Anti-Harassment and Non-Retaliation Policy (AP 05.01.01) as well as discipline for misconduct/policy violations under SMUD’s Positive Discipline Policy (AP 05.02.09) including dishonesty, bullying, discourteous behavior, unprofessional conduct, driving policy violations, insubordination, conflicts of interest and unethical behavior. The below reporting does not include discipline related to safety incidents (e.g. preventable vehicle accidents), attendance (tardiness and/or absences) or work performance unless there was a conduct component covered by SMUD’s Code of Business Ethics & Employee Conduct, such as wilful negligence or dishonesty.

The chart shown next indicates violations of SMUD's Nondiscrimination, Anti-Harassment and Non-Retaliation Policy (AP 05.01.01) as they relate to protected categories for FEO investigations that occurred in the past five years.

4. Challenges  
Completing training and obtaining necessary documents can be a challenge for employees on any type of extended leave. Broad or anonymous complaints are sometimes filed without supporting and/or contact information to allow for follow-up and further investigation.

5. Recommendations  
As reflected in this report, SMUD has achieved the goals set forth in SD-12 for maintaining the public trust and confidence in the integrity and ethical conduct of the Board and SMUD employees. The policies, guidelines, staff training and monitoring and reporting components have played a part in ensuring high ethical standards in all areas of conduct and in operations.  

It is recommended the Board accept the monitoring report for Strategic Direction 12.
