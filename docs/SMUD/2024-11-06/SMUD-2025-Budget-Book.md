GM 24-161  

Board of Directors  

Re: SMUD 2025 Budget  

Dear Board Members:

I’m pleased to present SMUD’s proposed 2025 Budget of $2.3 billion. It provides funding for Operations and Maintenance (O&M), Public Good and Capital Programs needed to successfully meet the Board’s Strategic Directions. The 2025 Budget maintains compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements and provides a pathway for continued progress on our 2030 Clean Energy Vision. Staff will present detailed information at the Finance & Audit Committee meetings on Nov. 6 and 7. The 2025 Budget supports the following three priorities: Infrastructure Investment, 2030 Zero Carbon Plan and Community Impact.

**Executive Summary**  
Every year, we look holistically at our budget, programs, projects and initiatives to make sure SMUD continues to deliver value to our customers and community. The 2025 Budget funds activities that are important to support the needs of our customers and community today, while also supporting our long-term success and leadership position, including investments to meet carbon reduction mandates, maintaining and improving our infrastructure and delivering positive community impact through our many community programs and outreach. The 2025 Budget also continues to ensure SMUD’s responsible and sustainable financial stewardship and our commitment to keeping rates increases at or below inflation and our customers’ bills among the lowest in California. Our rates continue to be some of the lowest in California and are currently more than 50% lower than PG&E, on average.

Our O&M and Public Good budgets (lines b and c in the following table) are increasing by $40 million. Key initiatives in our 2025 proposed O&M and Public Good budgets include our Community Impact Plan, transportation and building electrification incentives and load flexibility programs. The O&M budget also includes funding for equipment maintenance, vegetation management, wildfire mitigation, cybersecurity and property and casualty insurance. We continue to minimize budget impacts from these items through ongoing Operational Excellence initiatives and securing grant funding, which helps reduce the impact of many increases outside our control. Our goal is to ensure every dollar we spend delivers the most value possible.

Our Capital budget (line e) is increasing by $57 million as we ramp up our investments in our infrastructure and clean energy solutions. Major capital projects for 2025 include:

Paul Lau, Chief Executive Officer & General Manager  
SMUD HQ | 6201 S Street | P.O. Box 15830 | Sacramento, CA 95852-0830 | 1.888.742.7683 | smud.org
<!-- Page 6 -->
![SMUD 2025 Budget](https://www.smud.org/-/media/Smud/Images/2025-Budget-Page-6.png)

- Connected Clean PowerCity (CCPC) projects: Grid Edge Intelligence and Outage Management System (OMS) replacement.
- Rebuilding the Elverta (El Rio) Substation.
- Ongoing construction for the Country Acres solar and storage project.
- Designing and planning for our new Folsom Administrative Operations Building.
- Preparing to upgrade our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software.

The 2025 Budget authorizes 2,295 full-time positions, an increase of 45 positions, primarily for our field operations staff and additions to our field apprentice classes. Also included is funding for our future workforce pipeline needs and flexibility for shorter-term needs, with limited-term, student and part-time positions, to support and implement our grants.

In 2025, we expect a $38 million increase in our Commodity budget (line a). Commodity spending allows SMUD to meet energy and peak capacity needs and maintain reliability for our customers. Higher system peak load will require us to increase resource adequacy (RA) purchases, which have increased significantly in cost. SMUD will also continue our commodity hedging to manage market price volatility for power and natural gas. The 2025 Budget includes assumptions for a normal water year.

We recognize the potential for new growth in our service area and have maintained conservative planning assumptions so we can act nimbly as business conditions change. To manage potential impacts to our budget and operations, we’ll monitor these and other factors throughout the year, including the local economy, construction costs and any supply chain and labor constraints.

In total, the 2025 Budget allows us to:
- Execute on our vision to provide safe, reliable, clean and affordable energy.
- Maintain reliable service—today and in the future—through strong investments in our grid and other infrastructure.
- Invest in a clean energy future to benefit all Sacramento communities.
- Have prudent financial management, which focuses on alignment of key priorities while meeting key financial metrics.

## About SMUD

As the nation’s sixth-largest, community-owned, not-for-profit electric service, SMUD has been providing low-cost, reliable electricity to Sacramento County since 1946. SMUD is a recognized industry leader and award winner for its innovative energy efficiency programs, renewable power technologies and its sustainable solutions for a healthier environment.

We provide electric service to most of Sacramento County and small, adjoining portions of Placer and Yolo counties. Our service area is divided into seven wards, each represented by an elected board member who serves a 4-year term. Our Board of Directors determines policy direction and appoints our Chief Executive Officer & General Manager, who is responsible for SMUD’s day-to-day operations.

SMUD became a Control Area, presently called a Balancing Authority (BA), in June 2002 and since then has operated its transmission and generation system independently. On January 1, 2006, the Western Area Power Administration’s Sierra Nevada Region (WAPA-SNR) was integrated into the SMUD BA, followed on December 1, 2006, by the California-Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) – a 500kV transmission line - and the Modesto Irrigation District (MID). On May 8, 2008, together with MID and the cities of Redding and Roseville, SMUD entered into a Joint Powers Agreement to create the new Balancing Authority of Northern California (BANC). With regulatory approval on May 1, 2011, the operations of SMUD BA were transferred to BANC BA. BANC uses SMUD’s existing employees and physical resources to be the BANC Operator. BANC’s General Manager reports to a five-person Commission made up of SMUD, MID, City of Redding, City of Roseville, and Trinity Public Utility Districts chief executives. This BA, as an independent entity, is not subject to market disruptions that result from financially induced supply shortages within the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) or investor-owned utilities. SMUD is still subject to certain CAISO transmission, grid management and other costs for transactions that use the CAISO controlled grid. These costs have been included in SMUD’s 2025 Budget.

# SMUD Governance

## Our Board of Directors

SMUD is owned by its customers, who elect a seven-member Board of Directors. Each director represents a different geographic area or "ward." During their four-year terms, they establish policies and values about how we serve our customers and community and set the long-term direction SMUD will take moving forward.

SMUD's Board of Directors establish our vision and guidelines. The Board reviews and approves strategies, such as Community Impact, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging (DEI&B), Electric Vehicle (EV) and Fleet, Wildfire, and Zero Carbon. The Board has the final approval for large expenditures, such as bond issuances, contracts, land purchases, and power purchase agreements. For the annual budget process, the Board approves the budgeted expenses, or authorization to spend, and monitors performance through strategic direction reporting and monthly financial updates.

# Budget Process and Assumptions

The process to complete the 2025 Budget began with setting financial limits to ensure that the budget would result in achieving our key financial metrics: Positive Net Income, Fixed Charge Ratio of at least 1.70 and Days Cash of 150 or more. With input from every business unit, we looked holistically at the work planned for the upcoming year and identified the most important work that must be done to support our Clean Energy Vision, our customers, and community. In September 2024, we presented an early look of the budget to the Board before the budget was finalized. The load, revenue, and commodity forecasts were then completed which results in the final proposed 2025 Budget.

Our planning and budgeting philosophy is to plan and measure the total cost of SMUD business processes and set performance improvement targets for the processes and Business Units that will most efficiently accomplish strategic goals. This budgeting methodology also most efficiently allocates and plans resources throughout SMUD to the Business Units and work processes.

SMUD’s Board of Directors has autonomous authority to establish the rates charged for all SMUD services. SMUD typically reviews and sets rates on a two-year cycle. This rate approval process is separate from the annual budget process. SMUD plans its revenue by using the Board approved rates in conjunction with the load forecast. Through approval of the budget, the Board provides the authorization to spend for SMUD to support the work we do to carry out our purpose of enhancing the quality of life for our customers and community by providing reliable and affordable electricity and leading the transition to a clean energy future. To learn more about our rate process please refer to the latest General Manager’s Report.

The 2025 SMUD Budget summarized on the following pages is a blueprint of planned commodity, operating, public good, debt service expenses and capital expenditures for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025. Comparisons to the 2024 Budget adopted by the Board on December 14, 2023 are shown to put the proposed 2025 Budget into perspective.

The O&M and Capital Budgets are shown on the following pages by cost type and Business Unit. SMUD Business Units correspond to business processes which deliver specific products and services to SMUD customers. The core business processes are represented by Customer & Community Services, Energy Delivery & Operations and Zero Carbon Energy Solutions Business Units. Included within Zero Carbon and Customer & Community are Public Good costs related to energy efficiency, low-income assistance, and research and development. These costs are shown separately because they are designated as Public Goods programs as determined by statute.

Within each Business Unit budget, work processes are subdivided into business segments and individual business processes. Business segments and processes enable each business unit to effectively plan and measure performance of its operations at a manageable level.

The budgeted costs shown under each core Business Unit include all the costs of performing the work planned for 2025. These include labor costs from departments throughout SMUD which perform work in the core business processes. Labor costs include employee benefits. Also included in the budget is a surcharge allocation of service costs such as fleet, facilities, information technology, workforce management and support, environmental services, real estate, safety and

More detailed and specific information is provided within each Business Unit's documentation of their proposed budget. Please refer to this section for the detailed Business Unit budgets - Business Unit Budgets.

**Public Good Budget**  
Public Good is included in the total O&M budget and is captured within the costs of the Business Unit responsible for the work. Therefore, these costs are not shown on a separate line of the O&M budget and are provided here for information only and to present details as to the programs covered.

Total Public Good is $104.8 million, which is $1.9 million less than the 2024 budget, after inclusion of rate subsidies. The Public Good 2025 Proposed Budget is $67.6 million and is the portion of the program that requires Board authorization.

Total subsidies are $37.2 million. The total cost of the Energy Assistance Program Rate (EAPR) subsidy is budgeted at $34.8 million in 2025, a decrease of $1.3 million from 2024, and the subsidy for customers using medical equipment decreased by $0.3 million for a total of $2.3 million. By December 2025, the number of subsidized customers is expected to be approximately 89,956.

Energy efficiency proposed spending of $48.7 million decreased $2.1 million over prior year. Building electrification is included in Energy Efficiency public good. The Energy Efficiency budget remains in line with the goal of reaching zero carbon by 2030. Residential Assistance decreased slightly, $0.9 million, as we shifted some operational costs to O&M. Research & Development increased $2.8 million to $11.4 million to right size the funding needed to investigate new and emerging technologies.

**Commodity Budget**  
Commodity costs are part of the total O&M budget. The Commodity 2025 Proposed Budget of $610 million is $38 million higher than the 2024 Budget. Commodities are net of surplus power sales. The budget for commodities assumes a typical water year. Purchased power is increasing primarily due to resource adequacy costs. Fuel for Generation is decreasing due to increased imports of geothermal contracts displacing SMUD thermal units.

Further details on power supply information can be found in the Supplemental Information of this document in these sections – Power Supply & Requirements, SMUD Generation Sources, and Purchased Power.

**Other Employee Benefits Budget**  
Other Employee Benefits are part of the total O&M budget and are not allocated or included as a labor expense in the Business Unit expenditures. The Other Employee Benefits 2025 Proposed Budget is $11.4 million, a decrease of $25.6 million compared to the 2024 Budget. Included are Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) expense of $8.8 million which decreased $25.1 million from the prior year budget due to retiree medical, dental and unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) amortization costs shifting from OPEB O&M to capital (to represent the shift from expense to the balance sheet to align our budget with our accounting treatment). Also, included is $2.6 million of workers’ compensation which decreased $0.5 million from the prior year budget due to reductions in reserve estimates.

The proposed 2025 capital investment budget is for planned investments in generation, transmission, distribution, buildings, vehicles, technology, and other assets critical to meeting the energy needs of our customers. Proposed capital expenditures go through a rigorous evaluation and prioritization process, based on value and risk, to ensure we fund those that have the highest contribution to the Board’s strategic directions.

The increase in capital is mainly due to the following major projects: Grid Edge Intelligence and Outage Management System (OMS) replacement, El Rio Substation, Country Acres solar and storage project, our new Folsom Administrative Operations Building and preparing to upgrade our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. Capital also includes $50.3 million in Other Expenses for OPEB/PERS amortization items. The retiree medical, dental and unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL) amortization costs and PERS unfunded accrued liability (UAL) shifted from O&M to capital (to represent the shift from expense to the balance sheet to align our budget with our accounting treatment).

The following report shows the Capital 2025 Proposed Budget categorized by Business Unit. This gives a different perspective of the capital expenditures by where the work is performed.

**Benefits Summary**

The Benefits Summary reflects allocated costs for active employee benefits, the costs to administer those benefits, and Social Security and retirement contributions for current staff. The 2025 Proposed Budget of $129 million is a decrease of $17.3 million from the 2024 Budget. The retirement contribution (PERS) unfunded accrued liability (UAL) shifted from O&M to capital (to represent the shift from expense to the balance sheet to align our budget with our accounting treatment).

The budget for benefit costs is shown as information only as 100% of these expenditures are included in the budgeted dollars of all SMUD O&M and Capital described in this documentation.

# Debt Service

The following schedules show the summary and details of the Debt Service 2025 Proposed Budget. SMUD issues electric revenue bonds and commercial paper notes to finance long-lived capital assets. The Debt Service budget includes accrued interest expense on outstanding electric revenue bonds and commercial paper notes, net of any swap revenues tied to debt issues, scheduled principal repayments of bonds and commercial paper, trustee fees associated with administration of debt service payments, and interest expense and issuance costs associated with planned new debt issues.

| Debt Service | 2024 Budget | 2025 Proposed | $ Change vs Budget | % Change vs Budget |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Interest Expense | $114,705 | $107,568 | ($7,136) | -6% |
| Interest on New Debt Issuance | - | 8,750 | 8,750 | 100% |
| Principal Repayments | 84,590 | 90,045 | 5,455 | 6% |
| Fees/Bond Issuance Cost | 6,297 | 2,102 | (4,195) | -67% |
| **Total Debt Service** | **205,592** | **208,465** | **2,874** | **1%** |
| Allocated to JPAs | (3,329) | (3,072) | 257 | -8% |
| **Net Debt Service** | **$202,263** | **$205,394** | **$3,131** | **2%** |

Interest expense on existing debt totals $107.6 million in the 2025 Proposed Budget, a decrease of $7.1 million. This is primarily due to revenue bond interest decreasing $6.5 million to $103.3 million and a slight decrease to commercial paper interest of $0.3 million. The Debt Service budget includes net debt related swap payments and interest on long-term, variable rate, and subordinated debt. The budget assumes an interest rate of 4.24% (including all related fees & swaps) on an average commercial paper balance of $100 million.

Interest on new debt issuance totals $8.8 million in the 2025 Proposed Budget. This is an estimate of interest expense for new debt expected to be issued within 2025.

Scheduled principal repayments of revenue bonds and commercial paper notes total $90.0 million in 2025, a $5.5 million increase from the 2024 Budget.

Fees/bond issuance cost of $2.1 million are included for new 2025 bond issuances and related fees.

# Budget Financial Statements

The SMUD financial statements depict the expected results of operations (Income Statement), assets and liabilities (Balance Sheet) and cash position (Statement of Cash Flow) at the end of the 2025 budget year. The Income Statement also includes "non-cash" expenses such as depreciation and amortization of capital and regulatory assets, which are not included in the 2025 Budget because funds were expended in prior budget years.

The pro forma financial statements include the consolidated accounts and operations of SMUD, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority (SFA), the Northern California Gas Agency No. 1 (NCGA No. 1) and the Northern California Energy Authority (NCEA). SFA, a joint powers authority between SMUD and Modesto Irrigation District, issued debt to construct Cosumnes Power Plant and owns and operates the plant. In late 2021, ownership of the Carson Project, the Proctor & Gamble Project, the Cambell Soup Project, and McClellan were transferred to SFA. SMUD has entered into a long-term Power Purchase Agreement with SFA to purchase all the plants’ output and pay for Joint Powers Authority (JPA) and plant costs. NCGA No. 1 is a joint powers authority that has issued bonds and used the proceeds to prepay long-term natural gas supply contracts. SMUD has entered into an agreement to buy all the gas procured by NCGA No. 1 but is not liable for repayment of the bonds in the event of a default. NCEA is a joint powers authority that has issued bonds and used the proceeds to prepay long-term commodity supply contracts. SMUD has entered into an agreement to buy all the commodities procured by NCEA but is not liable for repayment of the bonds in the event of a default. The relationship between SMUD, SFA, NCGA No. 1 and NCEA meets the criteria established by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) for consolidation in the controlling entity's financial statements.

The consolidated income statement reports all SMUD’s revenues and expenses for the periods shown. The 2025 Proposed Budget will produce $117.6 million of net income for SMUD, which is a decrease of $7.7 million from the 2024 Budget. The fixed charge coverage ratio is planned at 2.03 times operating cash flow. Revenue from electric sales has increased compared to the 2024 Budget due to the impact of the approved 2025 rate increases.

The budgeted and actual fixed charge ratio and net income as shown on the consolidated income statement are primary measures of SMUD’s financial performance which are monitored closely by the bond rating agencies in setting SMUD’s credit rating. The fixed charge ratio is a measure of the number of times net operating cash flow before interest expense covers total cash debt service payments, including both interest and principal, for SMUD, the JPAs and SMUD’s share of Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) debt service. Net income is the residual after deducting all expenses from revenues for the period.

The cash flow statement shows the budgeted sources and uses of cash and the projected year-end unrestricted cash balance for 2025. SMUD's current practice is to maintain unrestricted cash and Rate Stabilization Fund (RSF) balances at a minimum of 150 days cash on hand. At the end of 2025, SMUD’s unrestricted cash balance is projected to be $551.9 million, in addition to the Rate Stabilization Fund balance of $71.7 million. The Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund balance, which is expected to be $88 million, is not included in this target minimum.

SMUD generates positive net cash flow from operations because of net income and non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization. In 2025, cash generated from operations is estimated to total approximately $485.6 million. The primary uses of this cash are capital investments, scheduled debt principal repayments and interest payments. The 2025 Proposed Budget for capital investment totals $612 million less expected revenues of $38.3 million. Scheduled debt principal repayments in 2025 total $90 million for SMUD and $14.3 million for SFA (detail included in SFA budget documentation).

We currently maintain $300 million in commercial paper capacity and a $100 million line of credit. Any new money needs can be handled through short-term borrowing or issuing new long-term debt.

# Power Supply & Requirements

The 2030 Zero Carbon Plan is the basis for the operating assumptions for the 2025 Proposed Budget. Electricity and natural gas prices are forecasted to be lower than what was projected in the 2024 Budget. The Upper American River Project (UARP) generation will be slightly higher due to less planned outages, renewable generation is expected to be higher than the 2024 budget due to Solano 4 being on-line for the full year, and thermal generation is expected to be lower due to importing renewable geothermal contracts.

## Energy Sales & Requirements

Total expected supply requirements for the 2025 Proposed Budget are forecasted to be approximately 2% higher than the 2024 Budget. Our expected retail energy sales to customers are projected to increase and our expected system peak load is forecasted to increase.

The following tables provide additional information regarding generation, purchased power and market transactions.

# SMUD Generation Sources

**SMUD Hydroelectric (Upper American River Project)**  
The 2025 Budget assumes median rainfall and normal starting reservoir levels in 2025. Generation is expected to be 1,645 GWh.

**Other SMUD Renewable Generation: South Fork, Chili Bar, Photovoltaic, Hedge Battery, Solano Wind**  
The 2025 Budget assumes average generation subject to limitations governing the operation of each location. The largest contributor, Solano Wind, is expected to generate 900 GWh.

**Cosumnes Power Plant**  
This 603 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant began commercial operation in February 2006. Forecasted generation from this plant in 2025 is 3,782 GWh.

**Carson Cogeneration**  
This gas-fired cogeneration project, which began commercial operation in October 1995, consists of a 65 MW combined cycle unit and a 42 MW peaking unit. With the installation of an auxiliary steam boiler in 2017, if running the cogeneration unit is uneconomic, it can be turned off. Energy will be supplied from the auxiliary boiler instead of the cogeneration unit. The forecasted generation from this facility in 2025 is 327 GWh.

**Procter & Gamble Cogeneration**  
This gas-fired cogeneration plant began commercial operation in March 1997. It consists of a 136 MW combined cycle power plant and a 50 MW peaking unit that became operational in May 2001. With the installation of an auxiliary steam boiler in 2016, if running the cogeneration unit is uneconomic, it can be turned off. Steam will be supplied from the auxiliary boiler instead of the cogeneration unit. Forecasted generation from this facility in 2025 is 632 GWh.

**Campbell Soup Cogeneration**  
This gas-fired combined cycle plant began commercial operation in December 1997. It consists of a 160 MW combined cycle power unit. Beginning in 2008 the 72 MW McClellan gas turbine is also included under SPA. Forecasted generation from these two units in 2025 is 573 GWh.

The balance of energy requirements to meet forecasted sales to customers will be met by short-term purchases of energy.

Some of the long-term and short-term contracts will be delivered over SMUD’s 528 MW share of the California-Oregon Transmission Project (Northwest) or under the South-of-Tesla transmission agreement with PG&E (Southwest & Southern California). These purchases are coordinated through SMUD’s membership in the Western Systems Power Pool (WSPP), which facilitates sales and exchanges among its 30 member utilities, and through market trading.

*SMUD thermal emissions are estimates based on 2025 forecast and historical emissions factors.

Based on 2025 budgeted generation from SMUD thermals, purchased power, hydro generation, and renewables, our SD-7 greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to be about 2.0 million metric tonnes. This estimate is based on normal conditions, and the use of our thermals and associated emissions could be lower or higher based on actual conditions in the 2025 operating year. Further, the estimate assumes our short-term power purchases are from general market power which carry an emissions factor. While carbon-free power purchases are subject to hydro conditions and availability year to year, SMUD’s Energy Traders continually look for opportunities to purchase clean power from the market to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our portfolio.

# Cost Categories (or funding types)

The budget includes the following major components:

**Operating Expenses (O&M):** Expenses related to producing and acquiring energy, operating and maintaining the electrical delivery system, providing service to customers including public goods (energy efficiency, low-income assistance, new renewable generation sources, and research and development of advanced technologies) programs, and corporate activities. Included within this category as a separate line item are commodity costs associated with energy supply. These costs include purchased power, fuel for energy production, and transmission wheeling costs.

Also included in O&M are operating and interest expense associated with SFA: Carson Cogeneration plant, Procter & Gamble plant, Campbell Soup Cogeneration plant, Cosumnes Power Plant; NCGA No. 1, and NCEA pass-through gas costs. These expenses are shown in the SMUD budget because SMUD will reimburse SFA, NCGA No. 1 and NCEA for their costs under the terms of the Power and Gas Purchase Agreements. The detailed SFA, NCGA No. 1 and NCEA budgets are also in separate booklets and/or resolutions as they will be approved by the SFA, NCGA No. 1 and NCEA Commissions.

**Capital Investments:** Investment in additions and improvements to SMUD’s property, plant and equipment. The Capital investment budget includes all qualifying costs related to acquiring or constructing tangible and intangible assets which meet SMUD’s capitalization guidelines - cost exceeding $5,000 and an estimated service life greater than two years. SMUD follows Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) capitalization guidelines which dictate the inclusion of all direct costs (labor, employee benefits, materials, services and other) and a proportionate share of indirect costs (engineering and construction supervision and support, transportation, insurance, etc.) related to capital projects. Capital assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful service life.

**Allocated Expenses:** A portion of the costs in four business units: Information Technology, Workforce, Diversity & Enterprise Partnerships, Energy Delivery & Operations and Corporate, which enable the business units to perform work. These costs are pooled and then allocated to both O&M and capital costs based on the quantity of labor hours planned in the receiving business unit. The aggregated allocated costs are presented in the budget documentation separately as information only; the actual costs are reflected in each of the Business Unit’s budgets as part of the total cost of their work processes. Examples of allocated costs are enterprise-wide used software, safety services, human resources, procurement and fleet services.

**Debt Service:** Interest expense on and principal repayments of SMUD’s outstanding long-term debt and commercial paper notes, any revenues or payments on interest rate swaps, and trustee fees and debt issuance costs.

**Reimbursements:** Reimbursements, cost-sharing grants, or pass-through amounts received from outside parties to reduce net costs.

**Allocations/Surcharges:** Includes cost center overheads and surcharges. Cost center overheads are a rate developed to recover the indirect costs of a Cost Center and includes labor for administration, supervision, training, and miscellaneous expenses such as office supplies and travel. It is assessed per hour of labor planned directly to the work processes. Surcharge rates are developed to recover 1) an allocation of internal service costs such as transportation and technology assessed per hour of labor planned directly to the work processes, 2) the costs of procuring outside service agreements and costs of procuring, storing, and handling materials and equipment and 3) miscellaneous general and administrative SMUD expenses including insurance and risk management, cash management, debt management, and other assessed to capital and public good projects based on a flat percentage of overall SMUD labor.

# RESOLUTION NO. ________________

WHEREAS, the proposed 2025 Budget is expected to result in a positive net income for 2025; NOW THEREFORE,

BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:

## Section 1.
This resolution may be referred to as the 2025 Budget Resolution.

## Section 2.
(a) There is hereby appropriated from the General Fund sufficient monies for the payment of demands against SMUD which relate to obligations incurred for the purposes and within the amount specified for such purposes in the following projection of SMUD’s program for the period January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025.

### Operations and maintenance:
- Commodity - purchased power, fuel, and wheeling: $610,000,000
- Public Goods: $67,630,890
- Customer, energy delivery, zero carbon, workforce diversity & enterprise partnerships, information technology, corporate services & Rancho Seco: $786,248,204

**Sub-Total:** $1,463,879,094

### Debt Service
- $205,393,922
- Capital and reserve: $612,031,708

**TOTAL:** $2,281,304,724

<!-- Page 92 -->
(b) The Commodity line-item budget is based on assumptions of average rainfall and temperatures during 2025. SMUD has in place a Hydro Generation Adjustment (SMUD HGA) mechanism whereby, based on the actual rainfall amounts between April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025 in comparison to the budget assumptions, SMUD may transfer funds to or from the Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund and, once pre-established limits are met, increase or decrease customer rates. The Commodity line-item budget will be increased or reduced based on the actual transfer and/or change in customer revenues from the SMUD HGA adjustment.

(c) SMUD has budgeted to receive energy in 2025 under its contract with the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). SMUD has in place a WAPA Hydro Generation Adjustment (WAPA HGA) mechanism whereby, based on the actual delivery from WAPA between April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025 in comparison to the budget assumptions, SMUD may transfer funds to or from the WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund and, once pre-established limits are met, increase or decrease customer rates. This energy primarily is generated at Central Valley Project hydroelectric plants, and the actual quantity of energy received will be dependent on rainfall, carryover water storage and operation of the WAPA system to meet contractual water deliveries. Because WAPA generation facilities are spread over a wide area, insurance is not practical for offsetting variations of energy deliveries due to weather. One purpose of the Rate Stabilization Fund is to mitigate such variations. The Commodity line-item

Page 92
<!-- Page 93 -->
![Draft Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Draft+Document)

budget will be increased or reduced based on the actual transfer and/or change in customer revenues from the WAPA HGA adjustment

(d) Budgeted energy purchases necessary to meet customer energy sales requirements (10,500 GWh) are based on average weather conditions and expected customer growth in 2025. Should actual weather conditions or growth levels cause SMUD retail sales and related energy requirements to be higher, the Commodity line item budget will be increased by the NP15 power price per megawatt-hour of additional retail energy sales to offset the cost of these sales.

(e) SMUD participates in regulatory programs such as Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and Cap-and-Trade. Under these programs, SMUD has the option to monetize the credits and allowances applicable to these programs through sales transactions. When SMUD collects revenues through these sales, it is required to apply the proceeds toward specific expenses that support the program goals. An additional purpose of the Rate Stabilization Fund is to mitigate fluctuations from regulatory programs. The Accountant is hereby authorized to transfer funds to or from the Rate Stabilization Fund to match LCFS and Cap-and-Trade revenues with expenses. The budgeted amount will be increased or decreased accordingly.

(f) For purposes of Section 11891.6 of the Municipal Utility District Act, there shall be deemed added to each line item, in section 2a, a 10 percent contingency. Demands against SMUD which relate to obligations incurred for each line item and are within such line item amount plus the 10

Page 93
<!-- Page 94 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=DRAFT)

percent contingency may be paid without prior specific approval of this Board, provided the total of such payments during 2025 may not exceed the total budget amount plus this 10% contingency, plus the commodity contingency and adjustments for weather hedge contracts, higher retail sales and Rate Stabilization transfers as set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) above.

**Section 3.** Demands against SMUD may be paid without the prior specific approval of this Board if they relate to obligations incurred for the purpose and within the amounts specified in Section 2, provided such demands are approved by the CEO & General Manager or someone to whom he has delegated such approval authority. It is the purpose and intent of this paragraph to delegate to the CEO & General Manager authority to make purchases, to negotiate and execute contracts, and expend funds in any manner necessary or appropriate to the administration of the business affairs of SMUD, all within the amounts and for the purposes set forth above, and subject to the provisions of existing law and of all the duly passed resolutions of this Board, including the Board-approved delegations of authority.

**Section 4.** At monthly intervals, the Treasurer shall transfer from the General Fund appropriate amounts into each of the various funds established to service SMUD’s general obligation indebtedness, its Electric System Revenue Bond indebtedness, and its Electric Revenue Bond indebtedness in approximately equal installments as set forth in the tabulations on file with the Accountant. Investment authority, for all funds, is delegated to the Treasurer for a one-year period in accordance with California Code Section 53607.

**Section 5.** The number of permanent full-time employees during 2025 shall not exceed 2,295 employees plus a five percent contingency without further authorization of this Board.

**Section 6.** The Public Goods Charge shall be adjusted for expenditures of $104.8 million, which exceeds the minimum of 2.85% of 1994 revenues. The percentage allocation for the public goods charge expenditures shall apply to low-income assistance, energy efficiency, research and development, and new renewable generation.

**Section 7.** The CEO & General Manager, or his designee, is authorized to make future changes to the Budget that, in his prudent judgment: (a) further the primary purpose of the Budget; (b) are intended to provide a net benefit to SMUD; and (c) do not exceed the authorized Budget amounts and applicable contingencies.

**WHEREAS**, the Board of Directors of SMUD desires to inform its customers and the public of its plans for financing capital improvements and other capital expenditures to its system by specifying certain items for which the proceeds of said revenue bonds are to be used, which uses shall not include daily maintenance and operations costs; **NOW, THEREFORE,**

**BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:**

**Section 1.** The Board of Directors of SMUD declares its intention to authorize the issuance of additional revenue bonds or Green Bonds for the purpose of financing, in whole or in part, the costs of the capital items identified in SMUD’s 2025 capital budget, 2023 and 2024 capital expenditures not previously financed, the prepayment of purchased power or natural gas, and pipelines or storage facilities, for all of which SMUD is authorized by law to issue such bonds. SMUD has paid or reasonably expects to pay certain expenditures (the “Reimbursement Expenditures”) in connection with such capital items prior to the issuance of such bonds, and hereby officially declares its intent to use certain proceeds of such bonds to reimburse the Reimbursement Expenditures. The declarations contained in this section are made solely for purposes of establishing compliance with Section 1.150-2 of the U. S. Treasury Regulations, and do not bind SMUD to make any expenditure, incur any indebtedness or proceed with the above-mentioned capital expenditures.

**Section 2.** The maximum principal amount of the additional revenue bonds proposed to be issued under this supplemental resolution is $400,000,000. Such maximum principal amount is in addition to the

**Page 98**
<!-- Page 99 -->
$9,055,000,000 principal amount of revenue bonds authorized pursuant to the Prior Resolutions. Such additional bonds may be issued in series from time to time, and it shall not be necessary that all of the bonds proposed to be issued be issued at any one time.

Proceeds from the issuance of these bonds will be used to finance capital improvements identified in SMUD's 2025 capital budget, 2023 and 2024 capital expenditures not previously financed, capital expenditures for the prepayment of purchased power or natural gas, and pipelines or storage facilities. The declarations in this section are made solely to establish compliance with Section 12852 of the California Public Utilities Code, and do not bind SMUD to make any expenditure, incur any indebtedness or proceed with the above-mentioned capital expenditures.

**Section 3.** The maximum term of any of such bonds is 40 years. In the event the maximum authorized amount under a series of bonds is divided into two or more series, the said maximum term shall be calculated in each case from the date of each divided series of bonds.

**Section 4.** The maximum rate of interest to be payable upon such bonds shall not exceed the interest rate per annum equal to the greater of fifteen percent (15 percent) per annum or the yield of United States Treasury bonds having a remaining term equal, as nearly as practicable, to the final maturity of such bonds, as determined by SMUD as of the date of sale of such bonds, plus three percent (3 percent). The maximum discount with respect to such bonds shall not exceed ten percent (10 percent).

**Section 5.** This resolution shall take effect immediately, subject only to the right of referendum provided in Article 6a of Chapter 6 of Division 6 of the California Public Utilities Code (beginning at Section 12850 thereof).

**Section 6.** The Secretary of SMUD is hereby directed to publish a copy of this resolution once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published within SMUD’s boundaries. At any time within 60 days after the date of the second such publication, a referendum petition signed by voters in number equal to at least three percent (3 percent) of the total vote cast, as defined in Section 11507 of the California Public Utilities Code, demanding the submission of this resolution to a vote of the voters of SMUD for their assent to the issuance of the proposed bonds, may be filed with the Secretary of SMUD. Upon presentation to the Secretary of SMUD of such a referendum petition, this resolution shall not be of effect unless and until it has been assented to by the voters.
