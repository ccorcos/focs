# SFA THERMAL FLEET

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority (SFA) is a Joint Powers Authority (JPA) formed by Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) and currently consists of five separate Thermal plants: Campbell Power Plant, Carson Power Plant, Cosumnes Power Plant, McClellan Power Plant, and Procter & Gamble Power Plant. On November 1, 2021, these plants transferred individual JPA ownerships to SFA.

## CAMPBELL POWER PLANT / MCCLELLAN POWER PLANT

The plant is located at 3215 47th Avenue, Sacramento, CA. The plant consists of a 160 MW clean-burning gas-fired combined cycle turbine generator unit. Besides electricity, the plant can generate steam, which could be sold to a suitable steam host. The plant's original steam host, Campbell Soup Supply Company, closed their factory in 2013 and no suitable replacement has been identified. The plant burns natural gas, which is supplied through natural gas pipelines owned and operated by SMUD. SMUD has designed and built transmission and telecommunications facilities to integrate the plant into SMUD’s electrical system.

On May 11, 2007, the McClellan Gas Turbine (McClellan) facility was acquired through an Asset Sales Agreement. At that time, the operation and maintenance of McClellan became a secondary function of Campbell Power Plant. The McClellan gas turbine is a 72 MW simple cycle combustion turbine with both fast and black start capabilities. McClellan has been in commercial operation at the McClellan business park in Sacramento County since 1986. All electricity produced by McClellan is sold to SMUD.

## CARSON POWER PLANT

The plant is a cogeneration plant located adjacent to the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (SRCSCD) facility in southern Sacramento County. The plant consists of one clean-burning gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine generator unit, one steam turbine generator unit, and one simple cycle gas turbine for a combined capacity of 107.5 MW. Besides electricity, the plant generates steam that is sold to SRCSCD and an adjacent ice producing facility owned by the Glacier Valley Ice Company (Glacier Ice). The units are permitted to burn both digester gas from the SRCSCD facility, which was previously flared, and natural gas. SMUD has designed and built transmission and telecommunications facilities to integrate the plant into SMUD’s electrical system. Since January 2012, Carson Power Plant has been cleaning the digester gas it receives from SRCSCD to pipeline quality and selling it to SMUD for use in the Cosumnes Power Plant, where it can be used more efficiently.

## COSUMNES POWER PLANT

Cosumnes is located on a property adjacent to the decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station near the town of Herald, in the County of Sacramento. The plant consists of two ultra-low emissions, F-class, high efficiency gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine generator units, two heat recovery boilers, and one steam turbine generator unit with a combined, net capacity of 602 MW. The plant burns natural gas, which is supplied through a natural gas pipeline owned and operated by SMUD. SMUD has designed and built transmission and telecommunications facilities to integrate the plant into SMUD’s electrical system.

## PROCTER & GAMBLE POWER PLANT

The Procter & Gamble Power Plant is located adjacent to the Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company (Procter & Gamble) in Sacramento County. The plant consists of two clean-burning gas-fired combined cycle gas turbine generator units, one steam turbine generator unit, and one simple cycle gas turbine for a combined capacity of 190.3 MW. Besides electricity, the plant generates steam, which is sold to Procter & Gamble. The plant burns natural gas, which is supplied through a natural gas pipeline owned and operated by SMUD. SMUD has designed and built transmission and telecommunications facilities to integrate the plant into SMUD’s electrical system.

# 2025 SFA – Thermal Fleet Budget

The 2025 SFA – Thermal Fleet Budget covers the expected financial operations of all the thermal plants. These budgets represent expenses to be incurred and/or paid by SFA in 2025 while running and conducting the business of each plant. The second part of the budget lists capital and other expenditures proposed for 2025. Also included in this document is a pro forma financial statement. This statement incorporates SFA revenues and non-cash expenses such as depreciation to show the complete financial results of operations for the year.

The operation of SFA is governed by a series of agreements, among the JPA members and outside parties. A description of these agreements follows:

**JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT**, SMUD will provide technical and administrative services for SFA pursuant to the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), as SFA has no employees. The SFA Board consists primarily of the SMUD Board with one non-voting member representing Modesto Irrigation District (MID).

**POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT (PPA)** between SMUD and SFA. SFA has agreed to sell to SMUD and SMUD has agreed to purchase the energy and capacity from the Thermal Fleet. SMUD will pay SFA for its costs whether the plants are operating or not. This agreement will be in effect until terminated by SMUD, but in no case before the bonds for Cosumnes Power Plant is paid in full. This agreement covers the terms of how the fleet will be operated (SMUD will dispatch) and the calculation of payments from SMUD to SFA for operation of the plants.

**GAS SUPPLY AGREEMENT (GSA)** between SMUD and SFA. SMUD will arrange for all natural gas supply and transportation requirements for the SFA, and SMUD will charge SFA for SMUD’s actual supply and transportation costs properly allocable to each plant.

**WATER SUPPLY AGREEMENT** between SMUD and SFA covers the terms under which SMUD supplies all water to the Cosumnes Power Plant.

**OPERATIONS & MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (O&M AGREEMENT)** between SFA and Ethos Energy Power Plant Services (Ethos), the plant operator. SFA has contracted with Ethos to operate, repair, overhaul and maintain the thermal fleet for a five-year term effective January 1, 2016, in exchange for payments tied to specified plant performance standards. On August 21, 2020, SFA exercised a onesided renewal clause extending the agreement for a second five-year term.

**GROUND LEASE AGREEMENT** between SMUD and SFA covers the terms of SFA’s ground lease for the property on which the plants are located.

**INDENTURE OF TRUST (INDENTURE)** between SFA – Cosumnes Power Plant and U.S. Bank National Association. This agreement covers the terms and conditions of the Trust Estate executed on behalf of the bondholders. It secures and pledges revenues to the payment of principal and interest on the bonds and ensures compliance by SFA with all covenants contained therein.

**COMMODITY AGREEMENT** between SFA – Carson Power Plant and SRCSD. This agreement covers the terms and conditions of the sale of digester gas from the SRCSD to SFA and the sale of steam from SFA to SRCSD.
<!-- Page 6 -->
![Thermal Energy Sales and Sublease Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Thermal+Energy+Sales+and+Sublease+Agreement)

**THERMAL ENERGY SALES AND SUBLEASE AGREEMENT** between SFA – Carson Power Plant and Glacier Ice. This agreement covers the terms and conditions of energy sales from SFA to Glacier Ice. In September 2016, the second amendment to this agreement was signed wherein SFA replaced the steam driven refrigeration equipment with electrically driven motors. The electrification project was completed in February 2017.

**STEAM SALES AGREEMENT** between SMUD and Procter & Gamble, and Steam Services Agreement assigning SMUD’s rights to SFA. These agreements cover the terms and conditions of steam sales from SFA to Procter & Gamble.

**NATURAL GAS PRICES** are based on SMUD’s actual costs obligated to firm natural gas purchases and estimates for the non-firm portion prepared by SMUD’s Energy Trading & Contracts group. The variable rate is based on the latest available Petroleum Industry Research Associates forecast of commodity prices by month for 2025, plus 3.2% fuel use. The fixed component represents SFA’s pro rata share of fixed capacity costs on the Alberta Gas Company/NOVA Corporation of Alberta/Pacific Gas Transmission Company (ANG/NOVA/PGT) interstate pipelines, and its pro rata share of depreciation, interest, and O&M costs on SMUD’s ownership interest in the Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) Line 300/401 interstate pipeline and SMUD’s local gas pipeline. The monthly prices are shown on the Operating Assumptions page.

**FIXED OPERATING FEE** to be paid from SFA to Ethos is based on the flat annual base operating fee per the O&M Agreement. This payment is assumed to cover all direct and indirect labor costs, including benefits, taxes, insurance, home office support, management and supervision incurred by Ethos. This payment escalates in future years at 2.5% per year in accordance with the existing O&M Agreement.

**REIMBURSABLE & MAINTENANCE OVERHAUL OPERATING COSTS** to be paid from SFA to Ethos are based on estimated variable plant operating costs, excluding fuel, to be incurred by Ethos in 2025.

# 2025 SFA – THERMAL FLEET BUDGET

## LINE-ITEM DETAIL

### FUEL
This schedule shows details of the budgeted expenses for fuel to be burned at each plant.

### OPERATION & MAINTENANCE
- **OPERATOR FEES & BONUSES:** The budget for operator fees and plant operating expenses represents fees to be paid to Ethos under the terms of the O&M Agreement, plus actual plant operating expenses incurred by Ethos and reimbursed from SFA without markup. The budget shows the portion paid to Ethos as an operating expense. Under the terms of the O&M Agreement, Ethos is reimbursed for all plant operating and maintenance expenses, and repairs. Ethos will earn performance bonuses under the O&M Agreement if the combined cycle Equivalent Forced Outage Factor is less than five percent (5%). Ethos will also earn bonuses for maintaining a peaking plant successful call-up ratio based on how successfully the unit starts and generates electricity when needed. The 2025 budget assumes that Ethos will successfully earn these bonuses.

- **OPERATOR REIMBURSEABLE EXPENSES:** Under the terms of the O&M Agreement and PPA, various tests (heat rate, NDC, etc.) of plant operations may be required by SMUD or SFA during the year. This line item covers the estimated reimbursement to Ethos for performing such tests, or for other items not covered by the O&M Agreement.

- **OPERATING EXPENSES:** This represents the estimated cost of various expenses required to keep the plants within operational expectations. This includes Water/Sewage, Station Service Electricity, and the Site Lease.

### ADMINISTRATION & GENERAL COSTS
Under the terms of the JPA, SMUD will provide staff to perform administrative and technical support services to SFA and arrange for insurance coverage, and SMUD will be reimbursed for the cost of providing these services subject to available funds per the priority of distribution of SFA revenues. SMUD will contract with engineering specialists to assist in technical engineering and regulatory compliance issues which arise during operation. Also, SFA retains the services of an Independent Auditor to audit and certify the SFA financial statements and evaluate internal controls applicable to SFA.

# 2025 SFA BUDGET
## PRO FORMA FINANCIAL SCHEDULES

SFA maintains its accounting records in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and generally follows the Uniform System of Accounts for Public Utilities and Licensees prescribed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). The following schedules are the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Position and Revenue Detail Schedule, which show the projected results of operations, for SFA during the 2025 budget period based on the 2025 budget assumptions and expense and capital budgets.

## REVENUE DETAIL:
Schedule details expected SFA Revenue during the 2025 budget period.

- **ELECTRIC REVENUE:** Under the terms of the PPA, SMUD is obligated to make monthly payments to SFA for energy provided by SFA. These payments are based on certain assumptions and rates, which were detailed under Budget Assumptions. The estimate assumes the plant operator will maintain the minimum availability factor for the combined cycle plant necessary to qualify for maximum payments.

- **OPERATING PAYMENT:** Under the terms of the PPA, SMUD will pay SFA an amount equal to the sum of all costs and expenses payable by SFA pursuant to the Lease and Property Agreement, the O&M Agreement, the GSA, all insurance costs and any cost or expense otherwise incurred in the operation and maintenance SFA, including capital improvements and overhaul expenses, plus $200,000 per month to each plant to cover other SFA obligations.
