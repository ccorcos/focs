# Summary & conclusions

- We are making good progress and are ahead of or on track to meet most ZCP customer portfolio goals so far
- Goals in all portfolios sharply increase over the next few years so path forward will become steeper
  - Tailwinds include broad support from our community along with state and local policies, and building codes and standards
  - Coordination with Federal and State programs will be important especially in supporting low- and moderate-income customer segments to participate in the ZCP journey
  - Grants and partnerships will also continue to be key elements needed to support acceleration to meet 2030 goals
