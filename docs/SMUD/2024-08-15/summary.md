## Elverta/McClellan 69 kV Feeder Tie Project Overview

The Elverta/McClellan 69 kV Feeder Tie Project, proposed by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD), aims to enhance electrical service reliability in northern Sacramento County and the northwestern portion of the City of Sacramento. The project will replace approximately 5.5 miles of existing above-ground 12 kilovolt (kV) cable with new 69 kV and 12 kV cables.

### Project Location and Alignment

- The project alignment extends from a connection point approximately 140 feet south of the intersection of Winters Street and Rene Avenue to the intersection of Q Street and 20th Street to the north, and Elkhorn Boulevard and 34th Street to the east.
- The alignment runs along the western edge of the McClellan Air Business Park and through the community of Rio Linda, covering approximately 5.5 linear miles.
- The project will involve the replacement or relocation of around 140 power line poles and the installation of approximately 10 new poles.

### Project Objectives

- Enhance SMUD’s electrical service reliability.
- Provide safe and reliable electrical service to existing and proposed developments, including the expansion of the Prime Data Center and Amazon’s electric vehicle (EV) fleet charging.
- Increase operational flexibility between circuits.
- Maximize the use of available SMUD property and resources.
- Minimize impacts to nearby sensitive receptors and natural communities.

### Construction Details

- Construction is expected to commence in Summer 2024 and conclude by Summer 2025, conducted in three phases: Phase 1, Phase 2A, and Phase 2B.
- Phase 1 will involve the replacement or relocation of 65 poles and the installation of 7 new poles.
- Construction will adhere to local noise ordinances, prohibiting activities between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. in the City of Sacramento and between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. in Sacramento County.
- The project will utilize both steel and wooden poles, with heights not exceeding 70 feet above ground level. The highest pole will be 90 feet tall, set in a 20-foot-deep hole, spaced approximately 150-200 feet apart.

### Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures

- The Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) indicates less-than-significant impacts on various environmental factors, including:
  - **Aesthetics:** No substantial alteration to the visual character of the area.
  - **Biological Resources:** Mitigation measures to protect special-status species and habitats, including training for construction personnel.
  - **Cultural Resources:** Adherence to measures protecting known cultural resources, with construction halted if unanticipated archaeological resources are discovered.
  - **Air Quality:** Implementation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to minimize construction-related emissions.

- The IS/MND was distributed for public review from May 13, 2024, to June 24, 2024. An in-person public meeting on May 28, 2024, had two attendees, with one general comment received.

### Community Oversight and Engagement

- SMUD commits to transparency and community engagement throughout the project, aligning with SMUD’s Sustainable Communities Initiative to promote environmental equity and economic vitality, particularly in historically underserved neighborhoods.

### Important Decisions and Reports

- The Board of Directors of SMUD reviewed and accepted the IS/MND and the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, concluding no substantial evidence indicates significant environmental effects. The board's resolution confirms compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and reflects the board's independent judgment and analysis.

### Conclusion

The Elverta/McClellan 69 kV Feeder Tie Project enhances Sacramento's electrical infrastructure by replacing outdated power lines and poles. The project aims to meet growing energy demands while ensuring environmental protection and compliance with local regulations, ultimately improving service reliability for existing and future developments.
