# Board Monitoring Report 2024  
## SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management  

### 1. Background  
Strategic Direction 17 states that:  
Effectively balancing and managing risk to further SMUD’s policies and business goals is a core value of SMUD.  

Therefore:  
SMUD will implement and maintain an integrated enterprise risk management process that identifies, assesses, prudently manages, and mitigates a variety of risks facing SMUD, including financial, supply, operational, physical and cyber security, climate change, legal, legislative and regulatory, and reputational risk.  

### 2. Executive summary  
SMUD is in compliance with SD-17 Enterprise Risk Management. SMUD strategically manages risk to proactively reduce the chance of loss and take advantage of opportunities that support SMUD’s mission. In addition, as presented to the Policy Committee in June 2024, SMUD is maturing its risk management framework and reporting structure, the results of which will be presented to the Board in 2025 through Policy Committee updates ahead of the next Annual Monitoring Report.  

In preparation for the 2024 Annual Monitoring Report, staff interviewed and surveyed management to determine current risk levels. Enterprise risks are assessed by impact, likelihood and velocity to determine residual risk, or the risk remaining after mitigations and internal controls have been implemented.  

Overall, SMUD’s residual risk exposure has remained steady at medium/high. In many cases, the probability or potential impact of an adverse event increased, but SMUD leveraged its risk framework successfully to introduce new controls or mitigations that allowed the residual risk level to stay the same.  

Summarized below is the current Residual Risk Exposure over a three-year period.  

| Residual Risk Exposure | Nov. 2022 | Nov. 2023 | Nov. 2024 |
|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| “Red”: Extremely High Residual Exposure | 0         | 0         | 0         |
| “Orange”: High Residual Exposure | 6         | 5         | 5         |
| “Yellow”: Medium Residual Exposure | 39        | 40        | 41        |
| “Green”: Low Residual Exposure | 38        | 40        | 39        |
| “Blue”: Extremely Low Residual Exposure | 0         | 0         | 0         |
| **Total** | **83**    | **85**    | **85**    |

Although the counts remain the same from 2023 to 2024, we had two changes to risk levels:  
- Business agility – Changed from “Yellow” or medium to “Green” or low  
- Demand response – Changed from “Green” or low to “Yellow” or medium

- Employee Safety was incorrectly categorized as “Green” or low in 2023 SD-17 Monitoring Report and has been corrected to “Yellow” or medium in 2024.

Staff continues to implement risk mitigation strategies to balance residual risk exposures. There are currently 46 risks, shown in the last two lines of the table, which are within the risk management goal.

| Current Residual Risk Exposure | Risk Management Goal | Number of Risks |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Orange “high”                  | Yellow “medium”      | 5                |
| Yellow “medium”                | Green “low”          | 34               |
| Yellow “medium”                | Yellow “medium”      | 7                |
| Green “low”                    | Green “low”          | 39               |

Changes to SMUD’s risk landscape this year include increased cyber events, physical security concerns, disruptive technology, global and political unrest, supply chain shortages, and continued unprecedented weather events. SMUD is focused on building resiliency measures into our enterprise risk management practices to be better able to monitor and respond to hazards or uncertainties and adapt to a rapidly changing risk landscape.

### 3. Additional Supporting Information

#### A. 2024 Risk Management Highlights

In 2024, ERM continued to:
- support the organization by facilitating risk conversations, supporting special projects, and providing a uniform risk framework
- enhance cross-functional discussion and thorough understanding of major risk issues by leveraging five committees, including the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee (EROC), Risk Champions Network (RCN), Trading Operations Risk Committee (TORC), Zero Carbon Plan Steering Committee, and the Three Lines Working Team

In terms of new efforts, ERM began a refresh of its risk framework to better anticipate and accommodate our changing risk landscape. Internal Audit Services and KPMG, a global consulting firm, completed a maturity assessment of SMUD’s Enterprise Risk Management program in April 2024 to identify potential areas for improvement. Results from the maturity assessment were presented to the Policy Committee in June 2024. SMUD incorporated several changes into how we manage enterprise risk in support of their recommendations. To that end, SMUD:
- realigned the Enterprise Risk Management function with Strategy
- created the new Enterprise Strategy & Risk team under the Chief Financial Officer
- hired and onboarded a new Enterprise Risk Program Manager
- aligned and coordinated commodity risk reporting with overall enterprise risk reporting on a quarterly basis
- continued to support decision-making during the enterprise prioritization, planning and budget process
- Created a plan for further ERM enhancements and implementation of KPMG recommendations in 2025

In addition, SMUD completed several efforts in 2024 to reduce the impact of risk in the areas of reliability, safety and supply chain. Highlights of those efforts are provided below.
<!-- Page 18 -->
![Contractor Code of Conduct](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Contractor Code of Conduct**  
In 2024, staff implemented a new Contractor Code of Conduct to help mitigate supply chain risk and continue providing a safe, reliable and sustainable grid for the future. The Code of Conduct outlines how staff will recruit contractors – and their employees and subcontractors – who share SMUD’s vision. With their collaboration, SMUD is aiming to create a supply chain that collectively contributes to building a greener, more sustainable future. The Code of Conduct outlines specific guidelines that ensure compliance with; laws, rules and regulations, labor and human rights, environmental and social, health and safety, diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, and ethics and compliance.

**CrowdStrike Response**  
In July 2024, SMUD was one of many entities affected by a worldwide CrowdStrike information technology (IT) outage, which impacted Microsoft Windows applications. Staff acted promptly to alert support teams and communicate the cause and the solution. IT teams moved swiftly, prioritizing our most important systems and working through the night to bring systems back online. Due to our internal teams’ hard work and dedication, systems were back online quickly, and we were fully recovered in a matter of days, without having to pay for external recovery specialist services. The incident demonstrated the successful operation of our controls around business continuity, which is an Enterprise Risk.

**Storm Response Team**  
For a second year in a row, extreme weather interrupted power to thousands of SMUD customers as strong winds persisted for several hours in February 2024. However, preparations conducted over the prior year significantly improved our speed of restoration and accuracy of estimated restoration times. SMUD was able to provide customers with new status information, letting them know when crews were scheduled to restore their power and when crews arrived on site. More staff was placed in the field by leveraging pre-existing contracts, training meter and substation staff to respond to damage reports and calling on retired annuitants. We used new technologies and processes to synthesize the data coming back to rapidly build a restoration schedule and were able to track and beat the schedule over the recovery period. This storm provided a first test of the improvements we implemented last year and showed significant impact to our customers' experiences. We will continue to build on these successes and iteratively enhance the processes for next year.

**Supply Chain Enhancements**  
Several enhancements were completed in 2024 to reduce the impact of supply chain shortages on SMUD’s operations. Staff held regular recurring business review and demand planning meetings across several operational areas primarily focused on construction, material, and equipment contractors. Staff also implemented two multi-million bulk purchasing efforts, the first to bring on additional substation resources at 200 million and the second to decrease the cost and lead times of transformers at 250 million.

**Insurance Recovery**  
To mitigate the financial impact of business disruption risks such as asset outages, SMUD has commercial insurance policies. In 2024, SMUD completed collections on two large insurance claims. We received final settlement of the Consumers Power Plant (CPP) business interruption claim resulting in recovery of an additional $88.9 million in 2024, for a total claim recovery of $152 million (equipment loss and business interruption). This year SMUD also finished collecting the $7.5 million insurance payout for the Station A fire in 2021. These funds offset prior costs and will support lower rate increases going forward.

**B. Benchmarking**

North Carolina State University’s (NCSU) Enterprise Risk Management Initiative and Protiviti continue to jointly publish benchmark information. The joint study, 2024 & 2034 Executive Perspectives on Top Risks, provides insight for short-term and long-term risks from 1,443 global board members and executives from across several industries.

Overall, the study found that risks are becoming increasingly interrelated and pose significant challenges to current business models and the ability of modern organizations to be resilient and agile. As the risks associated with the pandemic subside, concerns around several emerging risks and uncertainty in the world is causing risk exposure to rise. Today’s executive concerns continue to be focused on cybersecurity, third-party, talent and workforce management, and political and economic uncertainty, but the emerging risks associated with disruptive technologies, climate change, and regulatory changes are changing how risk is managed. Specific to the energy and utility industry, executives are more focused on the operational risks around cybersecurity, supply chain and weather-related risks, but found that their organizations were becoming more adaptable and better able to respond to events. In addition to operational concerns, the risks associated with regulatory and legislative changes ranked high for energy and utility leaders. Attachment B compares SMUD’s top enterprise risks to the top 10 Energy and Utility risks identified in NCSU and Protiviti study.

**C. Risk Focus Areas & Global Risk Trends**

As described in last year’s SD-17 Annual Report, SMUD leaders selected 16 risk focus areas in 2023. Risk focus areas have a high potential to impact the achievement of SMUD’s goals and strategic objectives in the upcoming year and are therefore areas of emphasis for our risk committees and investment decisions. This year, SMUD added two risks, Changing Customer Expectations and Grid Infrastructure and Operational Adequacy, for a total of 18 risk focus areas.

Attachment A outlines each risk focus area and the actions that have been taken to address these risks. Provided below is a synopsis of increasing global risk since the 2023 Board update that may cause risk focus areas to trend upward. These changes are also examples of the type of information tracked and reported by SMUD’s risk management functions.

Global risk trends impacting SMUD’s 2023-2024 risk focus areas:

- **Political and Regulatory Uncertainty:** There are potential effects of the upcoming November elections on the energy industry, specifically related to grant funding and regulation changes. Moreover, at the State level there are ever-evolving regulations as California manages the energy transition. This creates a level of uncertainty that deserves attention. Reliably delivering zero carbon power in an increasingly interconnected energy landscape will require coordination and collaboration between federal and state policy makers, regulators, owners, and operators.

- **Climate Change and Severe Weather:** Climate change continues to pose some of the biggest areas of uncertainty. Four characteristics make it especially impactful amongst other risks. That is its global nature, its long-term consequences, the fact that it is potentially irreversible, and the almost overwhelming uncertainty surrounding its progression and effects.

- **Third-Party and Supply Chain Risk:** Uncertainty around supply chain issues in the energy and utility industry has diminished since its peak during the pandemic. However, concerns remain high given how the energy industry’s value chain is highly service, feedstock, parts, and equipment oriented. Disruptions related to global events such as...

geopolitical tensions or labor strikes at the Ports threaten to inhibit a utility’s ability to secure the equipment needed to maintain existing and build new infrastructure. Additionally, there is risk in testing new business models working with untested partners as the grid is modernized.

- **Physical and Cybersecurity Threats:** An increasingly modernized grid creates a larger physical and digital footprint, which in turn elevates exposure to physical and cybersecurity threats. On a national scale, there are an increasing number of reports of both physical and cybersecurity attacks against utilities from domestic terrorists. Lastly, while the recent acceleration of artificial intelligence provides prospective benefits, it also likely adds another dimension for use by bad actors.
  
- **Changing Customer Expectations:** Customer preferences are changing at a faster rate than they have in the past due to the prevalence of social media and more granular segmentation data. Additionally, customers continue to be impacted by the inflationary pressures introduced during the pandemic, which can increase energy bill burden, especially for certain communities. Lastly, as technological advances continue to accelerate, organizations are under more and more pressure to meet customers’ evolving needs.

Staff reviews available enterprise risk-related information, including global risk trends such as those above, and incorporates new risk issues and/or expands existing risk issues where appropriate.

**D. Looking forward**

In 2025, ERM will work with leaders to refresh the enterprise risk management framework. The refreshed framework will include improvements in standardization, prioritization, aggregation and interconnectedness of risks as recommended by KPMG. Included in the refreshed framework will also be a discussion of emerging risks impacting the organization.

**4. Challenges**

Today’s risk environment is increasingly becoming more complex, interconnected and crisis-driven. How we manage risk will need to evolve in response. As we refresh the enterprise risk management framework, we will be challenged to look holistically across the organization to identify and mitigate risk cross-functionally. Moving to an approach that identifies and manages risk both from a top-down and bottom-up perspective will improve risk governance across the enterprise, our ability to identify and manage emerging risks, and provide management with improved quantitative tools to make resource decisions.

**5. Recommendation**

It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-17, Enterprise Risk Management.

|---------------|------|----------------------|------------|--------|--------------------------|
| External      | Severe weather (incl wind, heat, lightning, capacity) | ⚪ ⚪ ⚪ | ➔ | ⚪ | Climate change increases the frequency, intensity, and impacts of extreme weather events. These impacts have a high potential to impact SMUD’s goals and operations. SMUD has conducted lessons learned after events and used those lessons to make process changes and plan for future events. Staff continues to conduct tabletop exercises for a number of hazard events such as storms, wildfires, heat waves, and gas pipeline to name a few. Doing so helps SMUD proactively identify gaps and address them, preparing SMUD for future events. |
| Operational: People | Strategic workforce planning: critical positions | ⚪ ⚪ ⚪ | ➔ | 🟢 | Staff conduct a bi-annual enterprise-wide role analysis to anticipate and mitigate risks of near-term and future workforce gaps. SMUD’s Organizational Effectiveness team facilitates the strategic workforce planning program, enabling senior leaders and team members to analyze workforce data and consider several criteria to identify key roles, including impact on strategy, turnover, cost of turnover, level of effort to backfill, operational impact, customer service impact, and performance variability. <br> In Q2 2024 we identified 7% of SMUD roles, or 57 total, as key roles and documented the rationale for selection as key. In Q3 we developed action plans to address workforce gaps in key roles. <br> Action plans encompass 79 different solutions to mitigate current and future risks associated with the key roles. Action plans range in complexity – some are relatively simple where a role has a single incumbent and requires knowledge transfer and cross training. Action plans can be much more complex. For example, in 2023 SMUD launched a robust Field Leader Program to address challenges in the transition from field to office. Action plans may identify the need for a new role. For example, in Energy Trading and Contracts, we’re developing a new Market Performance Analytics role to help address the increased volatility of commodities markets. |

| Operational: Process   | Supply chain | 2022                 | 🟡         | 🟡      | While senior leadership drives the action plans, completing them involves support from Compensation & Classification, Talent Management, Labor Relations, Career Development & Learning and Regional Workforce Development teams. The Organizational Effectiveness team monitors progress and reports on the status of action plans quarterly. Due to the action plans being strategic and long-range in nature, staff will continue to facilitate progress and tracking through 2025. Also in 2025, staff will ask senior leaders to identify significant changes that requires reassessing key roles. The supply chain risk management program matured in 2024. Staff held regular recurring business review and demand planning meetings across several operational areas primarily focused on construction, material, and equipment contractors, including line transmission and distribution, substations, material planning, fleet, power generation, and facilities. These meetings were expanded to include additional areas with professional service and technology contractors during 2024. Staff established bulk purchasing agreements, new business service levels and replacement stock to reduce costs and lead procurement times. While efforts to mitigate this risk have improved operations, the risk trend is still increasing due to the considerable demand on transformers nationally and the amount needed by SMUD to meet regional growth and maintain a safety inventory. In 2024 and beyond, an opportunity area to focus on is third party risk management, in particular spending time managing performance and critical third-party relationships across all categories. Staff has developed updated solicitation and contract information including updated performance scorecards and procedures to support this effort. Supply chain staff recommends involving senior leadership in this process for the top services measured by spend and criticality annually. |

| Strategic     | Transportation sector electrification/Unmanaged electrification | 2022                 | ⚪          |        | SMUD has investigated the question of what electrification of buildings and transport will do to our grid for more than a decade. We continually improve our assessment approach as new data, forecasts, and technology change. This assessment process helps us plan for expected growth in a manageable way, to reduce the risk of us delaying connection of new electric loads. In addition, the assessment enables us to have a clear picture of the potential impacts in an unmanaged and a managed world. Mitigations implemented in 2024 include: <ul><li>"Call SMUD First" campaign which is driving conversations earlier between SMUD and the customer to help support infrastructure planning.</li><li>Geospatial map where we have clusters of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption aligned with overloaded transformers to help prioritize where infrastructure upgrades may need to be made.</li><li>Work with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) through their EV2Scale2030 initiative to utilize their tools and help support more standardization of processes across utilities.</li><li>Panel and grid innovation opportunities to support more electrification while optimizing grid and customer infrastructure investments.</li></ul> |

# RESOLUTION NO. 24-11-04

WHEREAS, Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) codification section Re10 Regulated Operations allows the deferral of operating revenues from the current period to a future period as a regulatory liability for rate-making purposes; and

WHEREAS, this deferral will i) help offset $20 million of future Community Impact Plan expenditures through 2028 and is in line with the plan to offset additional 2030 Zero Carbon Plan spending for pilots and programs, ii) use $60 million for future unplanned increases in Commodity expenditures through 2030 that will have a negative impact to net income and provide reserves to cover large fluctuations in the commodity market that may have a significant financial impact on SMUD, and iii) help offset $41 million of onetime expenditures not identified during the annual budget process; and

WHEREAS, the deferral will help mitigate risks that may occur from unforeseen or onetime events that may have a significant financial impact on SMUD, such as, but not limited to, catastrophic events, wildfire costs, and additional 2030 Zero Carbon Plan expenditures; and

WHEREAS, providing reserves should leveling out the impact of future cost increases on ratepayers; and

WHEREAS, standard or default accounting practices would be to recognize the revenues and expenses in the accounting period incurred; and

WHEREAS, pursuant to GASB codification section Re10 Regulated Operations, for ratemaking purposes, it would be appropriate to match the expenses with the revenues so that the revenue is recognized in the same period in which the amount is expended and will, therefore, more accurately reflect revenues and expenses in the same period; NOW, THEREFORE,

BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:

That this Board authorizes SMUD’s Accountant to defer recognition of $121 million of 2024 operating revenues to offset the following: 1) $20 million future Community Impact Plan expenditures through 2028; 2) $60 million for

3.11 California Renewables Portfolio Standard. Upon request of Buyer, Seller shall provide records or other information reasonably required to demonstrate that the Product has been conveyed and delivered in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, subject to Section 3.12, scheduling or delivery information necessary to meet the requirements of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard for the Product.

(“Compliance Expenditure Cap”)

(a) CEC Certification and Verification;

(b) Green Attributes;

(c) WREGIS; and

(d) Capacity Attributes.

Any actions required for Seller to comply with its obligations set forth in the first paragraph above, the cost of which will be included in the Compliance Expenditure Cap, shall be referred to collectively as the “Compliance Actions.”

Buyer will have ninety (90) days to evaluate such Notice (during which time period Seller is not obligated to take any Compliance Actions described in the Notice) and shall, within such time, either (1) agree to reimburse Seller for all or some portion of the costs that exceed the Compliance Expenditure Cap (such Buyer-agreed upon costs, the “Accepted Compliance Costs”), or (2) waive Seller’s obligation to take such Compliance Actions, or any part thereof, for which Buyer has not agreed to reimburse Seller.

subject of the Notice, and Seller shall have no further obligations to take, and no liability for a failure to take, such Compliance Actions for the remainder of the Term

; provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right to reconsider Compliance Actions that have been rejected or waived pursuant to this paragraph at any time; provided further, upon Buyer’s written request in connection with such reconsideration, Seller shall provide Notice to Buyer with an updated estimate of the anticipated out-of-pocket expenses to take the reconsidered Compliance Action. Within ninety (90) days after Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s Notice, Buyer shall agree to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs or waive Seller’s obligation to take the reconsidered Compliance Actions, or any part thereof, for which Buyer does not agree to reimburse Seller; provided, if Buyer does not reply within such ninety (90) day period Buyer shall be deemed to have waived Seller’s obligation to take such Compliance Actions.

If Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs, then Seller shall take such Compliance Actions covered by the Accepted Compliance Costs as agreed upon by Buyer and Buyer shall reimburse Seller for Seller’s actual costs to effectuate the Compliance Actions, not to exceed the Accepted Compliance Costs, within sixty (60) days from the time that Buyer receives an invoice and documentation of such costs from Seller. If Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs for less than all of the costs that exceed the Compliance Expenditure Cap, Seller shall only be obligated to take the Compliance Actions covered by the Accepted Compliance Costs.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, any increases in Seller in excess of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000) per year to comply with requirements regarding Capacity Attributes (including Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity) established by Buyer, or any Person vested with the authority under applicable Law to require Buyer to procure resource adequacy or other such products, over and above Seller’s costs to comply with CAISO and/or CPUC requirements as to Resource Adequacy Benefits as of the Effective Date (“Buyer Capacity Compliance Costs”), shall be excluded from the Compliance Expenditure Cap. If Buyer desires Seller to comply with any requirements regarding Capacity Attributes (including Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity) that differ from CAISO and/or CPUC requirements as described in the prior sentence, Buyer shall be responsible for payment of all such Buyer Capacity Compliance Costs.

The terms and conditions of this Section 3.12 with respect to Seller expenses in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to all Buyer Capacity Compliance Costs.

Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement: (i) Seller shall be under no obligation to take any action to comply with such requirements as could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact upon Seller’s ability to own, operate, or maintain the Facility; and (ii) if at any time, pursuant to (a) the then-current CAISO Tariff, (b) the rules or regulations of Buyer or any Person vested with the authority under applicable Law to require Buyer to procure resource adequacy or other such products, or (c) other applicable Law, the transfer and/or delivery to Buyer of Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity associated with the Facility is not permitted, then: Seller shall have no further obligation hereunder to deliver Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity to Buyer; Seller shall not be required to incur any costs or expenses in connection with delivery of Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity to Buyer; such non-delivery of Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity to Buyer:

<!-- Page 73 -->
(e) A “WREGIS Certificate Deficit” means any deficit or shortfall in WREGIS Certificates delivered to Buyer for a calendar month as compared to the Delivered Energy for the same calendar month (“Deficient Month”). If any WREGIS Certificate Deficit is caused, or the result of any action or inaction, by Seller, then the amount of Delivered Energy in the Deficient Month shall be reduced on a pro rata basis across all Settlement Periods in such Deficient Month by the amount of the WREGIS Certificate Deficit for purposes of calculating Buyer’s payment to Seller under Article 8 and the Guaranteed Energy Production for the applicable Performance Measurement Period; provided, however, that such adjustment shall not apply to the extent that after the ninety (90) days attributed to the delay in the creation of WREGIS Certificates for such Deficient Month, Seller either (x) resolves the WREGIS Certificate Deficit within an additional one hundred eighty (180) days or (y) provides Replacement Green Attributes within an additional one hundred eighty (180) days (i) upon a schedule reasonably acceptable to Buyer and (ii) provided that such deliveries do not impose additional costs upon Buyer for which Seller refuses to provide reimbursement. If the amount of Delivered Energy in the Deficient Month is reduced in accordance with the prior sentence and neither (x) nor (y) of the prior sentence apply, Buyer shall pay Seller for any Delivered Energy that is delivered by Seller without corresponding WREGIS Certificates at a price equal to the lesser of (i) the Contract Price, or (ii) the LMP in the Day-Ahead Market at the Delivery Point, and for purposes of the Guaranteed Energy Production, Delivered Energy is reduced by the amount of the WREGIS Certificate Deficit for the applicable Performance Measurement Period. Without limiting Seller’s obligations under this Section 4.8, if a WREGIS Certificate Deficit is caused solely by an error or omission of WREGIS, Delivered Energy shall not be reduced pursuant to this Section 4.8(e) and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to cause WREGIS to correct its error or omission.

(f) If WREGIS changes the WREGIS Operating Rules after the Effective Date or applies the WREGIS Operating Rules in a manner inconsistent with this Section 4.8 after the Effective Date, the Parties promptly shall modify this Section 4.8 as reasonably required to cause and enable Seller to transfer to Buyer’s WREGIS Account a quantity of WREGIS Certificates for each given calendar month that corresponds to the Delivered Energy in the same calendar month.

4.9 Standard of Care. Seller shall be responsible for designing, installing, operating, and maintaining the Facility (including all associated costs) in accordance with all applicable Law, and shall comply with all applicable WECC, RC West, FERC and NERC requirements, and with Prudent Operating Practice, including applicable interconnection and telemetering requirements set forth in the Interconnection Agreement.

Seller shall ensure that: (a) operation and maintenance of the Project is conducted in a safe manner in accordance with the Interconnection Agreement and Prudent Industry Practice; and (b) any governmental authorizations and permits required for the operation thereof are maintained. Consistent with (a) above, Seller shall ensure that any necessary and commercially reasonable repairs are made to the Facility.

Seller acknowledges receipt of SMUD’s Principles of Renewable Energy Development as expressed in Exhibit M, attached and incorporated herein. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to abide by the project-specific obligations identified in the “Communities Benefits Plan” as further described in Exhibit M, to the extent applicable to and feasible for the Facility as reasonably determined by Seller.

# ARTICLE 5  
## TAXES  

5.1 **Allocation of Taxes and Charges.** Seller shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the Facility or on or with respect to the sale and delivery of Product to Buyer, that are imposed on Product prior to the Delivery Point. Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes on or with respect to the delivery to and purchase by Buyer of the Product that are imposed on Product at and from the Delivery Point (other than withholding or other Taxes imposed on Seller’s income, revenue, receipts or employees). If a Party is required to remit or pay Taxes that are the other Party’s responsibility hereunder, such Party shall promptly pay the Taxes due and then seek and receive reimbursement from the other for such Taxes. In the event any sale of Product hereunder is exempt from or not subject to any particular Tax, the exempted Party shall provide the other Party with all necessary documentation within thirty (30) days after the Effective Date to evidence such exemption or exclusion. If the exempted Party does not provide such documentation, then such Party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other Party from any liability with respect to Taxes from which the exempted Party claims it is exempt.  

5.2 **Cooperation.** Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to implement the provisions of and administer this Agreement in accordance with the intent of the Parties to minimize all Taxes, so long as no Party is materially adversely affected by such efforts. The Parties shall cooperate to minimize Tax exposure; provided, however, that neither Party shall be obligated to incur any financial or operational burden to reduce Taxes for which the other Party is responsible hereunder without receiving due compensation therefor from the other Party. All Energy delivered by Seller to Buyer hereunder shall be a sale made at wholesale, with Buyer reselling such Energy.  

# ARTICLE 6  
## MAINTENANCE OF THE FACILITY  

6.1 **Maintenance of the Facility.** Seller shall comply with Law and Prudent Operating Practice relating to the operation and maintenance of the Facility and the generation and sale of Product.  

6.2 **Maintenance of Health and Safety.** Seller shall take reasonable safety precautions with respect to the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the Facility. If Seller becomes aware of any circumstances relating to the Facility that create an imminent risk of damage or injury to any Person or any Person’s property, Seller shall take prompt, reasonable action to prevent such damage or injury and shall give Buyer’s emergency contact identified on Exhibit K Notice of such condition. Such action may include disconnecting and removing all or a portion of the Facility, or suspending the supply of Energy to Buyer.  

6.3 **Shared Facilities.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain of the Interconnection Facilities, Seller’s rights and obligations under the Interconnection Agreement and Seller’s rights and obligations under transmission service agreements with a Transmission Provider, may at some point be subject to certain shared facilities and/or co-tenancy agreements (“Shared Facilities Agreements”) to be entered into among two or more of Seller, the Participating Transmission Owner, Seller’s Affiliates, and/or third parties pursuant to which

**ARTICLE 7  
METERING**

7.1 **Metering.** Seller shall measure the amount of Delivered Energy produced by the Facility using an Approved Meter. The Approved Meter shall be installed at the switching station PG&E’s Pit #3 – Round Mountain 230 kV Line and maintained at Seller’s cost. If the Approved Meter is inaccurate, Seller will cause such meter to be promptly corrected in accordance with Prudent Operating Practice and CAISO requirements. Seller will be responsible for any costs, fines or penalties, including imbalance charges as a result of the inaccurate meter. The meter shall be kept under seal, such seals to be broken only when the meters are to be tested, adjusted, modified or relocated. In the event that Seller breaks a seal, Seller shall notify Buyer as soon as practicable. In addition, Seller hereby agrees to provide all Approved Meter data to Buyer in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and consents to Buyer obtaining from CAISO the meter data applicable to the Facility and all inspection, testing and calibration data and reports. Seller, or Seller’s Scheduling Coordinator, shall cooperate with Buyer to allow both Parties to retrieve the meter reads from the CAISO Market Results Interface – Settlements (MRIS-S) (or its successor).

7.2 **Meter Verification.** Annually, if Seller has reason to believe there may be a meter malfunction, or upon Buyer’s reasonable request, Seller shall test the meter. The tests shall be conducted by independent third parties qualified to conduct such tests at Seller’s expense; provided, if the meter is tested at Buyer’s request and is determined to be accurate, the costs of such test shall be borne by Buyer. If practical, Buyer shall be notified seven (7) days in advance of such tests and have a right to be present during such tests. If a meter is inaccurate it shall be promptly repaired or replaced. If a meter is inaccurate by more than one percent (1%) and it is not known when the meter inaccuracy commenced (if such evidence exists such date will be used to adjust prior invoices), then the invoices covering the period of time since the last meter test shall be adjusted for the amount of the inaccuracy on the assumption that the inaccuracy persisted during the second half of such period.

**ARTICLE 8  
INVOICING AND PAYMENT; CREDIT**

8.1 **Invoicing.** Seller shall deliver an invoice to Buyer no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the prior monthly delivery period; provided that Seller’s failure to deliver an invoice to Buyer by such deadline shall not be a breach hereunder. Each invoice shall provide Buyer (a) records of metered data, including metering and CAISO transaction data sufficient to document and verify the amount of Delivered Energy for each Settlement Period during the preceding month, including the amount of Delivered Energy as set forth in the first CAISO settlement statement for the prior month that includes meter data from the Approved Meter, the applicable Contract Price, deviations between the Scheduled Energy and the Delivered Energy, the LMP in the Real-Time Market at the Delivery Point for each Settlement Period; (b) hourly meter data, plus any additional data as may be reasonably required by Buyer for compliance with CPUC reporting obligations, including pursuant to the CPUC’s Energy Division Portfolio Content Category Classification Review Handbook (or successor publication); (c) a statement of

the quantity of WREGIS Certificates transferred during the prior month; (d) access to any records, including invoices or settlement data from the CAISO, necessary to verify the accuracy of any amount; and (e) be in a reasonable format covering the services provided in the preceding month determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

8.2 Payment. Buyer shall make payment to Seller by wire transfer or ACH payment to the bank account provided on each monthly invoice. Buyer shall pay undisputed invoice amounts within thirty (30) days after receipt of the invoice. If such due date falls on a weekend, local business holiday observed by either Party, or a NERC holiday, such due date shall be the next Business Day. Payments made after the due date will be considered late and will bear interest on the unpaid balance. If the amount due is not paid on or before the due date or if any other payment that is due and owing from one party to another is not paid on or before its applicable due date, a late payment charge shall be applied to the unpaid balance and shall be added to the next billing statement. Such late payment charge shall be calculated based on an annual Interest Rate equal to the prime rate published on the date of the invoice in The Wall Street Journal (or, if The Wall Street Journal is not published on that day, the next succeeding date of publication), plus two percent (2%) (the “Interest Rate”). If the due date occurs on a day that is not a Business Day, the late payment charge shall begin to accrue on the next succeeding Business Day.

8.3 Books and Records. To facilitate payment and verification, each Party shall maintain all books and records necessary for billing and payments, including copies of all invoices under this Agreement, for a period of at least two (2) years or as otherwise required by Law. Upon fifteen (15) days’ Notice to Seller, Buyer shall be granted reasonable access to the accounting books and records pertaining to all invoices generated pursuant to this Agreement.

8.4 Payment Adjustments; Billing Errors. Payment adjustments shall be made if Buyer or Seller discovers there have been good faith inaccuracies in invoicing that are not otherwise disputed under Section 8.5, there is determined to have been a meter inaccuracy sufficient to require a payment adjustment, or if CAISO recalculates amounts due or owing in respect of prior periods. If the required adjustment is in favor of Buyer, Buyer’s monthly payment shall be credited in an amount equal to the adjustment. If the required adjustment is in favor of Seller, Seller shall add the adjustment amount to Buyer’s next monthly invoice. Other than recalculations by CAISO, adjustments in favor of either Buyer or Seller shall bear interest, until settled in full, in accordance with Section 8.2, accruing from the date on which the non-erring Party received Notice thereof.

8.5 Billing Disputes. A Party may, in good faith, dispute the correctness of any invoice or any adjustment to an invoice rendered under this Agreement or adjust any invoice for any arithmetic or computational error within twelve (12) months of the date the invoice, or adjustment to an invoice, was rendered. In the event an invoice or portion thereof, or any other claim or adjustment arising hereunder, is disputed, payment of the undisputed portion of the invoice shall be required to be made when due. Any invoice dispute or invoice adjustment shall be in writing and shall state the basis for the dispute or adjustment. Payment of the disputed amount shall not be required until the dispute is resolved. Upon resolution of the dispute, any required payment shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of such resolution along with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the original due date to but excluding the date paid. Inadvertent overpayments shall be returned upon request or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment.

from subsequent payments, with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the date of such overpayment but excluding the date repaid or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment. Any dispute with respect to an invoice is waived if the other Party is not notified in accordance with this Section 8.5 within twelve (12) months after the invoice is rendered or subsequently adjusted, except to the extent any misinformation was from a third party not affiliated with any Party and such third party corrects its information after the twelve-month period. If an invoice is not rendered within twelve (12) months after the close of the month during which performance occurred, the right to payment for such performance is waived.

8.6 Netting of Payments. The Parties hereby agree that they shall discharge mutual debts and payment obligations due and owing to each other on the same date through netting, in which case all undisputed amounts owed by each Party to the other Party for the purchase and sale of Product during the monthly billing period under this Agreement or otherwise arising out of this Agreement, including any related damages calculated pursuant to Exhibits B and E, interest, and payments or credits, including pursuant to Section 4.3(c), shall be netted so that only the excess amount remaining due shall be paid by the Party who owes the remaining amount.

8.7 Seller’s Pre-CSD Security. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall deliver Pre-CSD Security to Buyer within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date. Seller shall maintain the Pre-CSD Security in full force and effect. Upon the earlier of (A) Seller’s delivery of the Performance Security, or (B) sixty (60) days after termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall return the Pre-CSD Security to Seller, less the amounts drawn in accordance with this Agreement. If and to the extent that the performance of the Pre-CSD Security is terminated by the issuer of such Letter of Credit (i) fails to maintain a Credit Rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s, (ii) indicates its intent not to renew such Letter of Credit and such Credit expires prior to Contract Start Date, (iii) fails to honor Buyer’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit, or (iv) becomes Bankrupt, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to post substitute collateral that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Pre-CSD Security. Seller shall have no obligation to replenish the Pre-CSD Security following any draws thereon by Buyer. Seller’s maximum liability for an Event of Default or failure to perform its obligations hereunder prior to the Contract Start Date shall be capped at the amount of the Pre-CSD Security, less any amounts collected by Buyer prior to such Event of Default or failure to perform.

8.8 Seller’s Performance Security. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall deliver Performance Security to Buyer on or before the Contract Start Date. Seller shall maintain the Performance Security in full force and effect until the following have occurred: (A) the Delivery Term has expired or terminated early; and (B) all payment obligations of the Seller arising under this Agreement, including compensation for penalties, Termination Payment, indemnification payments or other damages are paid in full (whether directly or indirectly such as through set-off or netting). Following the occurrence of both events, Buyer shall promptly return to Seller the unused portion of the Performance Security. If and to the extent that any portion of the Performance Security is a Letter of Credit and the issuer of such Letter of Credit (i) fails to maintain a Credit Rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s, (ii) fails to honor Buyer’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit, or (iii) becomes Bankrupt, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to post substitute collateral that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Performance Security.

8.9 Financial Statements.

(a) If requested, Buyer shall provide to Seller (i) within one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of each fiscal year during the Contract Term, a copy of Buyer’s annual report containing audited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal year and (ii) within sixty (60) days after the end of each of its first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year during the Contract Term, a copy of Buyer’s quarterly report containing unaudited consolidated financial statements for such fiscal quarter. In all cases the statements shall be for the most recent accounting period and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”); provided, however, that should any such statements not be available on a timely basis due to a delay in preparation or certifications, such unavailability shall not be an Event of Default so long as Buyer diligently pursues the preparation, certification, and delivery of the statements.

8.10 Buyer’s First Priority Security Interest in Cash or Cash Equivalent Collateral. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, and until released as provided herein, Seller hereby grants to Buyer a present and continuing first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), and assignment of the Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, any other cash collateral and cash equivalent collateral posted by Seller pursuant to Sections 8.7 and 8.8, and any and all interest thereon or proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof, whether now or hereafter held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of Buyer, and Seller agrees to take all action as Buyer reasonably requires in order to perfect Buyer’s first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), such collateral and any and all proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof.

Upon or any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default caused by Seller, an Early Termination Date resulting from an Event of Default caused by Seller, or an occasion provided for in this Agreement where Buyer is authorized to retain all or a portion of the Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, Buyer may do any one or more of the following (in each case subject to the final sentence of this Section 8.10 and the provisions of Article 12):

(a) Exercise any of its rights and remedies with respect to the Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, as applicable, including any such rights and remedies under Law then in effect;

(b) Draw on any outstanding Letter of Credit issued for its benefit and retain any cash held by Buyer as Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, as applicable; and

(c) Liquidate all Pre-CSD Security or Performance Security, as applicable then held by or for the benefit of Buyer free from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of Seller, including any equity or right of purchase or redemption by Seller.

Buyer shall apply the proceeds of the collateral realized upon the exercise of any such rights or remedies to reduce Seller’s obligations under this Agreement (Seller remains liable for any amounts owing to Buyer after such application), subject to Buyer’s obligation to return any surplus proceeds remaining after these obligations are satisfied in full.

### 10.1 Definition.
(a) “Force Majeure Event” means any act or event that delays or prevents a Party from timely performing all or a portion of its obligations under this Agreement or from complying with all or a portion of the conditions under this Agreement if such act or event, which event or circumstance, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, cannot be avoided by and is beyond the reasonable control (whether direct or indirect) of and without the fault or negligence of the Party relying thereon as justification for such delay, nonperformance or noncompliance.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, so long as the following events, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, cannot be avoided by, and are beyond the reasonable control (whether direct or indirect) of and without the fault or negligence of the Party relying thereon as justification for such delay, nonperformance or noncompliance, a Force Majeure Event may include an act of God or the elements, such as flooding, lightning, hurricanes, tornadoes, or ice storms; explosion; fire; volcanic eruption; flood; epidemic, or pandemic, including COVID-19 (but only to the extent that new governmental rules or mandates related to COVID-19 are implemented that were not in place as of the Effective Date); landslide; mudslide; sabotage; terrorism; earthquake; or other cataclysmic events; an act of public enemy; acts or failure to act by a Governmental Authority; war; blockade; civil insurrection; riot; civil disturbance; Serial Defect; or strikes or other labor difficulties caused or suffered by a Party or any third party except as set forth below.

<!-- Page 80 -->
(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Force Majeure Event” does not include (i) economic conditions that render a Party’s performance of this Agreement at the Contract Price unprofitable or otherwise uneconomic (including Buyer’s ability to buy Energy at a lower price, or Seller’s ability to sell Energy generated by the Facility at a higher price, than the Contract Price); (ii) Seller’s inability to obtain permits or approvals of any type for the construction, operation, or maintenance of the Facility, except to the extent such inability is caused by a Force Majeure Event; (iii) the inability of a Party to make payments when due under this Agreement; (iv) a Curtailment Order, except to the extent that a Curtailment Order is caused by an event that otherwise qualifies as a Force Majeure Event; (v) Seller’s inability to obtain sufficient labor, equipment, materials, or other resources to build or operate the Facility except to the extent such inability is caused by a Force Majeure Event; (vi) a strike, work stoppage or labor dispute limited only to any one or more of Seller, Seller’s Affiliates, Seller’s contractors, their subcontractors thereof or any other third party employed by Seller to work on the Facility; (vii) any equipment failure except if such equipment failure is caused by a Force Majeure Event; or (viii) except as the Guaranteed Contract Start Date may be extended as a result of a Permitted Extension, Seller’s inability to achieve Contract Start Date following the Guaranteed Contract Start Date.

10.2 No Liability If a Force Majeure Event Occurs. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall be liable to the other Party in the event it is prevented from performing its obligations hereunder in whole or in part due to a Force Majeure Event. The Party rendered unable to fulfill any obligation by reason of a Force Majeure Event shall take reasonable actions necessary to remove such inability with due speed and diligence. Nothing herein shall be construed to permit a Party to continue to fail to perform after said cause has been removed. The obligation to use due speed and diligence shall not be interpreted to require resolution of labor disputes by acceding to demands of the opposition when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the Party having such difficulty. Neither Party shall be considered in breach or default of this Agreement if and to the extent that any failure or delay in the Party’s performance of one or more of its obligations hereunder is caused by a Force Majeure Event. The occurrence and continuation of a Force Majeure Event shall not suspend or excuse the obligation of a Party to make any payments due hereunder. Any delays caused by a Force Majeure Event will not serve to increase the Contract Term nor Contract Price of this Agreement.

10.3 Notice. In the event of any delay or nonperformance resulting from a Force Majeure Event, the Party suffering the Force Majeure Event shall (a) as soon as practicable, notify the other Party in writing of the nature, cause, estimated date of commencement thereof, the anticipated extent of any delay or interruption in performance, and, to the extent reasonably practicable, a mitigation plan for limiting or overcoming the impacts of the Force Majeure Event and (b) notify the other Party in writing of the cessation or termination of such Force Majeure Event, all as known or estimated in good faith by the affected Party; provided, however, that a Party’s failure to give timely Notice as provided in this Section 10.3 shall not affect such Party’s ability to assert that a Force Majeure Event has occurred unless the delay in giving Notice materially prejudices the other Party.

10.4 Termination Following Force Majeure Event. If a Force Majeure Event has occurred after the Contract Start Date that has caused either Party to be unable to perform its material obligations hereunder, and has continued for a consecutive twelve (12) month period, then the -39-
<!-- Page 81 -->

the non-claiming Party may terminate this Agreement upon Notice to the other Party experiencing the Force Majeure Event; provided that if Seller is the Party claiming such Force Majeure Event and such Force Majeure Event cannot reasonably be cured within such twelve (12) month period, then Seller may provide a plan to Buyer, which must be acceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion, to cure such Force Majeure Event within an additional consecutive six (6) month period and Buyer may not terminate this Agreement due to such Force Majeure Event unless Seller has not resumed performance of its material obligations hereunder upon the expiration of such additional consecutive six (6) month period. Upon any such termination, the non-claiming Party shall have no liability to the Party claiming Force Majeure Event, save and except for those obligations specified in Section 2.1(b).

**ARTICLE 11**  
**DEFAULTS; REMEDIES; TERMINATION**

11.1 **Events of Default.** An “Event of Default” shall mean,

(vii) such Party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to, another entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer, the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume all the obligations of such Party under this Agreement by operation of Law or pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the other Party.

(b) with respect to Seller as the Defaulting Party, the occurrence of any of the following:

(i) except as otherwise provided herein, if at any time, Seller delivers or attempts to deliver Energy to the Delivery Point for sale under this Agreement that was not generated by the Facility; or

(ii) with respect to any outstanding Letter of Credit provided for the benefit of Buyer that is not then required under this Agreement to be canceled or returned, the failure by Seller to provide for the benefit of Buyer either (1) cash, or (2) a replacement surety bond (solely with respect to the Performance Security), or (3) a substitute Letter of Credit from a different issuer meeting the criteria set forth in the definition of Letter of Credit, in each case, in the amount required hereunder within ten (10) Business Days after Seller receives Notice of the occurrence of any of the following events:

(B) the issuer of such Letter of Credit becomes Bankrupt;

(a) to send Notice, designating a day, no earlier than the day such Notice is deemed to be received and no later than twenty (20) days after such Notice is deemed to be received, as an early termination date of this Agreement (“Early Termination Date”) that terminates this Agreement (the “Terminated Transaction”) and ends the Contract Term effective as of the Early Termination Date;

(b) to accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties, and to collect as liquidated damages (i) the Damage Payment (in the case of an Event of Default by Seller occurring before the Contract Start Date) or (ii) the Termination Payment calculated in accordance with Section 11.3 below (in the case of any other Event of Default by Seller after the Contract Start Date or by Buyer throughout the Contract Term);

(c) to withhold any payments due to the Defaulting Party under this Agreement;

(d) to suspend performance; and

(e) to exercise any other right or remedy available at Law or in equity, including specific performance or injunctive relief, except to the extent such remedies are expressly limited under this Agreement;

provided, that payment by the Defaulting Party of the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, shall constitute liquidated damages and the Non-Defaulting Party’s sole and exclusive remedy for the Terminated Transaction and the Event of Default related thereto. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller’s sole and aggregate liability under or arising out of a termination of this Agreement prior to the Contract Start Date shall be limited to the amount required to be posted as Pre-CSD Security pursuant to Section 8.7, less any amounts collected by Buyer prior to such Early Termination Date.

11.3 Termination Payment. The termination payment (“Termination Payment”) for a Terminated Transaction shall be the aggregate of all Settlement Amounts plus any all other amounts due to the Non-Defaulting Party netted into a single amount. If the Non-Defaulting Party’s aggregate Gains exceed its aggregate Losses and Costs, if any, resulting from the termination of this Agreement, the net Settlement Amount shall be zero. The Non-Defaulting Party shall calculate, in a commercially reasonable manner, a Settlement Amount for the Terminated Transaction as of the Early Termination Date. Third parties (which shall not include Affiliates of the Non-Defaulting Party) supplying information for purposes of the calculation of Gains or Losses may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors and other sources of market information. The Settlement Amount shall not include consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary, indirect or business interruption damages; provided, however, that any lost Capacity Attributes and Green Attributes shall be deemed direct damages covered by this Agreement. Without prejudice to the Non-Defaulting Party’s duty to mitigate, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not have to enter into replacement transactions to establish a Settlement Amount. Each Party agrees and acknowledges that (a) the actual damages that the Non-Defaulting Party would incur in connection with a Terminated Transaction would be difficult or impossible to predict with certainty, (b) the Damage Payment or Termination Payment described in Section 11.2 or this Section 11.3 (as applicable) is a reasonable and appropriate approximation of such damages, and (c) the Damage Payment or

![Termination Payment](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Termination+Payment)

Termination Payment described in Section 11.2 or this Section 11.3 (as applicable) is the exclusive remedy of the Non-Defaulting Party in connection with a Terminated Transaction but shall not otherwise act to limit any of the Non-Defaulting Party’s rights or remedies if the Non-Defaulting Party does not elect a Terminated Transaction as its remedy for an Event of Default by the Defaulting Party.

11.4 Notice of Payment of Termination Payment. As soon as practicable after a Terminated Transaction, Notice shall be given by the Non-Defaulting Party to the Defaulting Party of the amount of the Termination Payment and whether the Termination Payment is due to the Non-Defaulting Party. The Notice shall include a written statement explaining in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount and the sources for such calculation. The Termination Payment shall be made to the Non-Defaulting Party, as applicable, within ten (10) Business Days after such Notice is effective.

11.5 Disputes With Respect to Termination Payment. If the Defaulting Party disputes the Non-Defaulting Party’s calculation of the Termination Payment, in whole or in part, the Defaulting Party shall, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Non-Defaulting Party’s calculation of the Termination Payment, provide to the Non-Defaulting Party a detailed written explanation of the basis for such dispute. Disputes regarding the Termination Payment shall be determined in accordance with Article 15.

11.6 Rights And Remedies Are Cumulative. Except where liquidated damages are provided as the exclusive remedy, the rights and remedies of a Party under this article 11 shall be cumulative and in addition to the rights of the Parties otherwise provided in this Agreement.

11.7 Mitigation. Any Non-Defaulting Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its Costs, Losses and damages resulting from any Event of Default of the other Party under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 12  
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES

12.1 No Consequential Damages. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PART OF AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER OR ITS INDEMNIFIED PERSONS FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOSSES OR DAMAGES FOR LOST REVENUE OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE HERETO THE CONTRARY, IF THERE IS AN EARLY TERMINATION DATE PRIOR TO THE CONTRACT START DATE, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF SELLER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT REQUIRED TO BE POSTED AS PRE-CSD SECURITY PURSUANT TO SECTION 8.7, LESS ANY AMOUNTS COLLECTED BY BUYER PRIOR TO SUCH EARLY TERMINATION DATE.

FOR BREACH OF ANY PROVISION FOR WHICH AN EXPRESS AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS PROVIDED, SUCH EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, THE OBLIGOR’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED AS SET FORTH IN SUCH PROVISION, AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED.

IF NO REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, THE OBLIGOR’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES ONLY.

TO THE EXTENT ANY DAMAGES REQUIRED TO BE PAID HEREUNDER ARE LIQUIDATED, INCLUDING UNDER SECTIONS 3.8, 4.7, 4.8(e), 11.2 AND 11.3, AND AS PROVIDED IN EXHIBIT B AND EXHIBIT E, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DAMAGES ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE, THAT OTHERWISE OBTAINING AN ADEQUATE REMEDY IS INCONVENIENT, AND THAT THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CONSTITUTE A REASONABLE APPROXIMATION OF THE ANTICIPATED HARM OR LOSS. IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY PARTY, WHETHER SUCH NEGLIGENCE BE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT, OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO CONTEST SUCH PAYMENTS AS AN UNREASONABLE PENALTY.

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT MONEY DAMAGES AND THE EXPRESS REMEDIES PROVIDED FOR HEREIN ARE AN ADEQUATE REMEDY FOR THE BREACH BY THE OTHER OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND EACH PARTY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO ANY OBLIGATION OF THE OTHER PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

Notwithstanding Section 14.1, and in addition to its rights set forth in Section 14.2, Seller may at any time, without the prior written consent of Buyer, transfer or assign this Agreement (including by a Change of Control) (i) to an Affiliate of Seller, (ii) in connection with a tax equity financing (regardless of whether a Change of Control results from such tax equity financing), or (iii) as part of the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the membership interests, equity, or assets of an Affiliate of Seller. Seller may also, without the prior written consent of Buyer, transfer or assign this Agreement (including by a Change of Control) to a Permitted Transferee.

14.4 Buyer Assignment. At any time during the Contract Term, upon not less than thirty (30) days’ written notice to Seller, Buyer may request that Seller enter into negotiations to permit Buyer to enter into a limited assignment of a portion of Buyer’s rights and obligations under this Agreement to J. Aron and Company, LLC (“J. Aron”). Following any such Notice from Buyer, (a) Seller, Buyer and J. Aron shall negotiate in good faith the execution of a limited assignment agreement based on the form attached hereto as Exhibit J, and (b) if requested by Seller, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith an indemnity and/or a legal opinion, to be provided by Buyer for the benefit of Seller in connection with such limited assignment agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall remain responsible for all of its obligations under this Agreement, including those related to all Product that may be assigned to J. Aron under any limited assignment agreement, including (i) the obligation to pay for all Product and (ii) any and all damages, costs and expenses of Seller associated with such assignee’s failure to take or pay for any such Product as contemplated by this Agreement.

15.2 Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dispute arising under this Agreement, within ten (10) days following the receipt of a Notice from either Party identifying such dispute, the Parties shall meet, negotiate and attempt, in good faith, to resolve the dispute quickly, informally and inexpensively. If the Parties are unable to resolve a dispute arising hereunder within the earlier of either thirty (30) days of initiating such discussions, or within forty (40) days after Notice of the dispute, either Party may seek any and all remedies available to it at Law or in equity, subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 16
INDEMNIFICATION

16.1 Indemnification.

(a) Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, representatives and agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Party”) from and against all third-party claims, demands, losses, liabilities, penalties, and expenses and expert witness fees (collectively “Indemnifiable Event”), to the extent such Indemnifiable Event arises out of, results from, or is caused by any of the following: (a) the negligent act or omission, recklessness or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party, its Affiliates, its or their directors, officers, employees, agents, subcontractors, and anyone directly or indirectly employed by the Indemnifying Party or any of its subcontractors or anyone that they control; or (b) any violation of applicable Law by the Indemnifying Party, in each case in connection with this Agreement. Upon the Indemnified Party’s written request, the Indemnifying Party, at its own expense, must defend any suit or action that is subject to the Indemnifying Party’s indemnity obligations.

(b) Nothing in this Section 16.1 shall enlarge or relieve Seller or Buyer of any liability to the other for any breach of this Agreement. Neither Party shall be indemnified for its damages resulting to the extent of its own negligence, intentional acts, or willful misconduct. These indemnity provisions shall not be construed to relieve any insurer of its obligation to pay claims consistent with the provisions of a valid insurance policy.

16.2 Claims. Promptly after receipt by a Party of any claim or Notice of the indemnity provided for in this Article 16 may apply, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such fact. The Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof with counsel designated by such Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to, or inconsistent with, those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select and be represented by separate counsel, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, unless a liability insurer is willing to pay such costs. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of a claim meriting indemnification, the Indemnified Party may at the expense of the Indemnifying Party contest, settle, or pay such claim, provided that settlement or full payment of any such claim may be made only following consent of the Indemnifying Party or, absent such consent, written opinion of the Indemnified Party’s counsel that such claim is meritorious or warrants settlement.

<!-- Page 90 -->
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence if the settlement consists solely of a monetary payment by the Indemnifying Party, such settlement shall not require the consent of the Indemnifying Party. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 16, in the event that a Party is obligated to indemnify and hold the other Party and its successors and assigns harmless under this Article 16, the amount owing to the Indemnified Party will be the amount of the Indemnified Party’s damages net of any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party following a reasonable effort by the Indemnified Party to obtain such insurance proceeds.

# ARTICLE 17  
## INSURANCE

17.1 **Insurance.**

(a) **General Liability.** Seller shall maintain, or cause to be maintained at its sole expense, (i) commercial general liability insurance against claims for personal injury (including bodily injury and death) and property damage with a limit of liability of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence, and a general aggregate of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for combined bodily injury and property damage; and (ii) an umbrella insurance policy in a minimum limit of liability of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). The amounts of liability insurance described in this Article 17 may be satisfied by primary insurance or by any combination of primary and excess/umbrella insurance. Such insurance shall contain standard cross-liability and severability of interest provisions such that each person is protected in the same manner as though a separate policy has been issued to each but nothing therein shall increase the insurance company’s liability beyond the amount the insurance company would have been liable if only one Person or interest had been named as insured. The liability insurance policies referenced in this Article 17 shall (x) provide an endorsement waiving rights of subrogation against Buyer, (y) name Buyer as additional insured on all required liability insurance (except workers compensation), and (z) be primary to any insurance of Buyer that may apply to such occurrence, accident or claim and no “other insurance” provision shall be applicable to Buyer or any additional insureds, by virtue of having been named an additional insured under any policy of insurance.

(b) **Workers Compensation and Employer’s Liability Insurance.** Employers’ Liability insurance shall not be less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) providing statutory benefits as required by Law (if any exposure exists) for injury, sickness, disability or death of the employees.

(c) **Business Auto Liability Insurance.** Seller shall maintain at all times during the Contract Term business auto insurance for bodily injury and property damage with limits of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit. Such insurance shall cover liability arising out of Seller’s use of all owned (if any), non-owned and hired motor vehicles in the performance of the Agreement.

(d) **Property Insurance.** Seller shall maintain or cause to be maintained property insurance covering the Facility against physical loss or damage, including coverage for natural perils including but not limited to flood, earthquake, windstorm, severe convective storm, and wildfire, all with limits in accordance with industry standard recognizing that natural perils may.

be subject to a lower sublimit. Coverage will be on an "all-risk" basis including mechanical and electrical breakdown.

(e) Documentation. Before commencing work under this Agreement, Seller’s broker or agent shall provide certificates of insurance verifying that at least the minimum insurance coverages required above are in effect with additional insured, waiver of subrogation and any other policy provisions or endorsements include, as applicable. Acceptance of the evidence of coverage by Buyer shall not relieve or decrease the extent to which Seller may be held responsible for payment of damages resulting from Seller’s services or operations pursuant to this Agreement, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Buyer’s rights to insurance coverage hereunder. Failure to demand evidence of full compliance with the insurance requirements set forth in this Agreement or failure to identify any insurance deficiency shall not relieve Seller from, nor be construed or deemed a waiver of, its obligation to maintain the required insurance at all times during the performance of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 18  
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

18.1 Definition of Confidential Information. The following constitutes "Confidential Information," whether oral or written which is delivered by Seller to Buyer or by Buyer to Seller including: (a) pricing and other commercially-sensitive or proprietary information provided to or from Buyer in connection with the terms and conditions of, and proposals and negotiations related to, this Agreement, and (b) information that either Seller or Buyer stamps or otherwise identifies as "confidential" or "proprietary" before disclosing it to the other. Confidential Information does not include (i) information that was publicly available at the time of the disclosure, other than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Agreement; (ii) information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the recipient after the time of the delivery; (iii) information that was rightfully in the possession of the recipient (without confidential or proprietary restriction) at the time of delivery or that becomes available to the recipient from a source not subject to any restriction against disclosing such information to the recipient; and (iv) information that the recipient independently developed without a violation of this Agreement.

18.2 Duty to Maintain Confidentiality. Except as permitted in this Article 18, neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information to a third party, except upon the written consent of the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information will retain its character as Confidential Information but may be disclosed by the recipient (the "Receiving Party") if and to the extent such disclosure is required (a) to be made by any requirements of Law, (b) pursuant to an order of a court or (c) in order to enforce or implement this Agreement. If the Receiving Party becomes legally compelled (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas, summons, civil investigative demands, or similar processes or otherwise in connection with any litigation or to comply with any applicable Law, order, regulation, ruling, regulatory request, accounting disclosure rule or standard or any exchange, control area or independent system operator rule) to disclose any Confidential Information of the disclosing Party (the "Disclosing Party"), Receiving Party shall provide Disclosing Party with prompt notice so that Disclosing Party, at its sole expense, may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy.

18.3 Irreparable Injury; Remedies. Receiving Party acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are necessary and reasonable in order to protect Disclosing Party and the business of Disclosing Party, and expressly acknowledges that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate Disclosing Party for any breach or threatened breach by Receiving Party of any covenants and agreements set forth herein. Accordingly, Receiving Party acknowledges that any such breach or threatened breach may cause irreparable injury to Disclosing Party and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in Law, in equity or otherwise, Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages.

18.4 Permitted Disclosures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 18, Confidential Information may be disclosed by either Party to such Party’s counsel, accountants, auditors, advisors, other professional consultants, credit rating agencies, Affiliates or actual or prospective owners, investors, lenders, directors, underwriters, contractors, suppliers or others involved in the construction, operation and financing transactions and arrangements for a Party or its affiliates, or any of its or their agents, consultants or trustees, so long as the Person to whom Confidential Information is disclosed agrees in writing to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Article 18 to the same extent as if it were a Party, or is bound by substantially similar confidentiality requirements.

18.5 Press Releases. Neither Party shall issue (or cause its Affiliates to issue) a press release regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless both Parties have agreed upon the contents of any such public statement.

ARTICLE 19 MISCELLANEOUS

19.1 Entire Agreement; Integration; Exhibits. This Agreement, together with the Cover Sheet and Exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between Seller and Buyer with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to the subject matter hereof, which are of no further force or effect. The Exhibits attached hereto are integral parts hereof and are made a part of this Agreement by reference. The headings used herein are for convenience and reference purposes only.

19.4  No Agency, Partnership, Joint Venture or Lease. Seller and the agents and employees of Seller shall, in the performance of this Agreement, act in an independent capacity and not as officers or employees or agents of Buyer. Under this Agreement, Seller and Buyer intend to act as energy service provider and energy service recipient, respectively, and do not intend to be treated as, and shall not act as, partners in, co-venturers in or lessor/lessee with respect to the Facility or any business related to the Facility. This Agreement shall not impart any rights enforceable by any third party (other than a permitted successor or assignee bound to this Agreement).

19.5  Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable or held to be unenforceable, the Parties agree that all other provisions of this Agreement have force and effect and shall not be affected thereby. The Parties shall, however, use their best endeavors to agree on the replacement of the void, illegal or unenforceable provision(s) with legally acceptable clauses which correspond as closely as possible to the sense and purpose of the affected provision and this Agreement as a whole.

19.6  Mobile-Sierra. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party shall seek, nor shall they support, any third party seeking to prospectively or retroactively revise the rates, terms or conditions of service of this Agreement through application or complaint to FERC pursuant to provisions of Section 205, 206 or 306 of the Federal Power Act, or any other provisions of the Federal Power Act, absent prior written agreement of the Parties. Further, absent the prior written agreement in writing by both Parties, the standard of review for changes to the rates, terms or conditions of service of this Agreement proposed by a third party shall be the “public interest” standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956) and Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348 (1956). Changes proposed by a non-Party or FERC acting sua sponte shall be subject to the most stringent standard permissible under applicable Law.

19.7  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, including electronic signatures, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same instrument and each of which shall be deemed an original.

If Buyer and Seller are unable, within sixty (60) days after delivery of such request, to agree upon changes to this Agreement or to resolve issues relating to changes to this Agreement, then any Party may submit issues pertaining to changes to this Agreement to the dispute resolution process set forth in Article 15. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a change in cost shall not in and of itself be deemed to render this Agreement or any of the provisions hereof incapable of being performed or administered, or constitute, or form the basis of, a Force Majeure Event, and (ii) all of unaffected provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect during any period of such negotiation or dispute resolution.

## CONTRACT START DATE  

1. **Reserved.**  

2. **Contract Start.** “Contract Start” means the condition existing when (i) Seller has fulfilled all of the conditions in Section 2.3 of the Agreement and (ii) Seller has confirmed to Buyer in writing that Contract Start has been achieved.  

   The “Contract Start Date” shall be the date on which Contract Start is achieved.  
   
   a. Seller shall use good faith efforts to cause the Contract Start Date to occur by the Guaranteed Contract Start Date. Seller shall notify Buyer at least thirty (30) days before the anticipated Contract Start Date.  
   
   b. If Seller does not anticipate achieving Contract Start by the Guaranteed Contract Start Date, Seller may elect to extend the Guaranteed Contract Start Date by paying Delay Damages to Buyer for each day Seller desires to extend the Guaranteed Contract Start Date. If Seller elects to extend the Guaranteed Contract Start Date, on or before the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the then-current Guaranteed Contract Start Date, Seller shall provide Notice and payment to Buyer of the Delay Damages for the number of days of extension to the Guaranteed Contract Start Date (“Delay Damages Payment”); provided such Delay Damages Payment may, at Seller’s option, be in the form of cash or an irrevocable, standby letter of credit issued by a U.S. commercial bank, or a foreign bank with a U.S. branch, with such bank having a Credit Rating of at least A- with an outlook designation of “stable” from S&P or A3 with an outlook designation of “stable” from Moody’s, which letter of credit Buyer may draw on to receive such Delay Damages Payment. If Seller achieves Contract Start prior to the Guaranteed Contract Start Date as extended by the payment of the Delay Damages Payment, Buyer shall refund to Seller in cash the Delay Damages for each day Seller achieves Contract Start prior to the Guaranteed Contract Start Date, as extended, times the Delay Damages, not to exceed the total amount of the Delay Damages Payment paid by Seller pursuant to this Section 2(b). The Parties agree that Buyer’s receipt of Delay Damages shall not be construed as Buyer’s declaration that an Event of Default has occurred under any provision of Section 11.1.  

3. **Termination for Failure to Achieve Contract Start.** If the Facility has not achieved Contract Start by the Outside Contract Start Date, either Party may elect to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 2.6.  

4. **Extension of the Guaranteed Dates.** The Guaranteed Contract Start Date shall, subject to notice and documentation requirements set forth below, be automatically extended on a day-for-day basis (the “Permitted Extension”) for the following delays:  
   
   a. delays due to a Force Majeure Event;

b. delays caused by a Transmission Provider not caused by the Seller’s action or inaction; or

c. delay due to a Buyer breach or default under this Agreement.

The cumulative extensions granted under clauses 4(a) and 4(b) above shall not exceed ___ for any reason, including a Force Majeure Event. The extension granted under clause 4(c) above shall have no termination. Except to the extent Seller has paid Delay Damages, or due to a delay clause 4(c) above, no extension due to a Permitted Extension shall be given if (i) the delay was the result of Seller’s failure to take all commercially reasonable actions to meet its requirements and deadlines, (ii) Seller failed to provide requested documentation as provided below, or (iii) Seller failed to provide Notice to Buyer as required in the next sentence. Seller shall provide prompt Notice to Buyer of a delay, but in no case more than thirty (30) days after Seller becomes aware of such delay, except that in the case of a delay occurring within sixty (60) days of the Guaranteed Contract Start Date, or after such date, Seller must provide Notice within five (5) Business Days of Seller becoming aware of such delay. Upon request from Buyer, Seller shall provide documentation demonstrating to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction that the delays described above did not result from Seller’s actions or failure to take commercially reasonable actions.

# EXHIBIT E  
## ENERGY REPLACEMENT DAMAGES CALCULATION  

In accordance with Section 4.7, if Seller fails to achieve the Guaranteed Energy Production during any Performance Measurement Period, and Seller elects to not provide Replacement Product, a liquidated damages (“Energy Replacement Damages”) payment shall be due from Seller to Buyer, calculated as follows:  

\[
[(A - B) * (C - D)] - E
\]

where:  

- **A** = the Guaranteed Energy Production amount for the Performance Measurement Period, in MWh  
- **B** = the Adjusted Energy Production amount for the Performance Measurement Period, in MWh  
- **C** = Replacement price for the Performance Measurement Period, in $/MWh, which is the sum of (a) the simple average of the LMP in the Day-Ahead Market at the Delivery Point for all of the hours in the Performance Measurement Period, plus (b) the simple average REC Price for the applicable Performance Measurement Period.  
- **D** = the Contract Price, in $/MWh  
- **E** = the value of any Replacement Product provided retrospectively by Seller with respect to such Performance Measurement Period  

“Adjusted Energy Production” shall mean the sum of the following: (i) the greater of (a) if Seller provided Replacement Product or paid Energy Replacement Damages during the prior Performance Measurement Period, seventy percent (70%) of the Expected Energy for the first Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period or (b) the Delivered Energy plus Lost Output plus Deemed Delivered Energy in the first Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period, plus (ii) Delivered Energy plus Lost Output plus Deemed Delivered Energy in the second Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period.  

“Lost Output” means the sum of electric energy in MWh that would have been generated and delivered, but was not, on account of any Forced Facility Outage (not caused by Seller’s fault or negligence), Force Majeure Events, System Emergencies, Buyer’s failure to perform, and Curtailment Order. The additional MWh comprising Lost Output shall be calculated in the same manner as Deemed Delivered Energy.  

No payment shall be due if the calculation of (A - B) or (C - D) yields a negative number.

![EXHIBIT J FORM OF LIMITED ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1085.png?text=EXHIBIT+J+FORM+OF+LIMITED+ASSIGNMENT+AGREEMENT)

This Limited Assignment Agreement (this “Assignment Agreement” or “Agreement”) is entered into as of [____], by and among [____], a [____] (“PPA Seller”), Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a municipal utility district organized under the provisions of the Municipal Utility District Act (Division 6, Chapter 2, Articles 2 and 3, Sections 11581 through 11614 of the California Public Utilities Code, as amended) (“PPA Buyer”), and J. Aron & Company LLC, a New York limited liability company (“J. Aron”), and relates to that certain power purchase agreement between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller as further described in Appendix 1 (the “PPA”). Unless the context otherwise specifies or requires, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the PPA.

In consideration of the premises above and the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, PPA Seller, PPA Buyer and J. Aron (the “Parties” hereto; each is a “Party”) agree as follows:

1. Limited Assignment and Delegation.

(a) PPA Buyer hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to J. Aron all right, title and interest in and to the rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA to receive delivery of the products described on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Products”) during the Assignment Period (as defined in Appendix 1), as such rights may be limited or further described in the “Further Information” section on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Product Rights”). All Assigned Products shall be delivered pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the Assignment Period as provided in Appendix 1. All other rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly reserved for PPA Buyer. The Parties agree that the assignment, transfer and/or conveyance of all or any portion of the Assigned Products in accordance with this Agreement and the Parties’ performance of any obligation in accordance with this Agreement shall not constitute a failure to meet the requirements of the PPA, or a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty under the PPA (and in no event shall PPA Seller be responsible for any failure of any portion of the Assigned Products to satisfy the requirements of the PPA, to the extent such failure results from the assignment, transfer and/or conveyance of such Assigned Products in accordance with this Agreement).

(b) PPA Buyer hereby delegates to J. Aron the obligation to pay the APC Contract Price set forth in Appendix 1 for all Assigned Products that are actually delivered to J. Aron pursuant to the Assigned Product Rights during the Assignment Period (the “Delivered Product Payment Obligation” and together with the Assigned Product Rights, collectively the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”); provided that (i) all other obligations of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly retained by PPA Buyer and PPA Buyer shall be solely responsible for any amounts due to PPA Seller that are not directly related to Assigned Products; and (ii) the Parties acknowledge and agree that PPA Seller will only be obligated to deliver a single consolidated invoice during the Assignment Period (with a copy to J. Aron consistent with Section 1(d) hereof). To the extent J. Aron fails to pay for any Assigned Products by the due date for payment set forth in the PPA, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, PPA Buyer agrees that it will remain jointly and severally responsible as a primary obligor (and not as a surety) for such payment and that it will be an Event of Default pursuant to Section 11.1(a) if PPA Buyer does not make such payment within five (5) Business Days (as

**-2-**  
**OLD: 4888-6049-3514.14**  
**%FD-394166**  

(c) J. Aron hereby accepts and PPA Seller hereby consents and agrees to the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delegation described in clauses (a) and (b) above.

(d) All scheduling of Assigned Products and other communications related to the PPA shall take place between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller pursuant to the terms of the PPA; provided that (i) title to Assigned Product will pass from PPA Seller to J. Aron upon delivery by PPA Seller of Assigned Product in accordance with the PPA; (ii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any Notice of a Force Majeure Event or Event of Default or default, breach or other occurrence that, if not cured within the applicable grace period, could result in an Event of Default contemporaneously upon delivery thereof to PPA Seller and promptly after receipt thereof from PPA Seller; (iii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any forecasts of Energy generation provided by PPA Seller under the PPA; (iv) PPA Seller will provide copies to J. Aron of all invoices and supporting data provided to PPA Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1 of the PPA, provided that any payment adjustments or subsequent reconciliations occurring after the date that is 10 days prior to the payment due date for a monthly invoice, including pursuant to Section 8.4 of the PPA, will be resolved solely between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller and therefore PPA Seller will not be obligated to deliver copies of any communications relating thereto to J. Aron; and (v) PPA Buyer and PPA Seller, as applicable, will provide copies to J. Aron of any other information reasonably requested by J. Aron relating to Assigned Products.

(e) PPA Seller acknowledges that (i) J. Aron intends to immediately transfer title to any Assigned Products received from PPA Seller through one or more intermediaries such that all Assigned Products will be re-delivered to PPA Buyer; and (ii) in the event that PPA Buyer fails to pay the relevant intermediary entity for any such Assigned Products, the receivables owed by PPA Buyer for such Assigned Products (“PPA Buyer Receivables”) may be transferred to J. Aron. To the extent any such PPA Buyer Receivables are transferred to J. Aron, J. Aron may transfer such PPA Buyer Receivables to PPA Seller and apply the face amount thereof as a reduction to any Delivered Product Payment Obligation, and PPA Buyer waives all rights to dispute or claim any defence in respect of such PPA Buyer Receivables other than a defence that would have arisen under the PPA if this Agreement were not in effect. To effect such transfer, J. Aron shall deliver to PPA Seller a notice of intent to transfer PPA Buyer Receivables not later than the payment due date for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation and shall deliver to PPA Seller a bill of sale signed by J. Aron not later than five Business Days thereafter, provided that no such transfer or application shall reduce or limit PPA Buyer’s obligations under Section 1(b) above. Such transfer of PPA Buyer Receivables shall immediately be deemed an Event of Default under Section 11.1(a) of the PPA, without regard to any cure periods set forth therein, and PPA Seller shall be
<!-- Page 113 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/1085x768.png?text=Document+Image)

entitled to pursue collection on such PPA Buyer Receivables directly against PPA Buyer pursuant to the remedies set forth in the PPA for such Event of Default.

(f) On or before the commencement of the Assignment Period, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Guarantor”) will issue, in favor of PPA Seller, a guaranty of J. Aron’s payment obligations under this Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Appendix 3 attached hereto (“Guaranty”).

(g) The Assigned Prepay Quantity set forth in Appendix 2 relates to obligations by and between J. Aron and PPA Buyer and has no impact on PPA Seller’s rights and obligations under the PPA.

(h) In the event that the PPA or the Assigned Rights and obligations are either or both rejected or terminated in or as a result of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding affecting J.

(ii) In the event that J. Aron or an Affiliate becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, any Default Rights (as defined in 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as applicable and as amended (“Default Right”)) under this Agreement that may be exercised against J.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, J. Aron and PPA Seller expressly acknowledge and agree that:

(1) PPA Seller shall not be permitted to exercise any Default Right with respect to this Agreement or any Affiliate Credit Enhancement that is related, directly or indirectly, to an Affiliate of J. Aron becoming subject to receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution, or similar proceeding (an “Insolvency Proceeding”), except to the extent that the exercise of such Default Right would be permitted under the provisions of 12 C.F.R. 252.84, 12 C.F.R. 47.5 or 12 C.F.R. 382.4, as applicable and as amended; and

(2) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the transfer of any Affiliate Credit Enhancement, any interest or obligation in or under such Affiliate Credit Enhancement, or any property securing such Affiliate Credit Enhancement, to a transferee upon or following an Affiliate of J. Aron becoming subject to an Insolvency Proceeding, unless the transfer would result in PPA Seller being the beneficiary of such Affiliate Credit Enhancement in violation of any law applicable to PPA Seller.

(iv) If PPA Seller adheres to the ISDA U.S. Protocol, as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. as of July 31, 2018, after the date of this Agreement, the terms of the ISDA U.S. Protocol will supersede and replace the terms of this Section 6(b).

## Form of GSG Guaranty

, 2024

NAME  
ADDRESS  

Attention:

Ladies and Gentlemen:

For value received, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Guarantor”), a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, hereby unconditionally guarantees the prompt and complete payment when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations and liabilities, whether now in existence or hereafter arising, of J. Aron & Company LLC, a subsidiary of the Guarantor and a limited liability company duly organized under the laws of the State of New York (the “Company”), to COUNTERPARTY NAME (the “Counterparty”) arising out of or under the Limited Assignment Agreement among the Company, the Counterparty and [PPA Seller] dated as of [ ], 202[ ]. This Guaranty is one of payment and not of collection.

The Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and notice of any obligation or liability to which it may apply, and waives presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any such obligation or liability, suit or the taking of other action by Counterparty against, and any other notice to, the Company, the Guarantor or others.

Counterparty may at any time and from time to time without notice to or consent of the Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder: (1) agree with the Company to make any change in the terms of any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (2) take or fail to take any action of any kind in respect of any security for any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (3) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company or others, or (4) compromise or subordinate any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty including any security therefor. Any other suretyship defenses are hereby waived by the Guarantor.

This Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect until the opening of business on the fifth business day after Counterparty receives written notice of termination from the Guarantor. It is understood and agreed, however, that notwithstanding any such termination this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the obligations and liabilities set forth above which shall have been incurred prior to such termination.

<!-- Page 121 -->
The Guarantor further agrees that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the guaranteed obligations, or interest thereon is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Counterparty upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or reorganization of the Company. No failure on the part of the Counterparty to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Counterparty of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power. Notwithstanding anything in this Guaranty to the contrary, this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time, either before or after the termination hereof, payment of the obligations or liabilities guaranteed pursuant to this Guaranty, or any part thereof, is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Counterparty for any reason, including without limitation upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or the Guarantor, all as though such payment had not been made.

Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, Guarantor hereby agrees that no delay of Counterparty in the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights or a release of Guarantor from any obligations hereunder.

No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, or supplemented except in a writing signed by Guarantor and Counterparty.

The Guarantor hereby represents as follows:

(a) The Guarantor is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Guaranty have been and remain duly authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of the Guarantor's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, as amended to date, or any law, regulation, decree, order, judgment, resolution or any contractual restriction binding on the Guarantor or its assets that could affect, in a materially adverse manner, the ability of the Guarantor to perform any of its obligations hereunder.

(c) All consents, licenses, clearances, authorizations, and approvals of, and registration and declarations with, any governmental or regulatory authority necessary for the due execution and delivery of this Guaranty have been obtained and remain in full force and effect and all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental or regulatory authority is required in connection with the execution or delivery of this Guaranty.

(d) This Guaranty constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with all of its terms and conditions (subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors’ rights generally). The enforceability of the Guarantor’s obligations is also

Exhibit J-3  
SMRH:4888-6049-3514.24  
OLD: 4888-6049-3514.14

98FD-394166  
<!-- Page 122 -->
![Exhibit J-4](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Exhibit+J-4)

subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

The Guarantor may not assign its rights nor delegate its obligations under this Guaranty, in whole or in part, without prior written consent of the Counterparty, and any purported assignment or delegation absent such consent is void, except for (i) an assignment and delegation of all of the Guarantor’s rights and obligations hereunder in whatever form the Guarantor determines may be appropriate to a partnership, corporation, trust or other organization in whatever form that succeeds to all or substantially all of the Guarantor’s assets and business and that assumes such obligations by contract, operation of law or otherwise, and (ii) the Guarantor may transfer this Guaranty or any interest or obligation of the Guarantor in or under this Guaranty, or any property securing this Guaranty, to another entity as transferee as part of the resolution, restructuring or reorganization of the Guarantor upon or following the Guarantor becoming subject to a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding. Upon any such delegation and assumption or transfer of obligations, the Guarantor shall be relieved of and fully discharged from all obligations hereunder, whether such obligations arose before or after such delegation and assumption or transfer.

THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. GUARANTOR AGREES TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, OVER ANY DISPUTES ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY.

In the event the Guarantor becomes subject to a proceeding under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together, the "U.S. Special Resolution Regimes"), the transfer of this Guaranty, and any interest and obligation in or under, and any property securing, this Guaranty, from the Guarantor will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Guaranty, and any interest and obligation in or under this Guaranty, were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event the Company or the Guarantor, or any of their affiliates, becomes subject to a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, default rights against the Company or the Guarantor with respect to this Guaranty are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such default rights could be exercised under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Guaranty was governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.

Very truly yours,

THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

**PRINCIPLES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT**

SMUD is committed to developing carbon free renewable energy in a manner that supports the community, protects the environment, and respects human rights. This document provides guidance on the key objectives that SMUD expects to achieve associated with this commitment. Renewable energy projects engaged in a commercial relationship with SMUD such as a power purchase agreement will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, implement, and maintain throughout the associated term, a “Community Benefits Plan” that addresses how the project will achieve the key objectives identified herein.

**Key objectives:**

1. **Land Use:** Prioritize previously developed lands. Avoid or minimize impacts on sensitive environmental resources, including but not limited to cultural resources, tribal cultural resources, and biological resources such as endangered species habitat, vernal pools and other sensitive habitats, “Waters of the US”, “Waters of the State” and waters identified by California Department of Fish and Wildlife as “Streambed”. Provide additional mitigation measures if avoidance and minimization measures cannot fully eliminate impacts. Applicants are expected to discuss these topics with both SMUD and the lead agency as early as possible to identify potential associated issues in advance of the purchase power agreement being finalized.

2. **Land Use:** All projects should employ techniques for maintaining and/or restoring ecosystem function to the site in conjunction with renewable energy outcomes, including establishment of native vegetation, restricting use of herbicides and pesticides, use of grazing for vegetation management and seasonally appropriate maintenance practices. Where development is on or surrounded by agricultural lands the project should also employ agricultural practices on the property during operations including sheep grazing, dry crop farming and irrigated food production where feasible.

3. **Land Use:** Employ design and construction practices that minimize ground disturbance to the maximum extent possible. This is especially critical in areas where cultural, tribal and biological resources are of significant concern.

4. **Sustainable Life Cycle Management:** Include plans for sustainable life cycle management of construction materials and project components during construction and operation that provides for recycling and reuse of construction waste and waste during operation including but not limited to the solar panels.

5. **Community Benefits:**

   (a) **Inclusive Economic Development:** Leverage SMUD’s Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) team to connect with certified small business vendors/contractors in SMUD’s service territory to support the project. Submit requests to seed.mgr@smud.org.

<!-- Page 127 -->
6. Zero Carbon Workforce Development: SMUD seeks to galvanize and prepare the region for an inclusive, diverse, creative, and empowered future workforce. Leverage SMUD’s existing workforce development agreements, programs, and partnerships throughout the Project to support the development of a clean energy labor force. The Project Team will work with SMUD to engage various elements of the labor supply chain via pre-apprentice and apprenticeship programs, internships, informational sessions, and mentorship opportunities.

7. Sustainable Materials & Equipment: Sourcing materials and equipment from companies that have a human rights policy and statement of supply chain ethics commitment that expresses the corporation’s commitment to meet the responsibility to respect human rights and uphold ethical business practices in their operations and value chains.

# RESOLUTION NO. 24-11-06

WHEREAS, the California Energy Commission (CEC) mandates continuously escalating procurement of renewable energy by load-serving entities in California under the Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS); and

WHEREAS, by Resolution No. 21-04-04, adopted on April 15, 2021, this Board revised Strategic Direction SD-9, Resource Planning, to align with SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan goal of zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in SMUD’s energy supply by 2030, reflecting a more aggressive target than the state’s RPS requirements; and

WHEREAS, in 2023, SMUD received non-binding indicative offers from Pattern Energy, LLC (Pattern), for the Hatchet Ridge Wind Project and SunZia Wind Project (collectively, Projects) for renewable wind power; and

WHEREAS, SMUD performed an evaluation of the market and determined that the Projects provided superior value and key solutions compared to available alternatives; and

WHEREAS, the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for the Projects were offered by Pattern as a package deal and are therefore contingent upon one another; and

Buyer, as set forth above; provided, that the Parties acknowledge and agree that such terms are not intended to alter the other material terms of this Agreement.

3.7 Test Energy. If and to the extent the Facility generates Test Energy, Seller may, at its option, provide Notice to Buyer of the availability of Test Energy; such Notice shall be provided no less than ten (10) days prior to the first day that Seller proposes to sell Test Energy to Buyer. Upon receipt of such Notice, Buyer may, at its option, elect to purchase Test Energy at the Contract Price, and Buyer shall Notify Seller within five (5) days after receipt of such Notice if Buyer agrees to purchase Test Energy. If Buyer fails to respond within five (5) days after receipt of such Notice, Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed not to purchase Test Energy. If Buyer does not agree to purchase Test Energy as set forth in this Section 3.7, Seller may sell such Test Energy, and any related products or attributes, to third parties and keep any and all revenues (and bear any and all costs) associated with such sales. The conditions precedent in Section 2.3 are not applicable to the Parties’ obligations under this Section 3.7.

3.8 Capacity Attributes.

(a) From and after the Capacity Attributes Guarantee Date, Seller sells, grants, pledges, assigns and otherwise commits to Buyer all of the Capacity Attributes.

(b) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.8 and Section 3.12, throughout the Delivery Term, Seller shall perform all commercially reasonable actions necessary to ensure that the Facility is eligible to provide Capacity Attributes at the Delivery Point. From and after the Capacity Attributes Guarantee Date, subject to the provisions of this Section 3.8 and Section 3.12, Seller hereby covenants and agrees to transfer all Capacity Attributes to Buyer. Seller shall not commit or encumber any portion of Buyer's Share of the output of the Facility so as to prevent the entire Buyer’s Share from serving as Buyer's Supporting Resource (as defined in the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure Business Rules) and delivering the Guaranteed Capacity Attributes.

(c) Subject to Section 3.12, for the duration of the Delivery Term, Seller shall use good faith efforts, including as set forth in this Section 3.8(c), to comply with requirements in connection with Non-Resource Adequacy Capacity that (i) are instituted by the governing body of Buyer or the CAISO, and (ii) differ from CAISO or CPUC rules applicable to Resource Adequacy Benefits. Seller shall provide to Buyer an attestation, in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, stating that Buyer has procured the Capacity Attributes.

(d) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.8, at Buyer’s reasonable request, Seller shall execute such documents and instruments and take all steps and actions as may be reasonably required to effect recognition and transfer of the Capacity Attributes as belonging to Buyer; provided that no such request may impose any material additional third-party costs (other than those reimbursed by Buyer pursuant to Section 3.12) or obligations on Seller, or reduce Seller’s compensation hereunder.

(e) Buyer acknowledges that it may be required to take action and obtain certain rights at the Delivery Point in order to make use of the Capacity Attributes, including

-28-
84ET-387782
<!-- Page 167 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image) 

obtaining and maintaining Import Capability and/or other rights as may be required under applicable Law to import energy and capacity into the CAISO Balancing Authority Area and make use of the Capacity Attributes. If applicable, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to support Buyer’s efforts to (i) obtain such Import Capability, (ii) obtain any other rights that Buyer is required to obtain, or (iii) take any other actions that Buyer is required to take, in each case in order for Buyer to make use of the Capacity Attributes, and in each case as may be required under applicable law and as may change from time to time. Buyer’s failure to obtain or maintain Import Capability or any other rights or capacities, or take any other actions, necessary to support the importation of the Capacity Attributes or otherwise receive or utilize the Capacity Attributes, for reasons other than a Seller failure under this Agreement, shall not be a Seller breach hereunder; any Capacity Attributes, expressed in kW, not delivered to Buyer due to such failure of Buyer shall be defined as “Deemed Delivered Capacity Attributes”. In addition, if any action or inaction of the governing board of Buyer (x) prevents Seller from delivering any Capacity Attributes to Buyer using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with limited to Seller’s obligations hereunder with respect to Capacity Attributes as of the Effective Date, or (y) disqualifies the Facility from providing Capacity Attributes to Buyer, in whole or in part, all such undelivered or ineligible Capacity Attributes shall constitute Deemed Delivered Capacity Attributes.

(f) From and after the Capacity Attributes Guarantee Date, for any calendar month in which there is a Capacity Attribute Shortfall greater than zero (0) kW:

(i) Seller shall be liable for liquidated damages (“Capacity Damage Amount”) in the amount of

3.9 CEC Certification and Verification. Seller shall (i) file an application with the CEC for CEC Certification and Verification of the Facility as soon as possible after the Commercial Operation Date, and (ii) provide to the CEC all information necessary to verify the contents of such application and maintain CEC Certification and Verification for the Facility throughout the Delivery Term; provided, Seller shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of this sentence if Seller applies for CEC Certification and Verification within sixty (60) days after the Commercial Operation Date, and thereafter timely responds to any questions from the CEC.

Subject to the terms of this Section 3.9 and Section 3.12, Seller shall ensure that throughout the Delivery Term, the Product meet the criteria defined by the CEC Renewables Portfolio Standard Eligibility Guidebook for PCC-1.

- defined in Public Utilities Code Section 399.12 or Section 399.16; and (ii) the Project’s output delivered to Buyer qualifies under the requirements of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard. To the extent a change in law occurs after execution of this Agreement that causes this representation and warranty to be materially false or misleading, it shall not be an Event of Default if Seller has used commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such change in law. [STC 6]

(b) Applicable Law. This Agreement and the rights and duties of the Parties hereunder shall be governed by and construed, enforced and performed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, without regard to principles of conflicts of law.

under the Agreement with respect to obtaining, maintaining, conveying or effectuating Buyer’s use of (as applicable), the items listed below, then the Parties agree that the maximum amount of costs and expenses Seller shall be required to bear during any Contract Year shall be capped at  
(“Compliance Expenditure Cap”)

(a) CEC Certification and Verification;  
(b) Green Attributes;  
(c) WREGIS; and  
(d) Capacity Attributes.  

Any actions required for Seller to comply with its obligations set forth in the first paragraph above, the cost of which will be included in the Compliance Expenditure Cap, shall be referred to collectively as the “Compliance Actions.”  

If Seller reasonably anticipates the need to incur out-of-pocket expenses in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap in order to take any Compliance Action, Seller shall provide Notice to Buyer of such anticipated out-of-pocket expenses.  

Buyer will have ninety (90) days to evaluate such Notice (during which time period Seller is not obligated to take any Compliance Actions described in the Notice) and shall, within such time, either (1) agree to reimburse Seller for all or some portion of the costs that exceed the Compliance Expenditure Cap (such Buyer-agreed upon costs, the “Accepted Compliance Costs”), or (2) waive Seller’s obligation to take such Compliance Actions, or any part thereof, for which Buyer has not agreed to reimburse Seller. If Buyer does not respond to a Notice given by Seller under this Section 3.12 within ninety (90) days after Buyer’s receipt of same, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived its rights to require Seller to take the Compliance Actions that are the subject of the Notice, and Seller shall have no further obligations to take, and no liability for a failure to take, such Compliance Actions for the remainder of the Term; provided, however, that Seller shall have the right to reconsider Compliance Actions that have been rejected or waived pursuant to this paragraph at any time; provided further, upon Buyer’s written request in connection with such reconsideration, Seller shall provide Notice to Buyer with an updated estimate of the anticipated out-of-pocket expenses to take the reconsidered Compliance Action. Within ninety (90) days after Buyer’s receipt of Seller’s Notice, Buyer shall agree to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs or waive Seller’s obligation to take the reconsidered Compliance Actions, or any part thereof, for which Buyer does not agree to reimburse Seller; provided, if Buyer does not reply within such ninety (90) day period Buyer shall be deemed to have waived Seller’s obligation to take such Compliance Actions.  

If Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for the Accepted Compliance Costs, then Seller shall take such Compliance Actions covered by the Accepted Compliance Costs as agreed upon by Buyer and Buyer shall reimburse Seller for Seller’s actual costs to effectuate the Compliance Actions, not to exceed the Accepted Compliance Costs, within sixty (60) days from the time that Buyer receives an invoice and documentation of such costs from Seller.

Seller shall inform Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable of any developments that will affect either the duration of such outage or the availability of the Facility during or after the end of such outage. These real-time forecasts shall be communicated by email to Buyer unless Buyer requests an alternative method of communications reasonably acceptable to Seller.

4.5 Dispatch Down/Curtailment.

(a) General. Subject to Section 4.5(b), Seller agrees to reduce deliveries of the Energy produced by the Facility by the amount and for the period set forth in any Curtailment Order; provided that Seller is not required to reduce such amount to the extent it is inconsistent with the limitations of the Facility set out in the Operating Restrictions.

(b) Alternative Delivery Point/Third-Party Sales. In the event that, and for so long as, Seller is unable to deliver all or a portion of the Product to Buyer at the Delivery Point, but Seller is able to deliver Product to Buyer at one or more Alternative Delivery Points, such Alternative Delivery Points shall be considered the Delivery Point under this Agreement. If Buyer and Seller fail to agree upon an Alternative Delivery Point, (i) Seller may, in its sole discretion, sell and deliver some or all of the Product during any Curtailment Period to one or more third party buyers to the extent that Seller may do so in compliance with Law and Prudent Operating Practice, and (ii)

4.7 Guaranteed Energy Production.

(a) After the first Contract Year, Seller shall be required to deliver to Buyer no less than the Guaranteed Energy Production (as defined below) in each period of two (2) consecutive Contract Years during the Delivery Term (such that the first Performance Measurement Period comprises Contract Years 2 and 3, the second Performance Measurement Period comprises Contract years 3 and 4 and so on) (“Performance Measurement Period”). “Guaranteed Energy Production” means an amount of Product for each Performance Measurement Period, as measured in MWh, equal to in such Performance Measurement Period. The calculation will be performed once each Contract Year, beginning with the third anniversary of the Commercial Operation Date. Seller shall be excused from achieving the Guaranteed Energy Production during any Performance Measurement Period only to the extent of any Forced Facility Outage (provided Seller has followed Prudent Operating Practices), Force Majeure Events, System Emergencies, Buyer’s failure to perform, Curtailment Periods and Market Curtailment Periods. If Seller fails to achieve the Guaranteed Energy Production amount in any Performance Measurement Period, Seller shall (i) pay Buyer Energy Replacement Damages calculated in accordance with Exhibit E, or (ii) in lieu of paying some or all of the Energy Replacement Damages, at Seller’s discretion, provide Replacement Product retrospectively pursuant to and subject to the requirements of Section 4.7(b)(ii).

4.8  WREGIS. Seller shall, at its sole expense, take all actions and execute all documents or instruments necessary to ensure that all WREGIS Certificates associated with all Renewable Energy Credits corresponding to all Delivered Energy are issued and tracked for purposes of satisfying the requirements of the California Renewables Portfolio Standard and transferred in a timely manner to Buyer for Buyer’s sole benefit. Seller shall transfer such Renewable Energy Credits to Buyer. Seller shall comply with all Laws, including the WREGIS Operating Rules, regarding the certification and transfer of such WREGIS Certificates to Buyer and Buyer shall be given sole title to all such WREGIS Certificates. Seller shall satisfy its obligations pursuant to Section 3.10(d) and Section 4.2(b) by fulfilling its obligations under Sections 4.8(a) through (f) below. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 4.8, following the occurrence of the SPTO Date, Seller shall not be required to generate E-Tags associated with Delivered Energy and/or Replacement Energy unless required (i) pursuant to the CAISO Tariff, or (ii) by WREGIS, the CPUC, the CEC, or other applicable Law for matching E-Tags with Delivered Energy and/or Replacement Energy in order to validate RPS claims.

(a) Prior to the Commercial Operation Date, Seller shall register the Facility with WREGIS and establish an account with WREGIS (“Seller’s WREGIS Account”), which Seller shall maintain until the end of the Delivery Term. Seller shall transfer the WREGIS Certificates using Recurring Certificate Transfers from Seller’s WREGIS Account to the WREGIS account(s) of Buyer or the account(s) of a designate that Buyer identifies by Notice to Seller (“Buyer’s WREGIS Account”). Seller shall be responsible for all expenses associated with registering the Facility with WREGIS, establishing and maintaining Seller’s WREGIS Account, paying WREGIS fees, and transferring WREGIS Certificates from Seller’s WREGIS Account to Buyer’s WREGIS Account. Buyer shall be responsible for all expenses associated with establishing and maintaining Buyer’s WREGIS account.

(b) Seller shall cause Recurring Certificate Transfers to occur on a monthly basis in accordance with the certification procedure established by the WREGIS Operating Rules. Since WREGIS Certificates will only be created for whole MWh amounts of Energy generated, any fractional MWh amounts (i.e., kWh) will be carried forward until sufficient generation is accumulated for the creation of a WREGIS Certificate. WREGIS Certificates must be matched with E-Tags associated with the Dynamic Transfers (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred and the CEC does not require E-Tag matching in order to validate RPS claims, with the Delivered Energy and Replacement Energy). WREGIS Certificates without matching E-Tags associated with Dynamic Transfers (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred and the CEC does not require E-Tag matching in order to validate RPS claims, with the Delivered Energy and Replacement Energy) will be rejected.

(c) Seller shall, at its sole expense, ensure that the WREGIS Certificates for a given calendar month correspond with the Delivered Energy for such calendar month as evidenced by the amounts corresponding to the Facility’s metered data that match E-Tags associated with the Dynamic Transfers (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred and the CEC does not require E-Tag matching in order to validate RPS claims, with the Delivered Energy and Replacement Energy). Subject to delivery of Replacement Product, Seller shall ensure that no WREGIS Certificates are transferred to Buyer’s WREGIS Account unless they are the result of Delivered Energy reflected in the Facility’s metered data and matched with E-Tags associated

- **Section 4.8**  
  (d) Due to the approximately fourteen (14) day delay in the creation of WREGIS Certificates relative to the timing of invoice payment under Section 8.2, Buyer shall make an invoice payment for a given month in accordance with Section 8.2 notwithstanding that the WREGIS Certificates may not have been formally transferred to Buyer in accordance with the WREGIS Operating Rules and this Section 4.8. Notwithstanding this delay, Buyer shall have all right and title to all such WREGIS Certificates upon payment to Seller in accordance with Section 8.2.  
  (e) A “WREGIS Certificate Deficit” means any deficit or shortfall in WREGIS Certificates delivered to Buyer for a calendar month as compared to the Delivered Energy for the same calendar month (“Deficient Month”). If any WREGIS Certificate Deficit is caused, or the result of any action or inaction, by Seller, then the amount of Delivered Energy in the Deficient Month shall be reduced on a pro rata basis across all Settlement Periods in such Deficient Month by the amount of the WREGIS Certificate Deficit for purposes of calculating Buyer’s payment to Seller under Article 8 and the Guaranteed Energy Production for the applicable Performance Measurement Period; provided, however, that such adjustment shall not apply to the extent that after the ninety (90) days attributed to the delay in the creation of WREGIS Certificates for such Deficient Month, Seller either (x) resolves the WREGIS Certificate Deficit within an additional one hundred eighty (180) days (i) upon a schedule reasonably acceptable to Buyer and (ii) provided that such deliveries do not impose additional costs upon Buyer for which Seller refuses to provide reimbursement. If the amount of Delivered Energy in the Deficient Month is reduced in accordance with the prior sentence and neither (x) nor (y) of the prior sentence apply, Buyer shall pay Seller for any Delivered Energy that is delivered by Seller without corresponding WREGIS Certificates at a price equal to the lesser of (i) the Contract Price, or (ii) the LMP in the Day-Ahead Market at the Delivery Point, and for purposes of the Guaranteed Energy Production, Delivered Energy is reduced by the amount of the WREGIS Certificate Deficit for the applicable Performance Measurement Period. Without limiting Seller’s obligations under this Section 4.8, if a WREGIS Certificate Deficit is caused solely by an error or omission of WREGIS, Delivered Energy shall not be reduced pursuant to this Section 4.8(e) and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to cause WREGIS to correct its error or omission.  
  (f) If WREGIS changes the WREGIS Operating Rules after the Effective Date or applies the WREGIS Operating Rules in a manner inconsistent with this Section 4.8 after the Effective Date, the Parties promptly shall modify this Section 4.8 as reasonably required to cause and enable Seller to transfer to Buyer’s WREGIS Account a quantity of WREGIS Certificates for each given calendar month that corresponds to the Delivered Energy in the same calendar month.  
- **4.9 Modification of Installed Capacity.** At any time prior to January 31, 2025 (“Capacity Increase Deadline”), Seller shall have the option to elect to implement the South Turbine Uprate, and in connection therewith to (i) increase the maximum Installed Capacity of  
- **Page Number:** 41  
- **Document ID:** 84ET-387782  
<!-- Page 180 -->
the Facility listed on the Cover Sheet of this Agreement up to an amount equal to 3,800 MW, and (ii) increase the Expected Energy under this Agreement to reflect the increased generating capacity resulting from the South Turbine Uprate. Seller shall deliver Notice to Buyer of its election to implement the South Turbine Uprate no later than the Capacity Increase Deadline, which Notice shall include the increased maximum Installed Capacity of the Facility and increased Expected Energy under this Agreement. Upon receipt of such Notice by Buyer, this Agreement shall be deemed automatically amended as follows:

(a) The text “3,515 MW” in the section “Description of Facility” on the Cover Sheet of this Agreement shall be replaced with the maximum Installed Capacity amount set forth in Seller’s Notice to Buyer delivered pursuant to this Section 4.9; and

(b) The text “________ MWh” in the section “Expected Energy” on the Cover Sheet of this Agreement shall be replaced with the Expected Energy amount set forth in Seller’s Notice to Buyer delivered pursuant to this Section 4.9.

4.10 Standard of Care. Seller shall be responsible for designing, installing, operating, and maintaining the Facility (including all associated costs) in accordance with applicable Law, and shall comply with all applicable WECC, RC West, FERC and NERC requirements, and with Prudent Operating Practice, including applicable interconnection and telemetering requirements set forth in the Interconnection Agreement.

Seller shall ensure that: (a) operation and maintenance of the Facility is conducted in a safe manner and in accordance with the Interconnection Agreement and Prudent Operating Practice; and (b) any governmental authorizations and permits required for the construction and operation thereof are maintained. Consistent with (a) above, Seller shall ensure that any necessary and commercially reasonable repairs are made to the Facility.

Seller acknowledges receipt of SMUD’s Principles of Renewable Energy Development as expressed in Exhibit M, attached and incorporated herein. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to abide by the project-specific obligations identified in the “Community Benefits Plan” as described in Exhibit M, to the extent applicable to and feasible for the Facility as reasonably determined by Seller.

5.2 Cooperation. Each Party shall use reasonable efforts to implement the provisions of and administer this Agreement in accordance with the intent of the Parties to minimize all Taxes, so long as no Party is materially adversely affected by such efforts. The Parties shall cooperate to minimize Tax exposure; provided, however, that neither Party shall be obligated to incur any financial or operational burden to reduce Taxes for which the other Party is responsible hereunder without receiving due compensation therefor from the other Party. All Energy delivered by Seller to Buyer hereunder shall be a sale made at wholesale, with Buyer reselling such Energy.

ARTICLE 6
MAINTENANCE OF THE FACILITY

6.1 Maintenance of the Facility. Seller shall comply with Law and Prudent Operating Practice relating to the operation and maintenance of the Facility and the generation and sale of Product.

6.2 Maintenance of Health and Safety. Seller shall take reasonable safety precautions with respect to the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the Facility. If Seller becomes aware of any circumstances relating to the Facility that create an imminent risk of damage or injury to any Person or any Person’s property, Seller shall take prompt, reasonable action to prevent such damage or injury and shall give Buyer’s emergency contact identified on Exhibit K notice of such condition. Such action may include disconnecting and removing all or a portion of the Facility, or suspending the supply of Energy to Buyer.

6.3 Shared Facilities. The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain of the Interconnection Facilities, Seller’s rights and obligations under the Interconnection Agreement and Seller’s rights and obligations under transmission service agreements with a Transmission Provider, may be subject to certain shared facilities and/or co-tenancy agreements (“Shared Facilities Agreements”) to be entered into among two or more of Seller, the Participating Transmission Owner, Seller’s Affiliates, and/or third parties pursuant to which certain Interconnection Facilities, interconnection service and/or transmission service may be subject to joint ownership and/or shared maintenance and operation arrangements.

ARTICLE 7
METERING

7.1 Metering. Seller shall measure the amount of Delivered Energy produced by the Facility using an Approved Meter. The Approved Meter shall be installed at the switching station adjacent to the Sun2ia East Converter Station and maintained at Seller’s cost.

**ARTICLE 7**

**METERING**

7.1 Meter Maintenance. Seller shall be responsible for any costs, fines or penalties, including imbalance charges as a result of the inaccurate meter. The meter shall be kept under seal, such seals to be broken only when the meters are to be tested, adjusted, modified and/or relocated. In the event that Seller breaks a seal, Seller shall notify Buyer as soon as practicable. In addition, Seller hereby agrees to provide all Approved Meter data to Buyer in a form reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and consents to Buyer obtaining from CAISO or the PTO, as applicable (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred, in accordance with CAISO requirements only), the meter data applicable to the Facility and all inspection, testing and calibration data and reports. Seller, or Seller’s Scheduling Coordinator, shall cooperate with Buyer to allow both Parties to retrieve the meter reads from the CAISO Market Results Interface – Settlements (MRIS-S) (or its successor).

7.2 Meter Verification. Annually, if Seller has reason to believe there may be a meter malfunction, or upon Buyer’s reasonable request, Seller shall test the meter. The tests shall be conducted by independent third parties qualified to conduct such tests at Seller’s expense; provided, if the meter is tested at Buyer’s request and is determined to be accurate, the costs of such test shall be borne by Buyer. Buyer shall be notified seven (7) days in advance of such tests and have a right to be present during such tests. If a meter is inaccurate it shall be promptly repaired or replaced. If a meter is inaccurate by more than one percent (1%) and it is not known when the meter inaccuracy commenced (if such evidence exists such date will be used to adjust prior invoices), then the invoices covering the period of time since the last meter test shall be adjusted for the amount of the inaccuracy on the assumption that the inaccuracy persisted during the second half of such period.

**ARTICLE 8**

**INVOICING AND PAYMENT; CREDIT**

8.1 Invoicing. Seller shall deliver an invoice to Buyer no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the end of the prior monthly delivery period; provided that Seller’s failure to deliver an invoice to Buyer by such deadline shall not be a breach hereunder. Each invoice shall provide Buyer (a) records of metered data, including metering and CAISO transaction data sufficient to document and verify the amount of Delivered Energy for each Settlement Period during the preceding month, including the amount of Delivered Energy as set forth in the first CAISO settlement statement for the prior month that includes meter data from the Approved Meter, the applicable Contract Price, deviations between the Scheduled Energy and the Delivered Energy, the LMP in the Real-Time Market at the Delivery Point for each Settlement Period; (b) a reconciliation of hourly meter data, E-Tag data (to the extent required under the CAISO Tariff) and associated calculations, including the lesser of each hour, plus any additional data as may be reasonably required by Buyer for compliance with CPUC reporting obligations, including pursuant to the CPUC’s Energy Division Portfolio Content Category Classification Review Handbook (or successor publication); (c) a statement of the quantity of WREGIS Certificates transferred during the prior month that have been matched with E-Tags associated with the Dynamic Transfers (or, if the SPTO Date has occurred, with the Delivered Energy and Replacement Energy, to the extent required by WREGIS, the CPUC, the CEC, or other applicable Law); (d) access to any records, including invoices or settlement data from the CAISO, necessary to verify the accuracy of any amount; and (e) be in a reasonable format covering the services provided in the preceding month determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement.

<!-- Page 183 -->
8.2  Payment. Buyer shall make payment to Seller by wire transfer or ACH payment to the bank account provided on each monthly invoice. Buyer shall pay undisputed invoice amounts within thirty (30) days after receipt of the invoice. If such due date falls on a weekend, local business holiday observed by either Party, or a NERC holiday, such due date shall be the next Business Day. Payments made after the due date will be considered late and will bear interest on the unpaid balance. If the amount due is not paid on or before the due date or if any other payment that is due and owing from one party to another is not paid on or before its applicable due date, a late payment charge shall be applied to the unpaid balance and shall be added to the next billing statement. Such late payment charge shall be calculated based on an annual Interest Rate equal to the prime rate published on the date of the invoice in The Wall Street Journal (or, if The Wall Street Journal is not published on that day, the next succeeding date of publication), plus two percent (2%) (the “Interest Rate”). If the due date occurs on a day that is not a Business Day, the late payment charge shall begin to accrue on the next succeeding Business Day.

8.3  Books and Records. To facilitate payment and verification, each Party shall maintain all books and records necessary for billing and payments, including copies of all invoices under this Agreement, for a period of at least two (2) years or as otherwise required by Law. Upon fifteen (15) days’ Notice to Seller, Buyer shall be granted reasonable access to the accounting books and records pertaining to all invoices generated pursuant to this Agreement.

8.4  Payment Adjustments; Billing Errors. Payment adjustments shall be made if Seller discovers there have been good faith inaccuracies in invoicing that are not otherwise disputed under Section 8.5, there is determined to have been a meter inaccuracy sufficient to require a payment adjustment, or if CAISO recalculates amounts due or owing in respect of prior periods. If the required adjustment is in favor of Buyer, Buyer’s monthly payment shall be credited in an amount equal to the adjustment. If the required adjustment is in favor of Seller, Seller shall add the adjustment amount to Buyer’s next monthly invoice. Other than recalculations by CAISO, adjustments in favor of either Buyer or Seller shall bear interest, until settled in full, in accordance with Section 8.2, accruing from the date on which the non-erring Party received Notice thereof.

8.5  Billing Disputes. A Party may, in good faith, dispute the correctness of any invoice or any adjustment to an invoice rendered under this Agreement or adjust any invoice for any arithmetic or computational error within twelve (12) months of the date the invoice, or adjustment to an invoice, was rendered. In the event an invoice or portion thereof, or any other claim or adjustment arising hereunder, is disputed, payment of the undisputed portion of the invoice shall be required to be made when due. Any invoice dispute or invoice adjustment shall be in writing and shall state the basis for the dispute or adjustment. Payment of the disputed amount shall not be required until the dispute is resolved. Upon resolution of the dispute, any required payment shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of such resolution along with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the original due date to but excluding the date paid. Inadvertent overpayments shall be returned upon request or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment from subsequent payments, with interest accrued at the Interest Rate from and including the date of such overpayment but excluding the date repaid or deducted by the Party receiving such overpayment. Any dispute with respect to an invoice is waived if the other Party is not notified in accordance with this Section 8.5 within twelve (12) months after the -45- 84ET-387782

invoice is rendered or subsequently adjusted, except to the extent any misinformation was from a third party not affiliated with any Party and such third party corrects its information after the twelve-month period. If an invoice is not rendered within twelve (12) months after the close of the month during which performance occurred, the right to payment for such performance is waived.

8.6 Netting of Payments. The Parties hereby agree that they shall discharge mutual debts and payment obligations due and owing to each other on the same date through netting, in which case all undisputed amounts owed by each Party to the other Party for the purchase and sale of Product during the monthly billing period under this Agreement or otherwise arising out of this Agreement, including any related damages calculated pursuant to Exhibits B and E, interest, and payments or credits, including pursuant to Section 4.3(c), shall be netted so that only the excess amount remaining due shall be paid by the Party who owes the remaining amount.

8.7 Seller's Development Security. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall deliver Development Security to Buyer within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date. Seller shall maintain the Development Security in full force and effect. Upon the earlier of (A) Seller’s delivery of the Performance Security, or (B) sixty (60) days after termination of this Agreement, Buyer shall return the Development Security to Seller, less the amounts drawn in accordance with this Agreement. If and to the extent that any portion of the Development Security is a Letter of Credit and the issuer of such Letter of Credit (i) fails to maintain a Credit Rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s, (ii) indicates its intent not to renew such Letter of Credit and such Letter of Credits prior to the Commercial Operation Date, (iii) becomes Bankrupt, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to post substitute collateral that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Development Security. Seller shall have no obligation to replenish the Development Security following any draws thereon by Buyer. Seller’s maximum liability for an Event of Default or failure to perform its obligations hereunder prior to the Commercial Operation Date shall be capped at the amount of the Development Security, less any amounts collected by Buyer prior to such Event of Default or failure to perform.

8.8 Seller's Performance Security. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, Seller shall deliver Performance Security to Buyer on or before the Commercial Operation Date. Seller shall maintain the Performance Security in full force and effect until the following occurred: (A) the Delivery Term has expired or terminated early; and (B) all payment obligations of the Seller arising under this Agreement, including compensation for penalties, Termination Payment, indemnification payments or other damages are paid in full (whether directly or indirectly such as through set-off or netting). Following the occurrence of both events, Buyer shall promptly return to Seller the unused portion of the Performance Security. If and to the extent that any portion of the Performance Security is a Letter of Credit and the issuer of such Letter of Credit (i) fails to maintain a Credit Rating of at least “A-” by S&P or “A3” by Moody’s, (ii) fails to honor Buyer’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit, or (iii) becomes Bankrupt, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days to post substitute collateral that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Performance Security.

In all cases the statements shall be for the most recent accounting period and prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”); provided, however, that should any such statements not be available on a timely basis due to a delay in preparation or certifications, such unavailability shall not be an Event of Default so long as Buyer diligently pursues the preparation, certification, and delivery of the statements.

8.10 Buyer’s First Priority Security Interest in Cash or Cash Equivalent Collateral. To secure its obligations under this Agreement, and until released as provided herein, Seller hereby grants to Buyer a present and continuing first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), and assignment of the Development Security or Performance Security, any other cash collateral and cash equivalent collateral posted by Seller pursuant to Sections 8.7 and 8.8, and any and all interest thereon or proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof, whether now or hereafter held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of Buyer, and Seller agrees to take all action as Buyer reasonably requires in order to perfect Buyer’s first-priority security interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), such collateral and any and all proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof.

Upon or any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default caused by Seller, an Early Termination Date resulting from an Event of Default caused by Seller, or an occasion provided for in this Agreement where Buyer is authorized to retain all or a portion of the Development Security or Performance Security, Buyer may do any one or more of the following (in each case subject to the final sentence of this Section 8.10 and the provisions of Article 12):

(a) Exercise any of its rights and remedies with respect to the Development Security or Performance Security, as applicable, including any such rights and remedies under Law then in effect;

(b) Draw on any outstanding Letter of Credit issued for its benefit and retain any cash held by Buyer as Development Security or Performance Security, as applicable; and

(c) Liquidate all Development Security or Performance Security, as applicable then held by or for the benefit of Buyer from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of Seller, including any equity or right of purchase or redemption by Seller.

Buyer shall apply the proceeds of the collateral realized upon the exercise of any such rights or remedies to reduce Seller’s obligations under this Agreement (Seller remains liable for any amounts owing to Buyer after such application), subject to Buyer’s obligation to return any surplus proceeds remaining after these obligations are satisfied in full.

## FORCE MAJEURE

**10.1 Definition.**

(a) **“Force Majeure Event”** means any act or event that delays or prevents a Party from timely performing all or a portion of its obligations under this Agreement or from complying with all or a portion of the conditions under this Agreement if such act or event, which event or circumstance, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, cannot be avoided by and is beyond the reasonable control (whether direct or indirect) of and without the fault or negligence of the Party relying thereon as justification for such delay, nonperformance, or noncompliance.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, so long as the following events, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, cannot be avoided by, and are beyond the reasonable control (whether direct or indirect) of and without the fault or negligence of the Party relying thereon as justification for such delay, nonperformance or noncompliance, a Force Majeure Event may include an act of God or the elements, such as flooding, lightning, hurricanes, tornadoes, or ice storms; explosion; fire; volcanic eruption; flood; epidemic, or pandemic, including COVID-19 (but only to the extent that new governmental rules or mandates related to COVID-19 are implemented that were not in place as of the Effective Date); landslide; mudslide; sabotage; terrorism; earthquake; or other cataclysmic events; an act of public enemy; acts or failure to act by a Governmental Authority; war; blockade; civil insurrection; riot; civil

84ET-387782

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term “Force Majeure Event” does not include (i) economic conditions that render a Party’s performance of this Agreement at the Contract Price unprofitable or otherwise uneconomic (including Buyer’s ability to buy Energy at a lower price, or Seller’s ability to sell Energy generated by the Facility at a higher price, than the Contract Price); (ii) Seller’s inability to obtain permits or approvals of any type for the construction, operation, or maintenance of the Facility, except to the extent such inability is caused by a Force Majeure Event; (iii) the inability of a Party to make payments when due under this Agreement; (iv) a Curtailment Order, except to the extent that a Curtailment Order is caused by an event that otherwise qualifies as a Force Majeure Event; (v) Seller’s inability to obtain sufficient labor, equipment, materials, or other resources to build or operate the Facility except to the extent such inability is caused by a Force Majeure Event; (vi) a strike, work stoppage or labor dispute limited only to any one or more of Seller, Seller’s Affiliates, Seller’s contractors, their subcontractors thereof or any other third party employed by Seller to work on the Facility; (vii) any equipment failure except if such equipment failure is caused by a Force Majeure Event; or (viii) except as the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date may be extended as a result of a Development Cure Period, Seller’s inability to achieve Commercial Operation following the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date.

10.2 No Liability If a Force Majeure Event Occurs. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall be liable to the other Party in the event it is prevented from performing its obligations hereunder in whole or in part due to a Force Majeure Event. The Party rendered unable to fulfill any obligation by reason of a Force Majeure Event shall take reasonable actions necessary to remove such inability with due speed and diligence. Nothing herein shall be construed as permitting that Party to continue to fail to perform after said cause has been removed. The obligation to use due speed and diligence shall not be interpreted to require resolution of labor disputes by acceding to demands of the opposition when such course is inadvisable in the discretion of the Party having such difficulty. Neither Party shall be considered in breach or default of this Agreement if and to the extent that any failure or delay in the Party’s performance of one or more of its obligations hereunder is caused by a Force Majeure Event. The occurrence and continuation of a Force Majeure Event shall not suspend or excuse the obligation of a Party to make any payments due hereunder. Any delays caused by a Force Majeure Event will not serve to increase the Contract Term nor Contract Price of this Agreement.

10.3 Notice. In the event of any delay or nonperformance resulting from a Force Majeure Event, the Party suffering the Force Majeure Event shall (a) as soon as practicable, notify the other Party in writing of the nature, cause, estimated date of commencement thereof, the anticipated extent of any delay or interruption in performance, and, to the extent reasonably practicable, a mitigation plan for limiting or overcoming the impacts of the Force Majeure Event and (b) notify the other Party in writing of the cessation or termination of such Force Majeure Event, all as known or estimated in good faith by the affected Party; provided, however, that a Party’s failure to give timely Notice as provided in this Section 10.3 shall not affect such Party’s ability to assert that a Force Majeure Event has occurred unless the delay in giving Notice materially prejudices the other Party.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
10.4 **Termination Following Force Majeure Event.** If a Force Majeure Event has occurred after the Commercial Operation Date that has caused either Party to be unable to perform its material obligations hereunder, and has continued for a consecutive twelve (12) month period, then the non-claiming Party may terminate this Agreement upon Notice to the other Party experiencing the Force Majeure Event; provided that if Seller is the Party claiming such Force Majeure Event and such Force Majeure Event cannot reasonably be cured within such twelve (12) month period, then Seller may provide a plan to Buyer, which must be acceptable to Buyer in its reasonable discretion, to cure such Force Majeure Event within an additional consecutive six (6) month period and Buyer may not terminate this Agreement due to such Force Majeure Event unless Seller has not resumed performance of its material obligations hereunder upon the expiration of such additional consecutive six (6) month period. Upon any such termination, the non-claiming Party shall have no liability to the Party claiming Force Majeure Event, save and except for those obligations specified in Section 2.1(b).

**ARTICLE 11**  
**DEFAULTS; REMEDIES; TERMINATION**  
11.1 **Events of Default.** An “Event of Default” shall mean,  
(a) with respect to a Party (the “Defaulting Party”) that is subject to the Event of Default the occurrence of any of the following:  
(i) the failure by such Party to make, when due, any payment required pursuant to this Agreement and such failure is not remedied within five (5) Business Days after Notice thereof;

(iii) the failure by such Party to perform any material covenant or obligation set forth in this Agreement (except to the extent constituting a separate Event of Default) and such failure is not remedied within thirty (30) days after Notice thereof; provided, that this thirty (30) day period shall be extended by an additional sixty (60) days if (a) the breach cannot reasonably be cured within the thirty (30) day period despite diligent efforts, (b) the default is capable of being cured within the additional sixty (60) day period, and (c) the Defaulting Party commences the cure within the original thirty (30) day period and is at all times thereafter diligently and continuously proceeding to cure the breach;  
(iv) failure by such Party to satisfy the collateral requirements pursuant to Sections 8.7 or 8.8 as applicable;

11.2 Remedies; Declaration of Early Termination Date. If an Event of Default with respect to a Defaulting Party shall have occurred and be continuing, the other Party (“Non-Defaulting Party”) shall have the following rights:

(a) to send Notice, designating a day, no earlier than the day such Notice is deemed to be received and no later than twenty (20) days after such Notice is deemed to be received, as an early termination date of this Agreement (“Early Termination Date”) that terminates this Agreement (the “Terminated Transaction”) and ends the Contract Term effective as of the Early Termination Date;

(b) to accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties, and to collect as liquidated damages (i) the Damage Payment (in the case of an Event of Default by Seller occurring before the Commercial Operation Date) or (ii) the Termination Payment calculated in accordance with Section 11.3 below (in the case of any other Event of Default by Seller after the Commercial Operation Date or by Buyer throughout the Contract Term);

(c) to withhold any payments due to the Defaulting Party under this Agreement;

(d) to suspend performance; and

(e) to exercise any other right or remedy available at Law or in equity, including specific performance or injunctive relief, except to the extent such remedies are expressly limited under this Agreement;

provided, that payment by the Defaulting Party of the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, shall constitute liquidated damages and the Non-Defaulting Party’s sole and exclusive remedy for the Terminated Transaction and the Event of Default related thereto. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller’s sole and aggregate liability under or arising out of a termination of this Agreement prior to the Commercial Operation Date shall be limited to the amount required to be posted as Development Security pursuant to Section 8.7, less any amounts collected by Buyer prior to such Early Termination Date.

11.3 Termination Payment. The termination payment (“Termination Payment”) for a Terminated Transaction shall be the aggregate of all Settlement Amounts plus any or all other amounts due to the Non-Defaulting Party netted into a single amount. If the Non-Defaulting Party’s aggregate Gains exceed its aggregate Losses and Costs, if any, resulting from the termination of this Agreement, the net Settlement Amount shall be zero. The Non-Defaulting Party shall calculate, in a commercially reasonable manner, a Settlement Amount for the Terminated Transaction as of the Early Termination Date. Third parties (which shall not include Affiliates of the Non-Defaulting Party) supplying information for purposes of the calculation of Gains or Losses may include, without limitation, dealers in the relevant markets, end-users of the relevant product, information vendors and other sources of market information. The Settlement Amount shall not include consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary, indirect or business interruption damages; provided, however, that any lost Capacity Attributes and Green Attributes shall be deemed direct damages covered by this Agreement. Without prejudice to the Non-Defaulting Party’s duty to mitigate, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not have to enter into

**ARTICLE 11**  
**TERMINATION PAYMENTS**  

11.1 **Termination Payment**. If a Terminated Transaction occurs, the Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled to receive from the Defaulting Party a payment (the “Termination Payment”) in an amount equal to the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, as determined in accordance with this Agreement. The Termination Payment shall be calculated based on the value of the Terminated Transaction and the cost of replacement transactions to establish a Settlement Amount. Each Party agrees and acknowledges that (a) the actual damages that the Non-Defaulting Party would incur in connection with a Terminated Transaction would be difficult or impossible to predict with certainty, (b) the Damage Payment or Termination Payment described in Section 11.2 or this Section 11.3 (as applicable) is a reasonable and appropriate approximation of such damages, and (c) the Damage Payment or Termination Payment described in Section 11.2 or this Section 11.3 (as applicable) is the exclusive remedy of the Non-Defaulting Party in connection with a Terminated Transaction but shall not otherwise act to limit any of the Non-Defaulting Party’s rights or remedies if the Non-Defaulting Party does not elect a Terminated Transaction as its remedy for an Event of Default by the Defaulting Party.

11.4 **Notice of Payment of Termination Payment**. As soon as practicable after a Terminated Transaction, Notice shall be given by the Non-Defaulting Party to the Defaulting Party of the amount of the Termination Payment and whether the Termination Payment is due to the Non-Defaulting Party. The Notice shall include a written statement explaining in reasonable detail the calculation of such amount and the sources for such calculation. The Termination Payment shall be made to the Non-Defaulting Party, as applicable, within ten (10) Business Days after such Notice is effective.

11.5 **Disputes With Respect to Termination Payment**. If the Defaulting Party disputes the Non-Defaulting Party’s calculation of the Termination Payment, in whole or in part, the Defaulting Party shall, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of the Non-Defaulting Party’s Notice, provide the Non-Defaulting Party a detailed written explanation of the basis for such dispute. Disputes regarding the Termination Payment shall be determined in accordance with Article 15.

11.6 **Rights And Remedies Are Cumulative**. Except where liquidated damages are provided as the exclusive remedy, the rights and remedies of a Party pursuant to this Article 11 shall be cumulative and in addition to the rights of the Parties otherwise provided in this Agreement.

11.7 **Mitigation**. Any Non-Defaulting Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate its Costs, Losses and damages resulting from any Event of Default of the other Party under this Agreement.

**ARTICLE 12**  
**LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES**  

12.1 **No Consequential Damages**. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PART OF AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER OR ITS INDEMNIFIED PERSONS FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOSSES OR DAMAGES FOR LOST REVENUE OR LOST PROFITS, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR NOT, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE.

12.2 Waiver and Exclusion of Other Damages. The parties confirm that the express remedies and measures of damages provided in this agreement satisfy the essential purposes hereof. All limitations of liability contained in this agreement, including, without limitation, those pertaining to the parties’ limitation of liability and the parties’ waiver of consequential damages, shall apply even if the remedies for breach of warranty provided in this agreement are deemed to “fail of their essential purpose” or are otherwise held to be invalid or unenforceable.

Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, if there is an early termination date prior to the commercial operation date, the total liability of seller under this agreement shall be limited to the amount required to be posted as development security pursuant to section 8.7, less any amounts collected by buyer prior to such early termination date.

For breach of any provision for which an express and exclusive remedy or measure of damages is provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy, the obligor’s liability shall be limited as set forth in such provision, and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are waived.

If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly provided herein, the obligor’s liability shall be limited to direct damages only. The value of any tax benefits, determined on an after-tax basis, lost due to buyer’s default (which seller has not been able to mitigate after use of reasonable efforts) and amounts due in connection with the recapture of any renewable energy incentives, if any, shall be deemed to be direct damages.

To the extent any damages required to be paid hereunder are liquidated, including under sections 3.8, 4.7, 4.8(e), 11.2 and 11.3, and as provided in exhibit B and exhibit E, the parties acknowledge that the damages are difficult or impossible to determine, that otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy is inconvenient, and that the liquidated damages constitute a reasonable approximation of the anticipated harm or loss. It is the intent of the parties that the limitations herein imposed on remedies and the measure of damages be without regard to the cause or causes related thereto, including the negligence of any party, whether such negligence be sole, joint or concurrent, or active or passive. The parties hereby waive any right to contest such payments as an unreasonable penalty.

The parties acknowledge and agree that money damages and the express remedies provided for herein are an adequate remedy for the breach by the other of the terms of this agreement, and each

14.1 Assignment. Neither Party may assign this Agreement without the written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any direct or indirect Change of Control of a Party (whether voluntary or by operation of Law) will be deemed an assignment and will require the prior written consent of the other Party, except as provided in Section 14.3.

shall be brought in the federal courts of the United States or, if such federal courts refuse jurisdiction notwithstanding the Parties' agreement, then in the courts of the State of California, in either case sitting in the County of San Francisco, California.

ARTICLE 16
INDEMNIFICATION

16.1 Indemnification.

(a) Each Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys, representatives and agents (collectively, the “Indemnified Party”) from and against all third-party claims, demands, losses, liabilities, penalties, and expenses and expert witness fees (collectively “Indemnifiable Event”), to the extent such Indemnifiable Event arises out of, results from, or is caused by any of the following: (a) the negligent act or omission, recklessness or willful misconduct of the Indemnifying Party, its Affiliates, its or their directors, officers, employees, agents, subcontractors, and anyone directly or indirectly employed by the Indemnifying Party or any of its subcontractors or anyone that they control; or (b) any violation of applicable Law by the Indemnifying Party, in each case in connection with this Agreement. Upon the Indemnified Party’s written request, the Indemnifying Party, at its own expense, must defend any suit or action that is subject to the Indemnifying Party’s indemnity obligations.

(b) Nothing in this Section 16.1 shall enlarge or relieve Seller or Buyer of any liability to the other for any breach of this Agreement. Neither Party shall be indemnified for its own damages resulting to the extent of its own negligence, intentional acts, or willful misconduct. These indemnity provisions shall not be construed to relieve any insurer of its obligation to pay claims consistent with the provisions of a valid insurance policy.

16.2 Claims. Promptly after receipt by a Party of any claim or Notice of the commencement of any action, administrative, or legal proceeding, or investigation as to which the indemnity provided for in this Article 16 may apply, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such fact. The Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof with counsel designated by such Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, provided, however, that if the defendants in any such action include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to, or inconsistent with, those available to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select and be represented by separate counsel, at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, unless a liability insurer is willing to pay such costs. If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume

-58-
84ET-387782
<!-- Page 197 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the defense of a claim meriting indemnification, the Indemnified Party may at the expense of the Indemnifying Party contest, settle, or pay such claim, provided that settlement or full payment of any such claim may be made only following consent of the Indemnifying Party or, absent such consent, written opinion of the Indemnified Party’s counsel that such claim is meritorious or warrants settlement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence if the settlement consists solely of a monetary payment by the Indemnifying Party, such settlement shall not require the consent of the Indemnifying Party. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 16, in the event that a Party is obligated to indemnify and hold the other Party and its successors and assigns harmless under this Article 16, the amount owing to the Indemnified Party will be the amount of the Indemnified Party’s damages net of any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party following a reasonable effort by the Indemnified Party to obtain such insurance proceeds.

ARTICLE 17  
INSURANCE

17.1 Insurance.

(a) General Liability. Seller shall maintain, or cause to be maintained at its sole expense, (i) commercial general liability insurance against claims for personal injury (including bodily injury and death) and property damage with a limit of liability of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence, and a general aggregate of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) for combined bodily injury and property damage; and (ii) an umbrella insurance policy in a minimum limit of liability of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). The amounts of liability insurance described in this Article 17 may be satisfied by primary insurance or by any combination of primary and excess/umbrella insurance. Such insurance shall contain standard cross-liability and severability of interest provisions such that each person is protected in the same manner as though a separate policy has been issued to each but nothing therein shall operate to increase the insurance company’s liability beyond the amount the insurance company would have been liable if only one Person or interest had been named as insured. The liability insurance policies referenced in this Article 17 shall (x) provide an endorsement waiving rights of subrogation against Buyer, (y) name Buyer as additional insured on all required liability insurance (except workers compensation), and (z) be primary to any insurance of Buyer that may apply to such occurrence, accident or claim and no “other insurance” provision shall be applicable to Buyer or any additional insureds, by virtue of having been named an additional insured under any policy of insurance.

(b) Workers Compensation and Employer’s Liability Insurance. Employers’ Liability insurance shall not be less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) providing statutory benefits as required by Law (if any exposure exists) for injury, sickness, disability or death of the employees.

(c) Business Auto Liability Insurance. Seller shall maintain at all times during the Contract Term business auto insurance for bodily injury and property damage with limits of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) combined single limit. Such insurance shall cover liability arising out of Seller’s use of all owned (if any), non-owned and hired motor vehicles in the performance of the Agreement.

-59-  
84ET-387782
<!-- Page 198 -->
(d) Property Insurance. Seller shall maintain or cause to be maintained property insurance covering the Facility against physical loss or damage, including coverage for natural perils including but not limited to flood, earthquake, windstorm, severe convective storm, and wildfire, all with limits in accordance with industry standard recognizing that natural perils may be subject to a lower sublimit. Coverage will be on an "all-risk" basis including mechanical and electrical breakdown.

(e) Documentation. Before commencing work under this Agreement, Seller’s broker or agent shall provide certificates of insurance verifying that at least the minimum insurance coverages required above are in effect with additional insured, waiver of subrogation and any other policy provisions or endorsements included, as applicable. Acceptance of the evidence of coverage by Buyer shall not relieve or decrease the extent to which Seller may be held responsible for payment of damages resulting from Seller’s services or operations pursuant to this Agreement, nor shall it be deemed a waiver of Buyer’s rights to insurance coverage hereunder. Failure to demand evidence of full compliance with the insurance requirements set forth in this Agreement or failure to identify any insurance deficiency shall not relieve Seller from, nor be construed or deemed a waiver of, its obligation to maintain the required insurance at all times during the performance of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 18  
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

18.1 Definition of Confidential Information. The following constitutes “Confidential Information,” whether oral or written which is delivered by Seller to Buyer or by Buyer to Seller including: (a) pricing and other commercially-sensitive or proprietary information provided to or from Buyer in connection with the terms and conditions of, proposals and negotiations related to, this Agreement, and (b) information that either Seller or Buyer stamps or otherwise identifies as “confidential” or “proprietary” before disclosing it to the other. Confidential Information does not include (i) information that was publicly available at the time of the disclosure, other than as a result of a disclosure in breach of this Agreement; (ii) information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the recipient after the time of delivery; (iii) information that was rightfully in the possession of the recipient (without confidential or proprietary restriction) at the time of delivery or that becomes available to the recipient from a source not subject to any restriction against disclosing such information to the recipient; and (iv) information that the recipient independently developed without a violation of this Agreement.

18.2 Duty to Maintain Confidentiality. Except as permitted in this Article 18, neither Party shall disclose Confidential Information to a third party, except upon the written consent of the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information will retain its character as Confidential Information but may be disclosed by the recipient (the “Receiving Party”) if and to the extent such disclosure is required (a) to be made by any requirements of Law, (b) pursuant to an order of a court or (c) in order to enforce or implement this Agreement. If the Receiving Party becomes legally compelled (by interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoenas, summons, civil investigative demands, or similar processes or otherwise in connection with any litigation or to comply with any applicable Law, order, regulation, ruling, regulatory request, accounting disclosure rule or standard or any exchange, control area or

18.3 Irreparable Injury; Remedies. Receiving Party acknowledges that its obligations hereunder are necessary and reasonable in order to protect Disclosing Party and the business of Disclosing Party, and expressly acknowledges that monetary damages may be inadequate to compensate Disclosing Party for any breach or threatened breach by Receiving Party of any covenants and agreements set forth herein. Accordingly, Receiving Party acknowledges that any such breach or threatened breach may cause irreparable injury to Disclosing Party and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be available, in Law, in equity or otherwise, Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages.

18.4 Permitted Disclosures. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 18, Confidential Information may be disclosed by either Party to such Party’s counsel, accountants, auditors, advisors, other professional consultants, credit rating agencies, Affiliates or actual or prospective owners, investors, lenders, directors, underwriters, contractors, suppliers or others involved in the construction, operation and financing transactions and arrangements for a Party or its affiliates, or any of its or their agents, consultants or trustees, so long as the person to whom Confidential Information is disclosed agrees in writing to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Article 18 to the same extent as if it were a Party, or is bound by substantially similar confidentiality requirements.

18.5 Press Releases. Neither Party shall issue (or cause its Affiliates to issue) a press release regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless both Parties have agreed upon the contents of any such public statement.

ARTICLE 19
MISCELLANEOUS

19.1 Entire Agreement; Integration; Exhibits. This Agreement, together with the Cover Sheet and Exhibits attached hereto, constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between Seller and Buyer with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements relating to the subject matter hereof, which are of no further force or effect. The Exhibits attached hereto are integral parts hereof and are made a part of this Agreement by reference. The headings used herein are for convenience and reference purposes only. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of the Cover Sheet or any Exhibit, the provisions of first the Cover Sheet, and then this Agreement shall prevail, and such Exhibit shall be corrected accordingly.

19.3 No Waiver. Waiver by a Party of any default by the other Party shall not be construed as a waiver of any other default.

19.4 No Agency, Partnership, Joint Venture or Lease. Seller and the agents and employees of Seller shall, in the performance of this Agreement, act in an independent capacity and not as officers or employees or agents of Buyer. Under this Agreement, Seller and Buyer intend to act as energy service provider and energy service recipient, respectively, and do not intend to be treated as, and shall not act as, partners in, co-venturers in or lessor/lessee with respect to the Facility or any business related to the Facility.

19.6 Mobile-Sierra. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party shall seek, nor shall they support, any third party seeking to prospectively or retroactively revise the rates, terms or conditions of service of this Agreement through application or complaint to FERC pursuant to the provisions of Section 205, 206 or 306 of the Federal Power Act, or any other provisions of the Federal Power Act, absent prior written agreement of the Parties. Further, absent the prior written agreement in writing by both Parties, the standard of review for changes to the rates, terms or conditions of service of this Agreement proposed by a Party shall be the “public interest” standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 U.S. 332 (1956) and Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 U.S. 348 (1956).

19.9 Binding Effect. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

19.10 Change in Electric Market Design.

(a) If a change in the CAISO Tariff renders this Agreement or any provisions hereof incapable of being performed or administered, then any Party may request that Buyer and Seller enter into negotiations to make the minimum changes to this Agreement necessary to make this Agreement capable of being performed and administered, while attempting to preserve to the maximum extent possible the benefits, burdens, and obligations set forth in this Agreement as of the Effective Date. Upon delivery of such a request, Buyer and Seller shall engage in such negotiations in good faith. If Buyer and Seller are unable, within sixty (60) days after delivery of such request, to agree upon changes to this Agreement or to resolve issues relating to changes to this Agreement, then any Party may submit issues pertaining to changes to this Agreement to the dispute resolution process set forth in Article 15. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a change in cost shall not in and of itself be deemed to render this Agreement or any of the provisions hereof incapable of being performed or administered, or constitute, or form the basis of, a Force Majeure Event, and (ii) all of unaffected provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect during any period of such negotiation or dispute resolution.

(b) If the Point of Interconnection and/or any of the Transmission Systems utilized to deliver Product to the Delivery Point under this Agreement are (i) integrated into a new or existing regional transmission organization or independent system operator (other than the CAISO Balancing Authority), or (ii) leave a regional transmission organization or independent system operator, and such integration has a material and adverse impact on either Party’s performance under this Agreement, including the costs of either Party to perform, then the affected Party may request that Buyer and Seller enter into negotiations to make the minimum changes to this Agreement necessary to restore the balance of benefits, burdens, and obligations set forth in this Agreement as of the Effective Date. Upon delivery of such a request, Buyer and Seller shall engage in such negotiations in good faith; provided, that neither Party shall be obligated to amend this Agreement if such amendment(s) would materially adversely affect, or could reasonably be expected to have or result in a material adverse effect on, any of such Party’s rights, benefits, risks and/or obligations under this Agreement.

If Seller elects to extend the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, on or before the date that is five (5) Business Days prior to the then-current Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, Seller shall provide Notice and payment to Buyer of the Delay Damages for the number of days of extension to the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date (“Delay Damages Payment”); provided such Delay Damages Payment may, at Seller’s option, be in the form of cash or an irrevocable, standby letter of credit issued by a U.S. commercial bank, or a foreign bank with a U.S. branch, with such bank having a Credit Rating of at least A- with an outlook designation of “stable” from S&P or A3 with an outlook designation of “stable” from Moody’s, which letter of credit Buyer may draw on to receive such Delay Damages Payment. If Seller achieves Commercial Operation prior to the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date as extended by the payment of the Delay Damages Payment, Buyer shall refund to Seller in cash the Delay Damages for each day Seller achieves Commercial Operation prior to the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, as extended, times the Delay Damages, not to exceed the total amount of the Delay Damages Payment paid by Seller pursuant to this Section 2(b). The Parties agree that Buyer’s receipt of Delay Damages shall not be construed as Buyer’s declaration that an Event of Default has occurred under any provision of Section 11.1.

3. **Termination for Failure to Achieve Commercial Operation.** If the Facility has not achieved Commercial Operation by the Outside Commercial Operation Date, either Party may elect to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 2.6.

4. **Extension of the Guaranteed Dates.** The Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date shall, subject to notice and documentation requirements set forth below, be automatically extended on a day-for-day basis (the “Development Cure Period”) for the following delays:

   a. delays due to a Force Majeure Event;

   b. delays caused by a Transmission Provider not caused by the Seller’s action or inaction;

   c. delays in the completion of the Interconnection Facilities or the commercial operation date of the SunZia Transmission Line, in each case not caused by Seller’s action or inaction; or

   d. delay due to a Buyer breach or default under this Agreement.

   The cumulative extensions granted under clauses 4(a), 4(b) and 4(c) of the Development Cure Period shall not exceed __________ for any reason, including a Force Majeure Event. The extension granted under clause 4(d) of the Development Cure Period shall have no termination. Except to the extent Seller has paid Delay Damages, or due to a delay clause 4(d) of the Development Cure Period, no extension under the Development Cure Period, no extension shall be given if (i) the delay was the result of Seller’s failure to take all commercially reasonable actions to meet its specified deadlines, (ii) Seller failed to provide requested documentation as provided below, or (iii) Seller failed to provide Notice to Buyer as required in the next sentence. Seller shall provide prompt Notice to Buyer of a delay, but in no case more than thirty (30) days after Seller becomes aware of such delay, except that in the case of a delay occurring within sixty (60) days of the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, or after such date, Seller must provide Notice within five (5) Business Days of Seller becoming aware of such delay. Upon request from Buyer, Seller shall provide documentation demonstrating to Buyer’s reasonable satisfaction that the delays described above did not result from Seller’s actions or failure to take commercially reasonable actions.

5. **Failure to Reach Guaranteed Capacity.** If, at Commercial Operation, one hundred percent (100%) of the Guaranteed Capacity has not been completed and is not ready to produce and deliver Product to Buyer, Seller shall have one hundred eighty (180) days after the Commercial Operation Date to install additional capacity and/or network upgrades such that the Installed Capacity is equal to at least the Guaranteed Capacity. In the event that Seller fails to construct the Guaranteed Capacity by such date, Seller shall pay “Capacity Damages” to Buyer, in an amount equal to __________ for each MW that the Guaranteed Capacity exceeds the Installed Capacity and the Guaranteed Capacity and other applicable portions of the Agreement shall be adjusted accordingly.

![EXHIBIT E ENERGY REPLACEMENT DAMAGES CALCULATION](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=EXHIBIT+E+ENERGY+REPLACEMENT+DAMAGES+CALCULATION)

In accordance with Section 4.7, if Seller fails to achieve the Guaranteed Energy Production during any Performance Measurement Period, and Seller elects to not provide Replacement Product, a liquidated damages (“Energy Replacement Damages”) payment shall be due from Seller to Buyer, calculated as follows:

\[
[(A - B) * (C - D)] - E
\]

where:

- **A** = the Guaranteed Energy Production amount for the Performance Measurement Period, in MWh
- **B** = the Adjusted Energy Production amount for the Performance Measurement Period, in MWh
- **C** = Replacement price for the Performance Measurement Period, in $/MWh, which is the sum of (a) the simple average of the LMP in the Day-Ahead Market at the Delivery Point for all of the hours in the Performance Measurement Period, plus (b) the simple average REC Price for the applicable Performance Measurement Period.
- **D** = the Contract Price, in $/MWh
- **E** = the value of any Replacement Product provided retrospectively by Seller with respect to such Performance Measurement Period

“Adjusted Energy Production” shall mean the sum of the following: (i) the greater of (a) if Seller provided Replacement Product or paid Energy Replacement Damages during the prior Performance Measurement Period, seventy five percent (75%) of the Expected Energy for the Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period or (b) the Delivered Energy plus Lost Output plus Deemed Delivered Energy in the first Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period, plus (ii) Delivered Energy plus Lost Output plus Deemed Delivered Energy in the second Contract Year of the current Performance Measurement Period.

“Lost Output” means the sum of electric energy in MWh that would have been generated and delivered, but was not, on account of Forced Facility Outage (not caused by Seller’s fault or negligence), Force Majeure Events, System Emergencies, Buyer’s failure to perform, and Curtailment Order. The additional MWh comprising Lost Output shall be calculated in the same manner as Deemed Delivered Energy.

No payment shall be due if the calculation of (A - B) or (C - D) yields a negative number.

Exhibit E-1

<!-- Page 209 -->
Within sixty (60) days after each Contract Year, Buyer will send Seller Notice of the amount of damages owing, if any, which shall be payable to Buyer before the later of (a) thirty (30) days of such Notice and (b) ninety (90) days after each Contract Year.

(d) In the event that (i) an Assigned Agreement is rejected by a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving the Assignors or (ii) an Assigned Agreement is terminated as a result of any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving the Assignors, and if after such rejection or termination, (A) prior to the Construction Loan Discharge Date, the Construction Collateral Agent, or (B) on or following the Construction Loan Discharge Date, the LCRA Collateral Agent, in each case, any designee of such Collateral Agent that has become the owner of the rights of the applicable Assignors in the Projects or applicable Project, as applicable, shall request and shall certify in writing to Company, not more than sixty (60) days after the date when such rejection or termination, as applicable, occurs, that it will perform the obligations of the applicable Assignors as and to the extent required under the applicable Assigned Agreements, Company and such Collateral Agent or such designee shall execute and deliver to one another a new agreement(s) (a “New Assigned Agreement”), pursuant to which New Assigned Agreement, Company shall agree to perform the remaining obligations contemplated to be performed by Company under the applicable original Assigned Agreements, and the applicable Collateral Agent or such designee shall agree to perform the remaining obligations contemplated to be performed by such Assignors under such original Assigned Agreements, and which shall be for the balance of the remaining term under such original Assigned Agreements before giving effect to such rejection or termination and shall contain the same conditions, agreements, terms, provisions and limitations as such original Assigned Agreements (except for any requirements which have been fulfilled by such Assignors or Company prior to such rejection or termination).

If the applicable Collateral Agent or its successor(s), assignee(s), or designee(s) is prohibited by any court order, stay or injunction, or bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings of the applicable Assignor from curing the Default or from commencing or prosecuting such proceedings, then the foregoing time periods shall be extended by the period of such prohibition.

![EXHIBIT J FORM OF LIMITED ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1085.png?text=EXHIBIT+J+FORM+OF+LIMITED+ASSIGNMENT+AGREEMENT)

This Limited Assignment Agreement (this “Assignment Agreement” or “Agreement”) is entered into as of [____], by and among [____], a [____] (“PPA Seller”), Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a municipal utility district organized under the provisions of the Municipal Utility District Act (Division 6, Chapter 2, Articles 2 and 3, Sections 11581 through 11614 of the California Public Utilities Code, as amended) (“PPA Buyer”), and J. Aron & Company LLC, a New York limited liability company (“J. Aron”), and relates to that certain power purchase agreement between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller as further described in Appendix 1 (the “PPA”). Unless the context otherwise specifies or requires, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the PPA.

In consideration of the premises above and the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, PPA Seller, PPA Buyer and J. Aron (the “Parties” hereto; each is a “Party”) agree as follows:

1. Limited Assignment and Delegation.

(a) PPA Buyer hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to J. Aron all right, title and interest in and to the rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA to receive delivery of the products described on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Products”) during the Assignment Period (as defined in Appendix 1), as such rights may be limited or further described in the “Further Information” section on Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Product Rights”). All Assigned Products shall be delivered pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement during the Assignment Period as provided in Appendix 1. All other rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly reserved for PPA Buyer. The Parties agree that the assignment, transfer and/or conveyance of all or any portion of the Assigned Products in accordance with this Agreement and the Parties’ performance of any obligation in accordance with this Agreement shall not constitute a failure to meet the requirements of the PPA, or a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty under the PPA (and in no event shall PPA Seller be responsible for any failure of any portion of the Assigned Products to satisfy the requirements of the PPA, to the extent such failure results from the assignment, transfer and/or conveyance of such Assigned Products in accordance with this Agreement).

(b) PPA Buyer hereby delegates to J. Aron the obligation to pay the APC Contract Price set forth in Appendix 1 for all Assigned Products that are actually delivered to J. Aron pursuant to the Assigned Product Rights during the Assignment Period (the “Delivered Product Payment Obligation” and together with the Assigned Product Rights, collectively the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”); provided that (i) all other obligations of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly retained by PPA Buyer and PPA Buyer shall be solely responsible for any amounts due to PPA Seller that are not directly related to Assigned Products; and (ii) the Parties acknowledge and agree that PPA Seller will only be obligated to deliver a single consolidated invoice during the Assignment Period (with a copy to J. Aron consistent with Section 1(d) hereof). To the extent J. Aron fails to pay for any Assigned Products by the due date for payment set forth in the PPA, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, PPA Buyer agrees that it will remain jointly and severally responsible as a primary obligor (and not as a surety) for such payment and that it will be an Event of Default pursuant to Section 11.1(a) if PPA Buyer does not make such payment within
<!-- Page 241 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1085.png?text=Document+Image) 

five (5) Business Days (as defined in the PPA) of receiving notice of such non-payment from PPA Seller, and that PPA Buyer shall remain liable for, and indemnify and hold PPA Seller harmless from, any and all losses, damages, costs and expenses of PPA Seller of any kind as a result of or arising from (x) the assignment, transfer, conveyance, and delegation described in Section 1(a) and this Section 1(b), or (y) J. Aron’s failure to take or pay for any such Assigned Product or make any payment in respect of the Delivered Product Payment Obligation as and when due under the PPA and disregarding the effects of any stay or other suspension rights, including without limitation under sections 362 or 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or similar laws, whether due to bankruptcy, insolvency or any other cause.

(c) J. Aron hereby accepts and PPA Seller hereby consents and agrees to the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delegation described in clauses (a) and (b) above.

(d) All scheduling of Assigned Products and other communications related to the PPA shall take place between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller pursuant to the terms of the PPA; provided that (i) title to Assigned Product will pass from PPA Seller to J. Aron upon delivery by PPA Seller of Assigned Product in accordance with the PPA; (ii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any Notice of a Force Majeure Event or Event of Default or default, breach or other occurrence that, if not cured within the applicable grace period, could result in an Event of Default contemporaneously upon delivery thereof to PPA Seller and promptly after receipt thereof from PPA Seller; (iii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to J. Aron of any forecasts of Energy generation provided by PPA Seller under the PPA; (iv) PPA Seller will provide copies to J. Aron of all invoices and supporting data provided to PPA Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1 of the PPA, provided that any payment adjustments or subsequent reconciliations occurring after the date that is 10 days prior to the payment due date for a monthly invoice, including pursuant to Section 8.4 of the PPA, will be resolved solely between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller and therefore PPA Seller will not be obligated to deliver copies of any communications relating thereto to J. Aron; and (v) PPA Buyer and PPA Seller, as applicable, will provide copies to J. Aron of any other information reasonably requested by J. Aron relating to Assigned Products.

(e) PPA Seller acknowledges that (i) J. Aron intends to immediately transfer title to any Assigned Products received from PPA Seller through one or more intermediaries such that all Assigned Products will be re-delivered to PPA Buyer; and (ii) in the event that PPA Buyer fails to pay the relevant intermediary entity for any such Assigned Products, the receivables owed by PPA Buyer for such Assigned Products (“PPA Buyer Receivables”) may be transferred to J. Aron. To the extent any such PPA Buyer Receivables are transferred to J. Aron, J. Aron may transfer such PPA Buyer Receivables to PPA Seller and apply the face amount thereof as a reduction to any Delivered Product Payment Obligation, and PPA Buyer waives all rights to dispute or claim any defence in respect of such PPA Buyer Receivables other than a defence that would have arisen under the PPA if this Agreement were not in effect. To effect such transfer, J. Aron shall deliver to PPA Seller a notice of intent to transfer PPA Buyer Receivables not later than the payment due date for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation and shall deliver to PPA Seller a bill of sale signed by J. Aron not later than five Business Days thereafter, provided that no such transfer or application shall reduce or limit PPA Buyer’s obligations under Section1(b) above. Such transfer of PPA Buyer Receivables shall immediately be deemed an Event of Default under Section 11.1(a) of the PPA, without regard to any cure periods set forth therein, and PPA Seller shall be entitled to pursue collection on such PPA Buyer Receivables.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1085.png?text=Document+Image)

directly against PPA Buyer pursuant to the remedies set forth in the PPA for such Event of Default.

(f) On or before the commencement of the Assignment Period, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Guarantor”) will issue, in favor of PPA Seller, a guaranty of J. Aron’s payment obligations under this Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Appendix 3 attached hereto (“Guaranty”).

(g) The Assigned Prepay Quantity set forth in Appendix 2 relates to obligations by and between J. Aron and PPA Buyer and has no impact on PPA Seller’s rights and obligations under the PPA.

(h) In the event that the PPA or the Assigned Rights and obligations are either or both rejected or terminated in or as a result of any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar proceeding affecting J. Aron, PPA Buyer shall, at the option of PPA Seller exercised within thirty (30) days after such rejection or termination, enter into a new agreement with PPA Seller having identical terms as the PPA (subject to any conforming changes necessitated by the substitution of parties and other changes as the parties may mutually agree), provided, that the term under such new agreement shall be no longer than the remaining balance of the term specified in the PPA.

2. Assignment Early Termination.

(a) The Assignment Period may be terminated early upon the occurrence of any of the following:

(1) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by either J. Aron or PPA Buyer to each of the other Parties;

(2) delivery of a written notice of termination specifying a termination date by PPA Seller to each of J. Aron and PPA Buyer following J. Aron’s failure to pay when due any amounts owed to PPA Seller in respect of any Delivered Product Payment Obligation and such payment is not made by J. Aron within one (1) business day following receipt by J. Aron and PPA Buyer of written notice;

(3) delivery of a written notice by PPA Seller if any of the events described in the definition of “Bankrupt” in the PPA occurs with respect to J. Aron; or

(b) The Assignment Period will end at the end of last delivery hour on the date specified in the termination notice provided pursuant to Section 2(a), which date shall not be earlier than the end of the last day of the calendar month in which such notice is delivered if termination is pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) or 2(a)(2) above. All Assigned Rights and Obligations shall revert from J. Aron to PPA Buyer upon the early termination of the Assignment Period, provided that (i) J. Aron shall remain responsible for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation with respect to any Assigned Product delivered to J. Aron prior to the end of the Assignment Period, and (ii) any legal restrictions on the effectiveness of such reversion (whether arising under bankruptcy law or otherwise) shall not affect the expiration or early termination of the Assignment Period.

NAME  
ADDRESS  

Attention:

Ladies and Gentlemen:

For value received, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Guarantor”), a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, hereby unconditionally guarantees the prompt and complete payment when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations and liabilities, whether now in existence or hereafter arising, of J. Aron & Company LLC, a subsidiary of the Guarantor and a limited liability company duly organized under the laws of the State of New York (the “Company”), to COUNTERPARTY NAME (the “Counterparty”) arising out of or under the Limited Assignment Agreement among the Company, the Counterparty and [PPA Seller] dated as of [ | , 202_]. This Guaranty is one of payment and not of collection.

The Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and notice of any obligation or liability to which it may apply, and waives presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any such obligation or liability, suit or the taking of other action by Counterparty against, and any other notice to, the Company, the Guarantor or others.

Counterparty may at any time and from time to time without notice to or consent of the Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder: (1) agree with the Company to make any change in the terms of any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (2) take or fail to take any action of any kind in respect of any security for any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (3) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company or others, or (4) compromise or subordinate any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty including any security therefor. Any other suretyship defenses are hereby waived by the Guarantor.

This Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect until the opening of business on the fifth business day after Counterparty receives written notice of termination from the Guarantor. It is understood and agreed, however, that notwithstanding any such termination this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the obligations and liabilities set forth above which shall have been incurred prior to such termination.

Exhibit J-2  
84ET-387782
<!-- Page 250 -->
![Guaranty Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Guaranty+Document)

The Guarantor further agrees that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the guaranteed obligations, or interest thereon is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Counterparty upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or reorganization of the Company. No failure on the part of the Counterparty to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Counterparty of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power. Notwithstanding anything in this Guaranty to the contrary, this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or shall be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time, either before or after the termination hereof, payment of the obligations or liabilities guaranteed pursuant to this Guaranty, or any part thereof, is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by Counterparty for any reason, including without limitation upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or the Guarantor, all as though such payment had not been made.

Except as to applicable statutes of limitation, Guarantor hereby agrees that no delay of Counterparty in the exercise of, or failure to exercise, any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such rights, a waiver of any other rights or a release of Guarantor from any obligations hereunder.

No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, waived or supplemented except in a writing signed by Guarantor and Counterparty.

The Guarantor hereby represents as follows:

(a) The Guarantor is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Guaranty have been and remain duly authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of the Guarantor's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, as amended to date, or any law, regulation, decree, order, judgment, resolution or any contractual restriction binding on the Guarantor or its assets that could affect, in a materially adverse manner, the ability of the Guarantor to perform any of its obligations hereunder.

(c) All consents, licenses, clearances, authorizations, and approvals of, and registration and declarations with, any governmental or regulatory authority necessary for the due execution and delivery of this Guaranty have been obtained and remain in full force and effect and all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental or regulatory authority is required in connection with the execution or delivery of this Guaranty.

(d) This Guaranty constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with all of its terms and conditions (subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar law).

**Exhibit J-4**  
**THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.**  

The Guarantor may not assign its rights or delegate its obligations under this Guaranty, in whole or in part, without prior written consent of the Counterparty, and any purported assignment or delegation absent such consent is void, except for (i) an assignment and delegation of all of the Guarantor’s rights and obligations hereunder in whatever form the Guarantor determines may be appropriate to a partnership, corporation, trust or other organization in whatever form that succeeds to all or substantially all of the Guarantor’s assets and business and that assumes such obligations by contract, operation of law or otherwise, and (ii) the Guarantor may transfer this Guaranty or any interest or obligation of the Guarantor in or under this Guaranty, or any property securing this Guaranty, to another entity as transferee as part of the resolution, restructuring or reorganization of the Guarantor upon or following the Guarantor becoming subject to a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding. Upon any such delegation and assumption or transfer of obligations, the Guarantor shall be relieved of and fully discharged from all obligations hereunder, whether such obligations arose before or after such delegation and assumption or transfer.

**THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. GUARANTOR AGREES TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, OVER ANY DISPUTES ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY.**

In the event the Guarantor becomes subject to a proceeding under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together, the "U.S. Special Resolution Regimes"), the transfer of this Guaranty, and any interest and obligation in or under, and any property securing this Guaranty, from the Guarantor will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Guaranty, and any interest and obligation in or under this Guaranty, were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event the Company or the Guarantor, or any of their affiliates, becomes subject to a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, default rights against the Company or the Guarantor with respect to this Guaranty are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such default rights could be exercised under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Guaranty was governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.

Very truly yours,

**PRINCIPLES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT**

SMUD is committed to developing carbon free renewable energy in a manner that supports the community, protects the environment, and respects human rights. This document provides guidance on the key objectives that SMUD expects to achieve associated with this commitment. Renewable energy projects engaged in a commercial relationship with SMUD such as a power purchase agreement will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, implement, and maintain throughout the associated term, a “Community Benefits Plan” that addresses how the project will achieve the key objectives identified herein.

**Key objectives:**

1. **Land Use:** Prioritize previously developed lands. Avoid or minimize impacts on sensitive environmental resources, including but not limited to cultural resources, tribal cultural resources, and biological resources such as endangered species habitat, vernal pools and other sensitive habitats, “Waters of the US”, “Waters of the State” and waters identified by California Department of Fish and Wildlife as “Streambed”. Provide additional mitigation measures if avoidance and minimization measures cannot fully eliminate impacts. Applicants are expected to discuss these topics with both SMUD and the lead agency as early as possible to identify potential associated issues in advance of the purchase power agreement being finalized.

2. **Land Use:** All projects should employ techniques for maintaining and/or restoring ecosystem function to the site in conjunction with renewable energy outcomes, including establishment of native vegetation, restricting use of herbicides and pesticides, use of grazing for vegetation management and seasonally appropriate maintenance practices. Where development is on or surrounded by agricultural lands the project should also employ agricultural practices on the property during operations including sheep grazing, dry crop farming and irrigated food production where feasible.

3. **Land Use:** Employ design and construction practices that minimize ground disturbance to the maximum extent possible. This is especially critical in areas where cultural, tribal and biological resources are of significant concern.

4. **Sustainable Life Cycle Management:** Include plans for sustainable life cycle management of construction materials and project components during construction and operation that provides for recycling and reuse of construction waste and waste during operation including but not limited to the solar panels.

5. **Community Benefits:**

   (a) **Inclusive Economic Development:** Leverage SMUD’s Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) team to connect with certified small business vendors/contractors in SMUD’s service territory to support the project. Submit requests to seed.mgr@smud.org.

# Board Monitoring Report 2024  
## SD-16 Information Management and Security  

1) **Background**  

Strategic Direction Information Management and Security policy states that:  

Proper management of cyber and physical information, as well as physical security, is a core value. Robust information management and physical security practices are critical to effective risk management and to ensure regulatory compliance, business resiliency and customer satisfaction. SMUD shall take prudent and reasonable measures to accomplish the following:  

a) **Information Security:** SMUD will protect customer, employee and third-party information, and SMUD information systems are protected from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.  

b) **Physical Security:** SMUD will safeguard its employees while at work as well as customers and visitors at SMUD facilities. SMUD will also protect its facilities and functions that support the reliability of the electric system and overall operation of the organization from unauthorized access or disruption of business operations.  

c) **Customer Privacy:** SMUD will annually notify customers about the collection, use and dissemination of sensitive and confidential customer information. Except as provided by law or for a business purpose, SMUD will not disseminate sensitive and confidential customer information to a third party for non-SMUD business purposes unless the customer first consents to the release of the information. Where sensitive and confidential information is disseminated for a business purpose, SMUD will ensure: (i) the third party has robust information practices to protect the sensitive and confidential customer information, and (ii) use of the information by the third party is limited to SMUD’s business purpose. SMUD will maintain a process that identifies the business purposes for which SMUD will collect, use and disseminate sensitive and confidential customer information.  

d) **Records Management:** SMUD will maintain the efficient and systematic control of the creation, capture, identification, receipt, maintenance, use, disposition, and destruction of SMUD records, in accordance with legal requirements and Board policies.  

2) **Executive summary**  

a) SMUD’s Information Security, Physical Security, Customer Privacy, and Records Management programs and initiatives align directly with the “Safety and Reliability” Core Values of SMUD’s 2030 Clean Energy Plan. These programs work towards ensuring

3) Additional supporting information

**Information Security**

SMUD, customer, employee and third-party information and SMUD information systems are protected from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

SMUD’s Cybersecurity program, under the direction of the Chief Information Security Officer, continues to evolve and mature to keep pace with the evolving cyber threats we face and to manage our cyber, privacy, legal, regulatory and compliance risk. This includes the adoption of a Zero Trust Architecture strategy, aligned to the CIOs larger IT Strategic Plan. We align to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to establish prudent and reasonable measures intended to protect SMUD’s operations from a cyber-attack, disruption and other threats to enterprise technologies, processes, and information. The CSF has been updated to now have six core functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover, and Govern) which comprise both administrative and technical controls to effectively manage information and cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity is actively working to implement the CSF controls through SMUD policies to enhance and govern information management and security risk management practices and processes in support of SD-16. Cybersecurity will highlight the cybersecurity capabilities provided in an update to the board for SD-16 during an upcoming closed session.

**Physical Security**

SMUD will safeguard its employees while at work as well as customers and visitors at SMUD facilities.

SMUD facilities welcome thousands of community members through community events, meetings, and face-to-face interactions in addition to being the home of nearly 2300 employees.

![SMUD Security Operations Report](https://example.com/image.png)

SMUD’s Security Operations continues to meet its goal of maintaining customer and employee safety by leveraging physical security staff, video surveillance technology, lighting and signage, passive and active physical security barriers, education and partnerships with law enforcement and community stakeholders.

This year, SMUD authored and implemented a comprehensive new Visitor Control and Management policy. This policy outlines the requirements for planning, coordinating, escorting and approving visits throughout SMUD. The new policy ensures uniform, consistent, safe and efficient processes for visitors and SMUD employees. SMUD additionally added an enhanced Workplace Violence Prevention policy and training for all employees. These safeguards and policies ensure that safety remains priority one at SMUD. As with most new policies and procedures, these will be updated appropriately when needed to reflect the ever-changing threat landscape.

SMUD will also protect its facilities and functions that support the reliability of the electric system and overall operation of the organization from unauthorized access or disruption of business operations.

Security Operations has identified a new thermal imaging technology that will be used to supplement existing intrusion detection methods at substations and other sites where false alarms have been rampant. This system “sees” things thermally and then directs a camera to the detected object for the Security Dispatcher to assess. This will help with an aging fiber optic sensor system that has been giving widespread false alarms for years. The resulting drain on resources and unnecessary patrol response has been a costly issue, and introducing this new system should reduce those problems significantly. This is part of a larger effort to use metrics-gathering tools to increase operational efficiency, identify trends and hotspots, and increase visibility of emergent issues, particularly at our Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) sites.

**Customer Privacy**

SMUD will annually notify customers about the collection, use and dissemination of sensitive and confidential customer information.

SMUD sent out our annual privacy notice via email and as a bill insert to customers during the May bill cycle. The language in the notice was updated this year to emphasize that any non-SMUD business uses of personal information require individual consent. The notice is otherwise very similar to previous years and continues to include plain language regarding SMUD’s collection, use, and release of customer sensitive and confidential information, the business purposes for which customer information is used, as well as a reaffirmation of SMUD’s commitment to customer privacy.

Except as provided by law or for a business purpose, SMUD will not disseminate sensitive and confidential customer information to a third party for non-SMUD business purposes unless the customer first consents to the release of the.

GM 24-163 Board Monitoring Report – SD-16, Information Management and Security Page 4 of 8
<!-- Page 268 -->
![GM 24-163 Board Monitoring Report – SD-16, Information Management and Security Page 5 of 8](attachment://image.png)

No sensitive and confidential customer information has been sent to a third party for non-SMUD business purposes this year.

Where sensitive and confidential information is disseminated for a business purpose, SMUD will ensure: (i) the third party has robust information practices to protect the sensitive and confidential customer information, and (ii) use of the information by the third party is limited to SMUD’s business purpose.

Cybersecurity and Procurement continue to follow a formalized supply chain risk management process, in compliance with NERC CIP requirements. The process is aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and is reviewed on at least an annual basis to ensure it is functioning as designed and incorporates lessons learned as new procurements follow the process. The process includes a mandatory procurement requirement for vendors to allow the Cybersecurity team to evaluate the security posture of a proposed vendor solution. The American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) Service Organization Control 2 (SOC 2) Type 2 continues to be our procurement standard as it is an independent assessment focused on a solution’s security controls which includes tests of the security controls’ efficacy. SOC 2 Type 2 reports provide staff confidence that vendor security controls are robust and sufficient to protect SMUD information. Contract and non-disclosure agreement language is used to provide assurance that SMUD provided sensitive and confidential information will not be used for any unapproved purposes. Additionally, our data sharing policy and process also align to this requirement.

SMUD will maintain a process that identifies the business purposes for which SMUD will collect, use and disseminate sensitive and confidential customer information.

MP 07.03.01.122 - Data Sharing requires an approved data sharing request prior to sharing information with a third party for SMUD business purposes. No significant policy or process changes related to data sharing occurred this year.

Records Management

The efficient and systematic control of the creation, capture, identification, receipt, maintenance, use, disposition, and destruction of SMUD records, in accordance with legal requirements and Board policies.

The IMC Program in collaboration with the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) team launched a mass content migration (Enterprise Shared Drive Migration) project at the beginning of 2023. Using completed IMC records evaluations, this effort has migrated or is in the process of migrating content from 29 business areas out of the 41 business areas in scope, for an estimated total of 4.5 million documents classified and migrated. The project identifies, organizes, and migrates content for each business area from non-approved records repositories.

into approved record repositories. This allows content to be managed in accordance with SD-16.

The IMC program is continuing to partner with IT to review and support new software integrations to ensure they meet records policies and information management requirements. This is imperative as new software often produces and stores records outside of official repositories. IMC has been added to the purchase approval process to support this effort.

The IMC Program continues to collaborate with the Enterprise Content Management team, Cybersecurity, the CIP Program, Data Governance, and other business partners to ensure compliance with records policies and information management requirements.

**4) Challenges**

**Information Security**  
Our federal partners (FBI) continue to warn us of the heightened geopolitical tension and the nation state cyber actors targeting critical infrastructure that led to the “Shields Up” declaration from the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) from 2022, stressing the continued need to focus on maturing our cybersecurity posture. The Cybersecurity team continued to work this past year with numerous IT teams to follow CISA guidance to help manage the cyber risk. Internally facing awareness campaigns continue to remind staff of the risks we’re facing and the role they play in keeping our systems and data protected. In addition to the technical controls put in place, cybersecurity again partnered with other departments to ensure our cyber insurance coverage is maintained.

SMUD’s Payment Card Industry (PCI) card payment transaction volume makes SMUD a PCI Level 2 Merchant. This year the new updated version 4 of the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) went live. As determined by an independent third-party PCI Qualified Security Assessor, we are compliant with the new version. Our required assessment documents attesting to our compliance with the updated standards were submitted to Chase Paymentech in June.

The Cybersecurity team continues to work hard to ensure compliance with the NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) standards. Additional standards become enforceable in 2025 and subsequent years which will require additional resources from the Cybersecurity team and other teams as well.

Ransomware continues to be a threat, and in response SMUD Cybersecurity has continued to mature our Cybersecurity Emergency Operations Program (CEOP), performing annual exercises to ensure our teams understand the plan and are prepared to execute it in the event of a security incident. The exercises highlight ways we can improve our processes.

Cybersecurity’s Zero-Trust Strategy is a core part of the larger IT strategy, and better positions SMUD to secure sensitive data, systems, and services. IT continues to make progress in this area, working with Cybersecurity to ensure upcoming projects and efforts align to this strategy.
<!-- Page 270 -->
![Physical Security](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Physical Security**  
Physical Security is a first line of defense against any unauthorized intrusions at our facilities. With the ever-changing international and domestic threat landscape, as well as the significant increase in unsafe activity located near SMUD campuses, sub-stations and other assets, the risk of outside impacts to SMUD assets and field staff continues to increase. SMUD Security Operations continues to invest in technology, increased training and adoption of best practices as well as partnerships with local and federal law enforcement and local community and government agencies to ensure we are prepared to meet and withstand current threat conditions in support of our employees, physical assets and the community we serve.

SMUD continues to grow as an organization in size and reputation, gaining national and international attention as one of the best public utilities in the world and as an economic development driver in the Sacramento region. As such, our infrastructure and facilities footprint continue to grow as we move toward our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. As SMUD continues to grow our influence, impact and footprint, our threat exposure grows as well.

SMUD Security Operations continues to work to ensure compliance with the NERC CIP standards while meeting the SMUD Strategic Directives. Balancing SMUD’s management of critical CIP areas while maintaining our role as a community convener and customer facing campus will continue to offer challenges. As CIP standards are adopted in 2025 and into the future, SMUD Security Operations will continue to evaluate our program to ensure that SMUD continues to have sufficient resources from a personnel, technology and security infrastructure standpoint to meet future needs, responsibilities and conditions.

**Customer Privacy**  
SMUD continues to see requests for SMUD customer data to be used and shared for additional purposes and programs, including customer personally identifiable information (PII). SMUD’s Data Sharing Policy and process are in place to provide request tracking and approval to ensure that all sharing of PII is authorized and that transmission is performed using an approved and secure transfer mechanism.

**Records Management**  
The IMC program continues to integrate information management best practices into SMUD’s daily operations. Business areas are actively collaborating with IMC in the creation of information management and recordkeeping polices/procedures specific to their day-to-day operational needs. SMUD’s continued development of the IMC program further reduces the risk of potential multi-million-dollar fines and reputational damage associated with lack of records management controls.

The Enterprise Shared Drive Migration project which launched at the beginning of 2023 (expected to end in 2025) is a large undertaking that involves the mass organization and migration of content from Enterprise shared drives to approved SMUD information repositories. IMC in collaboration with the ECM team is working diligently to ensure completion of the project tasks by business areas and ease the learning curve that comes with these implemented changes.

**President Herber then called for public comment items not on the agenda.**

Robert Wichert stated he ran for Ward 1 in the recent election with the platform that rate increases are too high. He stated he was aware of the Board’s policy to keep rates below PG&E’s rates. He requested that the Board adopt a formal policy to keep rate increases below inflation.

**President Herber then turned to Directors’ Reports.**

Director Sanborn reported on her attendance at the Impact 100 Greater Sacramento Annual Celebration and the American Leadership Forum Exemplary Leaders Dinner. She reported that she had joined the CivicWell Board as the first utility representative and on her attendance, along with Vice President Fishman, at the Carmichael Chamber’s Best of Carmichael Dinner where she accepted an award on behalf of SMUD for Favorite Utility. She concluded by reporting on her attendance at the Tails of Twilight Gala, which is the annual fundraiser for the Friends of Front Street Animal Shelter, and encouraged those interested to donate to Front Street Animal Shelter in light of their recent study identifying the need for a new shelter with more space.

Director Tamayo reported on his participation in the Asian Pacific Chamber’s internal study mission as well as his attendance at the Asian Community Center where he accepted an award on behalf of SMUD.

She concluded by reporting on her attendance at the German Marshall Fund Alumni Dinner.

Director Rose thanked Mr. Wichert for attending the meeting and noted that as of October, SMUD’s rates were 58.8% below PG&E’s. He then reported on his attendance at the Nehemiah Emerging Leaders Anniversary Celebration, the Future of Folsom event organized by the Folsom Chamber of Commerce, the Sacramento Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) Gala, and the Elk Grove Veterans Day Parade. He concluded by thanking staff for their work on the number of Board Committee meetings held in November.

President Herber thanked staff for the information and briefings provided regarding SMUD’s budget and the Board Office for their assistance and support in the past year. She then reported on her participation in a clean energy entrepreneur conference where she moderated a panel, her attendance at a Leadership Sacramento class, her attendance at the Street Soccer Anniversary Cup Celebration where she accepted an award on behalf of SMUD, and her speaking event at the Capital Storytelling’s Immigrant Stories event.

Paul Lau, Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, congratulated incoming President Fishman and Vice President Tamayo. He then reported on the following items:

1) Native American Heritage Month, Diwali, and Veterans Day.
   
   This month, we recognized Native American Heritage Month, Diwali and Veterans Day. Throughout November, we are
<!-- Page 280 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/1265x768.png?text=Image+not+available)

recognizing the rich ancestry and vibrant traditions of Native Americans. We honor the legacy that Indigenous history makers have left – and those who continue to shape our society, lead their communities and impact our culture today. Also this month, our Groups Reaching Across International Networks, or GRAIN, Employee Resource Group organized a gathering to celebrate Diwali, which is the Hindu Festival of Lights. Employees got to learn about the history and enjoy traditional Diwali foods. Finally, we proudly celebrated Veterans Day. SMUD’s Military Employee Resource Group and other SMUD employees participated in the Elk Grove community parade. Thank you, Director Rose, for joining us. To SMUD’s many veterans, thank you for your service and to all of the veterans across the U.S., thank you for your service!

2) **Zero Carbon.** Some great news to share on our journey to zero carbon. I am excited to share that our 2023 power mix was on average 78% carbon-free and about 45% renewable under the Renewables Portfolio Standard. In comparison, our Power Content Label in 2022 was 51% carbon-free and 24% renewable. That means we are seeing a 27% increase in carbon-free power! It is pretty amazing that we were able to up our renewables from 24% to 45%. The amount of carbon-free energy can change from year to year based on a number of factors, particularly the weather, and we had a great hydro year in 2023. We can also attribute this success to new solar and geothermal resources and procuring more short-term renewable contracts on the market itself. This is encouraging news as we continue to pursue our road to zero! These are the lowest carbon emissions we have had, I think, in SMUD’s history! Thank you to the Board for your vision and to the staff for your hard work.
<!-- Page 281 -->
3) **Winter Storms Preparation**. With the turn of the season here, teams around SMUD are taking a coordinated response to be prepared for winter storms. We held a mock storm event to make sure we are ready for what is ahead, and teams learned about what is new and improved this year related to our storm response efforts and practiced how to successfully work with one another during a storm event. Over the past two years, we have continued to upgrade processes, procedures and train additional staff in order to enhance our coordinated approach to storm restoration and provide an even better customer experience for our whole community. I think you heard from our Chief Operating Officer Frankie McDermott how we have increased participation from 24 first responders to over 130, and he is constantly looking to see how we can bring more people in so that our staff can go out and assess the damage and give a better restoration time as quickly as we can to our customers, which we know is very, very important.

4) **Utility Insights**. We have been busy connecting with some of the top utility leaders to share insights and collaborate on strategies to achieve a clean energy future. We hosted an Energy Thought Summit with Zpryme, generally known as ETS, right here at SMUD. Director Bui-Thompson was instrumental on convincing Zpryme and ETS to have a second event outside of Texas to be in California. She was on the planning committee, she got everybody together and worked to make sure we had a very, very successful ETS event in Sacramento. Chief Operating Officer Frankie McDermott and Director Bui-Thompson and many of our staff participated in many panels, and I was honored to be one of the keynote speaking events. We also had many other SMUD staff speak at this event and share their expertise with the 50+ attendees. I think what is
<!-- Page 282 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/1265x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

1. **Importance of Events**: It is crucial for other utilities, manufacturers, and interested parties to advance zero carbon initiatives by learning from each other to avoid reinventing the wheel and to accelerate decarbonization efforts.

2. **SMUD Events**: In November, SMUD hosted the Sustainable Communities Partnership Summit and a Contractor Network Appreciation event. These events showcased collaboration with the community to influence and support clean energy. The Summit brought together 96 local nonprofit partners to share best practices and discuss future collaboration. The Contractor Network event recognized 6,700 completed projects by 345 contractors and provided updates on progress toward 2030 goals.

3. **Awards**: Celebrations included the 15-year anniversary of the Nehemiah Emerging Leaders Program, where Rhonda Staley-Brooks was honored as the first Outstanding Alumni award recipient. At the WE3 Summit, SMUD received the Strategic Digital Transformation Award, and Suresh Kotha was named Tech Leader of the Year. The author received the Industry Visionary of the Year award.

4. **Board Video**: This month’s video features one from the Clean Energy Key Terms series, which includes animated explanations.

- 2025 SMUD Budget Resolution

**Summary: 2025 Budget Resolution**  
The 2025 Proposed SMUD Budget Resolution is comprised of Operations and Maintenance budget of $1,463.9 million, Debt Service budget of $505.4 million, and Capital budget of $612 million. The proposed 2025 Budget Resolution limits spending to $2,281.3 million (total of prior amounts), plus 10% contingency, plus the commodity contingency and adjustments for Hydro Generation Adjustment transfers or revenue, Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) energy delivery shortfall, and higher retail sales. Additionally, SMUD participates in regulatory programs such as Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and Cap-and-Trade. When SMUD collects revenues through these program’s sales, it is required to apply the proceeds toward specific expenses that support the program’s goals. Should actual sales proceeds exceed the budgeted amount for these programs, the budgeted amount may be increased to match the sales proceeds without the prior specific approval of this Board. The proposed resolution also limits authorized permanent full-time positions to 2,300 plus 5 percent.

**Public Good Charge**  
The Public Goods Charge shall be adjusted for expenditures of $104.8 million, which exceeds the minimum of 2.85% of 1994 revenues. The percentage allocation for the public goods charge expenditures shall apply to low-income assistance, energy efficiency, research and development, and new renewable generation.

**2025 Debt Resolution**  
The 2025 Proposed Debt Resolution contains the official Declaration of Intent to Issue Debt to create $400 million of additional bonding authority to reimburse for qualifying capital expenditures. The resolution also contains the Official Intent to reimburse for 2025, 2024 and 2023 capital expenditures from bond proceeds, which is required to maintain tax-exempt financing capability.

**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and execute a sole source contract with Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to provide market and technical research services to SMUD for the five-year period from January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2029, for a not-to-exceed amount of $6 million.

**Summary:**  
EPRI is a non-profit organization, funded by utility membership participation in its research activities. EPRI members represent more than 90% of the electricity generated and delivered in the U.S. In 2022, SMUD entered into a Master Agreement for EPRI Membership Participation, the terms of which govern the research selected under the 2025-2029 Research Portfolio Agreement. SMUD is a member of EPRI and has for many years evaluated EPRI’s annual programs to determine if they bring value to SMUD and are aligned with SMUD research plans for that given year. Past research areas that SMUD joined have included renewable resources and integration, electric transportation and energy storage. This request is to authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and execute a sole source contract with EPRI over multiple years (2025-2029) for a not-to-exceed amount of $6 million. Under the existing Master Agreement with EPRI, these may include agreements necessary to participate in EPRI’s Annual Research Portfolio and EPRI’s supplemental projects and to procure EPRI’s services. In the past, SMUD has taken one-year agreements with EPRI to the Board, but this five-year approach results in a 25% discount on the EPRI program prices to SMUD. For 2025, SMUD Research & Development (R&D) staff have selected the following EPRI collaborative research, development and demonstration (RD&D) programs. Over the next five years, SMUD retains flexibility to add additional programs of value and R&D will help the enterprise assess the optimal portfolio of programs for each year. The following table contains the program selections identified by SMUD R&D staff for 2025. Specific program areas for subsequent years will be determined by SMUD staff based on value to SMUD and alignment with SMUD research plans:

| Research Area | Program | Program Description | Price |
|---|---|---|---|
| Advanced Generation | 221 | Bulk Energy Storage | $32,480 |
| Advanced Generation | 222 | Advanced Generation & Carbon Capture and Storage | $32,480 |
| Renewable Energy | 208 | Hydropower Generation | $32,480 |
| Thermal Optimization and Emissions Controls | 223 | Heat Rate and Flexibility: Generation Fleet Optimization | $32,479 |
| Transmission and Substations | 34 | Transmission Asset Management Analytics | $29,513 |
| Transmission and Substations | 173 | Bulk System Integration of Renewables and DERS | $70,425 |
| Transmission and Substations | 37.114 | Substation Physical Security | $6,875 |

# Board Monitoring Report 2024  
## SD-11, Public Power Business Model  

### 1. Background  
Strategic Direction 11, Public Power Business Model states that:  
Supporting and strengthening the public power business model is a core value. Local decision making and flexibility are essential to effective and responsible local governance. Community-owned utilities are primarily accountable to their customers, not stockholders. Community citizens have a direct voice in public power decisions.  

Preservation of this business model is vital to ensure public power systems continue to provide innovative solutions tailored to best meet the needs of their customers and communities.  

### 2. Executive Summary  
**SMUD is in compliance with SD-11.**  

The SD-11 monitoring report updates the Board on our efforts to insulate SMUD from issues that may impact our local governance and provide the Board with a final status report on 2024 issues impacting this strategic directive. SMUD’s interests are advanced in the legislative and regulatory arenas to the greatest extent possible. For instance, SMUD meets with key federal and state officials, both elected and appointed, with the driving purpose of educating them on the impact of new and existing policy.  

**State Legislative.** SMUD had several victories this year in the California Legislature that advanced the public power business model to ensure local decision making and flexibility. SMUD sponsored legislation to extend our nonstock security authority for another 10 years [Assembly Bill (AB) 2457] and also defended against legislation that would have forced publicly-owned utilities (POUs) to allow attachments to utility poles without appropriate safeguards in place if a short-shot-clock approval timeline was not met [AB 2221]. SMUD also worked through our trade associations to remove notification requirements for hot work [AB 3062] and reduce the scope of a bill seeking to cap the amount of money utilities can recover for new housing construction service [Senate Bill (SB) 1210].  

**State Regulatory.** SMUD engaged in numerous proceedings before state agencies this year, chiefly the California Energy Commission (CEC) and California Air Resources Board (CARB), to advance the public power business model. Most notably, SMUD and our associations advocated for several amendments to CARB’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). The LCFS encourages the use of low and zero carbon transportation fuels through a declining limit on carbon intensity. SMUD uses revenue from monetizing LCFS credits to fund numerous transportation electrification programs and projects. CARB approved the proposed amendments to the LCFS program at a hearing on November 8. We expect these changes will provide SMUD with a greater number of LCFS credits, increase LCFS credit prices, and maintain flexibility in utility spending requirements.  

SMUD tracked and participated in numerous agency proceedings for opportunities to advance SMUD’s strategic directives, protect jurisdictional limits, and monitor potential changes to industry standards. These include, but are not limited to:  
- CARB’s Cap-and-Trade pre-rulemaking proceeding (ongoing) where SMUD continues

- to advocate to preserve allowance allocations for POUs and flexibility regarding allowance disposition.
- CEC’s Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) and Distributed Electricity Backup Assets (DEBA) program implementation, where SMUD and the California Municipal Utilities Association (CMUA) influenced program guidelines and solicitations to provide greater flexibility for POU-administered programs and dedicated funding for projects in POU service areas.
- CEC’s Power Source Disclosure (PSD) rulemaking proceeding (currently ongoing), where SMUD and our associations are advocating to ensure that implementation of hourly greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting requirements and other changes to the PSD program are accurate and within the statutory authority. Additionally, SMUD has supported pathways for recognizing carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) in the Power Content Label (PCL), which are based on data reported in the PSD program.
- State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) rulemaking to develop statewide utility wildfire general order, where SMUD and our associations are advocating for balanced regulatory oversight for only those utility activities that pose a risk to water quality.
- CEC’s Load Management Standards (LMS) regulation and implementation, which required coordination with other California utilities in the development of a single statewide tool and continued coordination with CEC staff on SMUD’s LMS Compliance Plan.

In 2023, SMUD and our associations successfully influenced the CARB’s Advanced Clean Fleets regulation, which requires public agencies and large commercial fleets to transition all medium- and heavy-duty (MHD) vehicles to zero-emission beginning in 2024. SMUD has continued to work with our associations on the implementation of AB 1594 (Garcia), which provides regulatory flexibility to publicly owned utilities for the purchase of traditional utility-specialized vehicles that are needed to maintain reliable service.

Federal. In 2023, SMUD was awarded a $50 million grant from the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) Program which will help fund our Connected Clean PowerCity Project. This year, SMUD worked to negotiate the terms of the award with the Department of Energy for the $142 million project to develop the next generation of smart grid infrastructure, executing the grant agreement on September 30. Once completed, the Connected Clean PowerCity project will showcase public power’s ingenuity by deploying a technology ecosystem enabling interactive energy management relationships between SMUD and our customers. SMUD submitted two applications in the second round of GRIP funding and worked to secure support from the federal delegation for the proposals. In October, SMUD was notified that it was not selected for a second round award.

On the legislative front, SMUD has joined other utilities in advocating for permitting reform legislation. Throughout the year, permitting reform was frequently discussed, but a formal legislative proposal remained elusive until July, when Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Joe Manchin III (D-WV) and Ranking Member John Barrasso (R-WY) introduced a bill that was quickly advanced through their committee. Unfortunately, the legislation includes a provision to subject not-for-profit electric utilities like SMUD to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for purposes of interregional planning and cost allocation. SMUD expressed serious concerns with this provision to Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA), who sits on the Committee. Chairman Manchin pledged to continue discussions about public power’s concerns about the provision, but the final disposition will not be known until legislators return to Washington, D.C. for a lame duck session after the November.

elections.

In the regulatory arena, SMUD tracked and weighed in on the implementation of tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, particularly the implementation of the “elective pay” mechanism for not-for-profit utilities to receive cash payments for eligible projects since they have no tax burden to offset and the development of the new 45V tax credit for hydrogen production. SMUD also worked with numerous coalitions to follow the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) final rule to curb greenhouse gases from new and existing fossil-fueled power plants. Finally, SMUD engaged with its national trade association, the American Public Power Association (APPA), to provide feedback on a proposal by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s (CISA) to require onerous and duplicative reporting of cyber incidents.

SMUD also continued engagement with FERC on dockets related to cost allocation and transmission planning. SMUD continues to develop its enterprise-wide grant capture program to respond to federal funding opportunity announcements and build relationships with key officials and new offices within the DOE in charge of IIJA grant guidance and implementation efforts.

**Community Choice Aggregators (CCA).** AB 117 (2002) created Community Choice Aggregation and authorized local governments to aggregate customer electric load and become the default power provider in the service territory of an incumbent investor-owned utility (IOU). SMUD responded by offering to provide operational services to CCAs.

Today, SMUD offers 11 comprehensive services to CCAs: contact center, billing, debt collections, customer relationship management systems, data management, market research, data analytics, custom reporting, customer programs, electrification concierge, and marketing services. SMUD supports several CCAs, including Pioneer Community Energy, Marin Clean Energy (MCE), East Bay Community Energy, Silicon Valley Clean Energy (SVCE), and San Jose Clean Energy (SJCE). CCAs enable their customers to access many of the same public power benefits that SMUD and other POUs have provided millions of Californians. Our support of CCAs promotes public power. CCAs also have aggressive carbon reduction goals similar to SMUD’s. Our support of CCAs promotes carbon reduction regionally. SMUD is leveraging our decades of experience as a utility, staff expertise, and existing systems to provide skilled services to CCAs, generating new revenue and strengthening SMUD’s ability to provide cost effective public power service to our customers. There are currently over 25 active CCAs in California, representing nearly half of the state, and additional ones exploring or investigating the feasibility of starting a new CCA. The potential for new CCA clients for SMUD is great.

SMUD continues to see significant benefits with its participation in the CAISO’s Western Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) since joining in 2019 through the Balancing Authority of Northern California (BANC). On March 25, 2021, the remaining BANC Balancing Authority Area (BAA) footprint joined the EIM. This broader BANC resource participation has resulted in greater economic benefits and a better ability to integrate and manage intermittent resources within the BANC footprint.

SMUD and BANC, as well as other EIM participants, have supported the extension of the EIM real-time framework to the CAISO’s day ahead market under the CAISO’s Extended Day Ahead Market (EDAM) initiative. After a few years of discussions, direct involvement with the CAISO and a handful of other stakeholders, and broader stakeholder meetings to develop an EDAM proposal, the CAISO filed a tariff amendment with FERC in August 2023 which FERC approved in June. EDAM implementation activities have begun with EDAM launch planned for Spring of

2026. SMUD plans to join EDAM with the other BANC participants beginning in 2027.

To support EDAM, and further development of a west-wide market, multiple state commissioners in the west, including California, issued a letter to the Western Interstate Energy Board in summer of 2023 calling for the creation of an independent entity that could serve as a means of delivering a market for western states. A West-Wide Governance Pathways Initiative (Pathways Initiative) was created, and a broad stakeholder committee has proposed a multi-step process to create an independent governing body that would enable a path forward for a potential west-wide fully organized market (a Regional Transmission Organization, or RTO). An independent governing body is seen by many entities outside of California as critical to participating in EDAM and other future markets. Earlier in 2024, as the first step, the CAISO approved elevating the EIM/EDAM Governing Body joint authority with the CAISO Board to primary authority over EIM/EDAM market matters. The second step is creation of a non-profit entity and transfer of governance authority over EIM/EDAM markets from the CAISO to this new “Regional Organization.” This will occur after California legislation is introduced in 2025, and if approved, it amends existing California law applicable to the CAISO governance. And step 3 is potential continued future expansion of regionalized functions and services offered by the Regional Organization. SMUD views EDAM, and the Pathways Initiative, as important steps forward in the evolution of Western energy markets and it aligns well with SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan goals.

As SMUD’s Strategic Plan indicates, internal and external factors are driving our business and shaping our public business model. Legislative and regulatory uncertainty continues to be a threat to the Public Power Business Model (SD-11). SMUD takes positions on legislation and regulations based on the Board’s Strategic Direction.

### 3. Additional Supporting Information
Local decision making and flexibility are essential to effective and responsible local governance. We continued to guard local decision-making and flexibility as we pursue innovative solutions that meet the needs of our customers and our community. High priority 2024 issues are as follows:
- Meetings with state legislators to highlight SMUD’s legislative priorities to advance the public power business model.
- Sponsoring legislation to extend SMUD’s nonstock security authority.
- Securing amendments to remove applicability of onerous requirements to SMUD (e.g., AB 2221, AB 3062, SB 1210).
- Grants capture initiatives to support SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan, including the GRIP II grant, the Recompete grant, and Matsui earmark.
- Advocating for favorable outcomes in the federal appropriations process, which determines the level of funding available for high-priority grant programs authorized in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
- Defending against proposals to reverse the direct pay provisions enacted in the IRA.
- Meetings with CEC Commissioners to educate key policy decision-makers on activities and needs related to SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan, including transportation electrification, building electrification, and load flexibility, to advance the public power business model.
- Advocating to preserve POU allowance allocations and flexibility regarding allowance value within the Cap-and-Trade program.

GM 24-176 Board Monitoring Report – SD-11, Public Power Business Model Page 4 of 18
<!-- Page 320 -->
- Continued outreach to the CEC regarding SMUD’s compliance approach to the Load Management Standards regulation, as well as the development of SMUD’s revised compliance plan.
- Working with the California Electric Transportation Coalition (CalETC) and partners to encourage changes to strengthen the LCFS program and update utility spending requirements.
- Advocating for a balanced regulatory approach regarding the SWRCB’s Draft Utility Wildfire General Order.

4. Challenges:

SMUD continues to face prescriptive legislative and regulatory mandates for carbon reduction, renewable energy, resources planning, and building and vehicle electrification, in part because of the State’s robust climate change goals and their potential interplay with pending federal regulations. With SMUD customers still struggling as energy costs continue to rise, it is particularly important to defend against mandates that increase costs for SMUD.

While state policy is increasingly recognizing the importance of a diverse set of resources to reliably and affordably achieve electric sector decarbonization goals, uncertainty remains regarding the definition of “zero-carbon resources,” particularly emerging technologies, for purposes of the state’s long-term goals. This uncertainty and potential lag time in updating state policy and regulations may pose some challenges for SMUD, as a POU that is making early investments in emerging technologies to support decarbonization goals that are faster than those of the state. The CEC is in the process of developing the next SB 100 Joint Agency Report, which is evaluating the tradeoffs of various scenarios – including one with no combustion of biogas, carbon capture, or hydrogen – to inform state policymakers. SMUD will continue to advocate for policies that recognize the renewable and zero-carbon resources needed to decarbonize our grid.

Changes to Cap-and-Trade are on the horizon, and CARB staff has signaled both a need to reduce allowance allocations and the potential for more prescriptive requirements regarding the disposition of allowance value. In addition, the CEC has initiated a rulemaking to implement hourly GHG emissions accounting and reporting requirements for SMUD and other large utilities as part of the Power Source Disclosure program. The new requirements are highly complex, and it is critical to ensure that implementation is accurate, understandable, and fair.

SMUD will continue to advocate for the advancement of beneficial transportation and building electrification, along with consideration of utility needs for accelerating the enabling infrastructure. Transportation electrification has been a priority for the Newsom Administration, with Governor Newsom’s executive order to require that all new cars and passenger trucks sold in California be zero-emission vehicles by 2035 and CARB’s Advanced Clean Cars II regulation that took effect at the end of 2022.

Additionally, SMUD continues to monitor CPUC proceedings that may attempt to assert jurisdiction over POUs (e.g., pole and conduits database, demand flexibility through dynamic rates, discharge permitting for electric utility maintenance tasks, resiliency activities, and General Orders).

5. Recommendation

It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-11.

# State Legislation that Impacted SD-11

## AB 2457 (McCarty) – Nonstock Security Authority
SMUD-sponsored legislation, AB 2457, which extends the sunset and limit on the number of acquisitions under our current pilot project authority, granted through AB 689 in 2019 that allows us to hold nonstock security in a corporation or other private entity under certain conditions.

**Status:** Signed by the Governor

**SMUD Position:** Sponsor. SMUD drafted the legislative language, developed and executed the legislative strategy, led all advocacy, testified in legislative committees, and developed a large support coalition of 18 organizations.

**Staff Comment:** New programs are often met with resistance from the legislature, particularly on more complicated topics such as nonstock security. While we initially sought to completely remove the sunset, rather than extend it, the passage of this bill is a significant victory for SMUD. We will be able to continue with this innovative authority to potentially seek additional financial upside in our various partnerships. Importantly, the bill also explicitly allows us to include services or access to SMUD facilities (e.g., workforce development training) as something SMUD can provide in exchange for nonstock security. This is a helpful clarification to existing law.

## AB 2221 (J. Carrillo) – Broadband Pole Attachments
AB 2221, sponsored by Crown Castle, sought to install problematic, burdensome, and limiting timelines (called shot clocks) for broadband pole attachment applications. If utilities did not approve or deny the pole attachment applications in accordance with the shot clocks, the applications would be deemed approved. SMUD worked with CMUA in opposing this bill, and the bill was held in the Assembly Appropriations Committee and died.

**Status:** Dead

**SMUD Position:** Worked through the California Municipal Utilities Association in opposing the bill.

**Staff Comment:** This bill would have had very significant safety implications. This was Crown Castle’s second bite at the apple – as their AB 965 last year sought to institute similar provisions, but we were able to successfully get publicly owned utilities removed from that bill. SMUD worked closely with a coalition of publicly owned utilities to defeat this bill this year as well.

## AB 3062 (Bauer-Kahan) – Hot Work Notification
AB 3062, as introduced, would have required utilities to provide 24 hours’ notice to fire protection agencies before performing any hot work. The bill was amended in the Assembly Utilities and Energy Committee and was limited to providing this notice at least 24 hours in advance of a controlled or prescribed burn.

**Status:** Signed by Governor

**SMUD Position:** SMUD worked through the California Municipal Utilities Association to oppose this bill.

<!-- Page 322 -->
![Board Monitoring Report – SD-11, Public Power Business Model](https://example.com/image-url)

unless it was limited to controlled burns only. Once the amendments were in print, the California Municipal Utilities Association moved to neutral.

**Staff Comment:** While SMUD always coordinates closely with relevant agencies in our work, this bill as introduced would have imposed an additional bureaucratic requirement for performing our routine maintenance and managing our infrastructure. Limiting the notification or prescribed burns is much more reasonable, particularly since prescribed burns are usually conducted by the Bureau of Land Management, United States Forest Service or Cal Fire, and not SMUD.

**AB 2619 (Connolly) – Net Energy Metering**  
AB 2619 would have required the California Public Utilities Commission to develop by 2027 a new solar tariff to replace the current tariff (e.g., Net Energy Metering (NEM) 3.0). The bill would have reverted all NEM 3.0 customers to the prior NEM 2.0 tariff until the new tariff was developed.

**Status:** This bill was never heard in committee and is dead.  
**SMUD Position:** Watch  
**Staff Comment:** SMUD was neutral on the bill but watched very closely. The author said the bill was not intended to impact publicly owned utilities but the language was not as clear as we would have liked.

**Energy Resources Surcharge**  
The Governor proposed a budget trailer bill to assess additional fees on the delivery of electricity to fund the CEC. The Energy Resources Surcharge Law imposes a surcharge on consumers for the consumption of electricity purchased from an electric utility at a rate annually fixed by the CEC not to exceed a surcharge rate cap of $0.0003/kilowatt-hour, which the CEC states costs the average customer about $2 per year. This bill would have expanded the applicability of the surcharge to additionally include the consumption of electricity generated by solar energy systems that are connected to the grid and would increase the surcharge rate cap from $0.0003 per kilowatt-hour to $0.0006 per kilowatt-hour, which would be subject to an annual adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index.

**Status:** Much to the CEC’s chagrin, the Governor’s Office and legislative leadership held the proposal for this year.  
**SMUD Position:** SMUD worked closely with CMUA and other publicly-owned utilities to seek revisions from the CEC.  
**Staff Comment:** Not only were we concerned with the doubling of the surcharge, but the methodology for including solar customers would be technologically challenging and confusing for our customers.

**AB 2037 (Papan) – Weights and Measures: Electric Vehicle Chargers**  
AB 2037 authorizes county sealers to test and verify as correct electrical vehicle (EV) chargers operated by a public agency that is located in the county in which the sealer has jurisdiction. If the EV charger is found to be incorrect, the bill requires the county sealer to mark it with a tag and require the charger to be repaired or corrected. This is only related to the weights and measures of the EV charger, not the operation of the charger, which was a point of confusion with the bill as it moved through the legislature. The bill seeks to ensure the right amount is charged to customers for the amount of electricity consumed – similar to what is done at gas stations.

**Status:** Signed by Governor

**GM 24-176**

<!-- Page 323 -->
![SMUD Position: Worked with the author to secure amendments. Staff Comment: Though SMUD’s eFuel program, we offer leases on EV chargers for commercial customers. Thanks to help from the Board, we were successful in securing an amendment to make sure the operator of that leased charger is responsible for the bill's requirements, as opposed to SMUD. SMUD also worked with CMUA on amendments to allow publicly-owned utilities to self-verify the accuracy of our commercially available EV chargers. The author accepted these amendments, but instead of requiring the verification to occur every two years, like it does for the County Sealer, the author wants publicly-owned utilities to verify our chargers every six months, which is where the bill language ultimately landed. Taxpayer Deception Act There was a significant ballot measure that SMUD watched closely this year. Called the Taxpayer Protection Act by its proponents and Taxpayer Deception Act by the opposition, this initiative would have changed voter thresholds for fee and tax increases and, importantly for us, would have changed our “reasonable cost of service” metric to “actual cost of service.” Status: The initiative was removed from the November 2024 ballot by the California Supreme Court in a ruling that came out in late June. The Court stated that the initiative would have substantially altered the state’s basic plan of government and, therefore, cannot be enacted by initiative. It is rather governed by the procedures to revise the California Constitution. SMUD Position: SMUD watched very closely but did not take an official position. The California Special Districts Association (CSDA), of which SMUD is a member, was heavily involved, filing an amicus brief to the California Supreme Court. Staff Comment: The impacts of the initiative, if passed, were far-reaching and broad – a significant threat to the public power business model and SMUD’s ability to set rates and provide reliable and safe electricity to our customers. AB 1465 (Wicks) – Title V Fee Increases AB 1465 increases existing air district civil penalty limits by a factor of up to three for emissions from a Title V source that contain one or more air contaminants. Status: Signed by the Governor SMUD Position: SMUD worked through CMUA in opposition to this bill last year, and it was held. The bill was brought back in the 11th hour this year and passed quickly. Staff Comment: If a SMUD Title V emissions source was found to be in violation, the local air district may impose penalties that are triple the current rate. Typically, penalties are now assessed at $5,000 per day ($15,000 by January 1, 2025). Working with CMUA, SMUD was able to get a letter on record that clarifies that this does not apply during declared emergencies. AB 2204 (Bennett) - Hydrogen AB 2204 sought to impose a concept called the 3 pillars, which would require all hydrogen produced or used in California to be from new and incremental renewable generation resources, include temporal matching of renewable generation resources, and geographic deliverability of renewable energy resources. Status: Dead. GM 24-176 Board Monitoring Report – SD-11, Public Power Business Model Page 8 of 18**
<!-- Page 324 -->
![SMUD Position: SMUD did not have an official position.](https://example.com/image1)

**Staff Comment:** SMUD worked with the Northern California Power Agency, the building trades, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems (also known as ARCHES, a public/private partnership to create a hydrogen hub in California) to meet with members of the legislature to share our concerns with the 3 pillars model, primarily that it could make it more difficult for federal dollars to flow to California.

**SB 1210 (Skinner) – New Housing Construction**  
SB 1210 initially would have imposed a cap on how much utilities can recover to provide service and upgrade capacity to serve new housing construction. The cap would have been one percent of the reported building permit value of a housing unit. The bill was ultimately amended to focus more on transparency of fees – the bill requires utilities to post on their websites both the schedule of estimated fees for typical service connections as well as the estimated time frames for completing service connections.

**Status:** Signed by the Governor

**SMUD Position:** SMUD worked with CMUA to express concerns with the bill as initially drafted.

**Staff Comment:** The bill as initially written was in conflict with how utilities provide service to new housing construction.

**State Regulation that Impacted SD-11**

**Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program**  
The LCFS is a market-based program designed to encourage the use and production of low carbon transportation fuels. The LCFS is a market-based program that is based on declining carbon intensity (CI) benchmarks; transportation fuels that have a CI lower than the benchmark generate LCFS credits, and those with a higher CI generate credit deficits. LCFS credits associated with electricity can be generated in several categories, depending on the type and location of the charging; proceeds must generally support transportation electrification projects or programs. Utilities, including SMUD, currently receive “base credits” that are allocated based on estimated EV charging within their service areas. A minimum portion of these base credits fund the statewide Clean Fuel Reward (CFR) program; the remaining “holdback” credits fund utility-specific programs, with minimum spending requirements for projects benefiting low-income and disadvantaged communities. SMUD also generates credits through partnerships with dairies that produce digester gas for low-carbon electricity.

CARB started a formal rulemaking process in January 2024 with proposed amendments to the LCFS regulatory language. CARB then issued two rounds of changes to the proposed amendments, most recently in October, and approved the amendments at its November 8 hearing.

**Status:** CARB’s adopted amendments to the LCFS regulation will go into effect in 2025. There were several important changes to the LCFS program. First, CARB increased the stringency of the program, which is designed to displace the use of additional fossil fuels and potentially increase LCFS credit prices. Additionally, the regulatory changes will allow SMUD to retain a greater number of credits, contributing fewer credits to the statewide CFR program, and also preserve flexibility in how SMUD spends the credit value. CARB staff have indicated that they do not anticipate any further amendments to the LCFS program until after CARB’s next Scoping Plan Update, which is expected to occur in 2027.

# Cap-and-Trade Amendments (Pre-Rulemaking)

The Cap-and-Trade program is a key element of California’s strategy to reduce GHG emissions by setting an economy-wide, declining cap on annual GHG emissions. Covered entities must surrender compliance instruments, or allowances, for each metric ton of GHG emissions. The current regulation provides SMUD, and other electric utilities, a specified amount of directly allocated allowances through 2030 to mitigate the cost impacts to ratepayers of compliance with the Cap-and-Trade program. As a POU, SMUD has the option of depositing allowances to meet our compliance obligations or consigning allowances to auction and using the proceeds to benefit ratepayers, in accordance with certain regulatory requirements.

Over the past two years, CARB has engaged in pre-rulemaking activities for potential updates to the Cap-and-Trade regulation. The primary objective of the update is to align the Cap-and-Trade program with CARB's 2022 Scoping Plan Update, which calls for additional emissions reductions by 2030 in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. As part of the update, CARB will also consider changes to improve program implementation. While CARB has not yet proposed any formal amendments, potential changes under consideration that are key to SMUD include:

- Reductions to allowance budgets, including utility allowance allocations, through 2030.
- Reduced flexibility for POUs to either consign allowances to auction or deposit for compliance.
- Reduced flexibility for POUs regarding use of allowance proceeds.

POU allowance allocations provide important ratepayer benefits and are critical to advancing the state’s GHG reduction goals. Reductions in allowance allocations may directly impact ratepayers during a time when the state is suffering from an affordability crisis. SMUD and our associations have urged CARB to minimize changes to utility allowance allocations to the extent possible. SMUD also does not support changes that would require POUs to consign allowances and restrict proceeds, preserving POUs flexibility to determine how best to use allowance value is the most efficient, effective, and suitable way to respond to local communities’ needs and reduce GHG emissions in our service areas.

**Status:** CARB has held several pre-rulemaking workshops but has not yet released draft regulatory amendments. The formal rulemaking is expected to begin in late 2024.

# Power Source Disclosure Amendments

SB 1158 (Becker) established new hourly GHG reporting requirements for retail suppliers of electricity, including SMUD, which the CEC is tasked with implementing. Under the new law, retail suppliers will be required to report the following information beginning January 1, 2028:

- Sources of electricity used to serve hourly loss-adjusted retail load.
- The GHG emissions associated with each source.
- Annual total and average GHG emissions intensity.
- Annual avoided GHG emissions.

In May 2024, the CEC issued proposed amendments to the Power Source Disclosure (PSD) program to update the PSD program, incorporate the requirements of SB 1158, and make changes to the Power Content Label (PCL) that relies on data reported through the PSD program. SMUD submitted comments both individually and in coordination with CMUA, which highlighted several clarifications necessary to improve accuracy and avoid ambiguity. SMUD also advocated for the inclusion of a pathway for counting natural gas paired with carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS) technology.

The CEC subsequently issued revised proposed amendments in October 2024. These amendments made several of the clarifications requested by SMUD and CMUA, as well as incorporating a new

**Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) Program**  
The CEC’s Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) program was established as part of the Strategic Reliability Reserve created by AB 205 (2022). The program provides incentives to utility customers that provide incremental net load reductions during grid emergencies or extreme events. DSGS providers, which may include POUs, enroll customers and administer the program; depending on the participation option, providers receive administrative cost reimbursement or incentives for committed load reduction capacity. The CEC revised the program guidelines in 2023 to reflect lessons learned, expand eligibility, allow third-party aggregators to serve as program administrators under certain conditions, and pilot new participation options.

The current DSGS program includes three participation pathways, originally designed with the CAISO in mind:  
- **Option 1**, which provides incentives to customers that voluntarily reduce net load in response to Energy Emergency Alerts (EEAs) issued by a California balancing authority (BA).  
- **Option 2**, which provides monthly capacity payments for demand response resources participating in electricity markets that can provide additional load reduction capability.  
- **Option 3**, which provides monthly capacity payments for behind-the-meter battery virtual power plants that dispatch based on market or other reliability-related signals.

SMUD successfully advocated for flexibility allowing non-CAISO balancing authority areas to benefit from the DSGS program and for POUs to propose alternative program requirements that are best suited for the reliability needs of the POU and their BA. In coordination with CMUA, SMUD also successfully advocated for changes requiring third-party aggregators to obtain written permission from the host POU before becoming a DSGS provider, to ensure any DSGS activities are coordinated with POU needs and operations.

In October 2024, the CEC released additional revisions to the DSGS guidelines. The proposed changes would primarily revise certain requirements for Option 3 and add a new Option 4, which would provide an emergency load flexibility virtual power plant (VPP) that would allow participation by smart thermostats and electric water heaters. The proposed DSGS program retains POU flexibility and continues to ensure coordination between DSGS providers and host POUs.

**Status:** SMUD is enrolled as a DSGS provider for “Option 1” and plans to expand the program to additional customers in the future. SMUD supported CMUA comments, submitted October 30, 2024, which generally supported the DSGS program, but sought clarification that DSGS providers will be able to recover administrative costs. The revised DSGS guidelines are expected to be adopted by the CEC in February or March 2025.

**2025 Energy Code – Rulemaking Activities**  
The CEC released the proposed 2025 Energy Code in March 2024. The new code continued the trend toward more heat pump space heating (HPSH) and heat pump water heating (HPWH) through prescriptive requirements for new single-family homes, multifamily, and select nonresidential building types. Separately, the new code proposed a voluntary measure (Part 11) that included a heat pump space heating baseline for alterations of existing single-family homes. The changes also included
<!-- Page 327 -->
![Board Monitoring Report – SD-11, Public Power Business Model](https://example.com/image-url)

updates to efficiency standards and certain photovoltaic and energy storage requirements, including a minor clarification to community solar requirements.

SMUD supported the expansion of heat pump baselines and prescriptive requirements for space and water heating. Additionally, SMUD supported proposed electric ready requirements for new multi-family and non-residential buildings.

**Status:** The CEC adopted the 2025 Energy Code in September 2024 and the requirements will go into effect for construction permits that are applied for on or after January 1, 2026.

### Load Management Standard (LMS) Regulation
The amended LMS regulations were adopted by the CEC in October 2022 and took effect on April 1, 2023, expanding on efforts to increase efficiency and demand flexibility in California’s electricity grid. While the standard has been in statute since 1978, the most recent amendments are intended to form the foundation of a statewide system that automates the creation of hourly or sub-hourly costs and signals that can be used by end-use automation to provide real-time demand flexibility on the grid. The amended regulations require the state’s three largest IOUs and CCAs, the Los Angeles Department of Water, and Power (LADWP) and SMUD to develop marginal cost-based rates that change at least hourly for each customer class that is determined to materially reduce peak load, among other requirements.

During the rulemaking process, SMUD staff advocated to CEC staff, Commissioners, and other key policymakers to help guide the development of the LMS and ensure that SMUD can continue to offer pilots and programs as an alternative to dynamic rates. The final regulations largely reflected our recommendations for a separate compliance pathway for POUs that provides greater implementation flexibility.

SMUD adopted its LMS Compliance Plan and submitted for CEC approval in November 2023. Thereafter, CEC staff indicated that they did not believe that SMUD’s Compliance Plan met the requirements of the LMS regulations, and this ultimately resulted in a Deficiency Notice (Notice) from the CEC’s Executive Director. The Notice indicated the CEC’s view that SMUD must incorporate dynamic rates or programs incorporating dynamic price signals or must update the analysis provided in the Compliance Plan. SMUD is currently preparing a response to the CEC’s letter, which is due in December 2024.

**Status:** The new LMS regulations went into effect in April 2023. This year, SMUD fulfilled several regulatory requirements, including incorporating the Rate Identification Number (RIN) onto customer bills, participated in a joint utility group to develop the concept paper for a “single statewide tool” that would enable customers and third parties to evaluate rates or make rate changes, and submitted a list of load-modifying programs. SMUD will continue preparing a response to the CEC’s Notice and will continue coordination with CEC staff to resolve any issues.

### Draft Utility Wildfire General Order
In June, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) issued the Draft Utility Wildfire and Similar Operations and Maintenance Activities Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification and Waste Discharge Requirements General Order and Associated CEQA EIR (Draft GO). The Draft GO covers twelve “project activities” related to wildfire risk mitigation, response, and cleanup activities that may cause or threaten to cause discharge of waste into waters of the state and applies to these activities even if the activity is not directly related to wildfire. The Draft GO applies to a project activity when the activity causes soil disturbance within specific distances from waters of the state (WOTS) or GM 24-176 Board Monitoring Report – SD-11, Public Power Business Model Page 12 of 18

**Delta Water and Hydro Impacts**

Two substantial Delta planning processes could potentially affect energy available for SMUD's purchase from the Central Valley Project (CVP) and flows within the Upper American River Project (UARP) watershed: the Bay–Delta Water Quality Control Plan (Bay–Delta Plan), and the Delta Conveyance Project (successor to the California WaterFix Project, which was in turn successor to the Bay Delta Conservation Plan).

Phase 2 of the Bay–Delta Plan is ongoing and could potentially affect SMUD by increasing the volume of water required for outflow into the Bay (Phase 3 would, if carried out, implement Phase 2 through modifications to water rights). A substantial change in Delta outflow and tributary flow requirements could, among other things, have a major impact on the timing of hydroelectric energy generation. The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) staff released a draft of one of the Phase 2 documents identifying an environmental need for significantly more outflows (in short, 35 to 75% of all water is allegedly needed for outflow with staff recommending 45 to 65%).

Governor Newsom requested the SWRCB explore negotiation of voluntary agreements with water purveyors in lieu of imposing a strict plan. Work on the voluntary agreements process has been picking up speed and is now known as the Healthy Rivers and Landscapes Program. If adopted by its numerous sponsors and the SWRCB, the program would initiate aquatic habitat restoration and release of flows to support a healthier Delta ecosystem.

Although the earlier, two-tunnel Delta conveyance WaterFix Project was cancelled and its environmental documents rescinded in 2019, the Department of Water Resources (DWR) quickly relaunched the project as a one-tunnel option, renamed the Delta Conveyance Project. The Draft Environmental Impact Report was released in July 2022. The project would involve building one new intake and a tunnel to complement the historical diversion of water through the Delta channels for the State Water Project (SWP). It had been expected the Project would involve the CVP as well, though that does not appear to be the case and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has not been participating, suggesting no CVP power would be used for the project. This is important because if provided by the CVP, power for the estimated 10-year construction effort and long-term operations would come out of supplies otherwise sold to public power contractors, the single largest share of which goes to SMUD under an existing long-term contract (which will be succeeded a new contract). Using the tunnels would be part of an effort to maintain or even increase Delta watershed exports to Southern and Central California. Proponents have claimed the project would help reduce the historical impacts of the South Delta pumps on special status fish species, though modeling by Northern California interests of the prior project suggests the reduced impacts have not been proven and in fact the opposite could be true. Modeling of the
<!-- Page 329 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

newly proposed project is under way. Changes in the timing of the energy generation due to the project are as yet unclear. DWR approved the Project on December 21, 2023.

In the meantime, the Delta Conveyance Project faces numerous legal challenges.  
(1) In January of this year, dozens of plaintiffs filed nine lawsuits challenging the Project approval under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and Sacramento Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction against DWR. This ruling is on appeal.  
(2) Also in January, in another lawsuit the Court held that DWR lacked the authority to fund the project using revenue bonds. This ruling is also on appeal.  
(3) Yet another lawsuit is challenging the SWRCB’s authority to rule on the water rights petitions that DWR filed in support of the Project until another proceeding is completed.

Staff Comment: SMUD is working closely with a coalition of water interests to evaluate the impacts of the Bay–Delta Plan and the Delta Conveyance Project to understand the implications for power generation and SMUD’s water rights and hopefully to agree upon a voluntary agreement process as a substitute for a regulated process. SMUD is also working with DWR on how to serve the Project with power.

Federal Legislation that Impacted SD-11

S. 4753 (Manchin): the “Energy Permitting Reform Act”  
While SMUD has supported the intent of permitting reform proposals, S. 4753 includes a provision that would require public power entities, Power Marketing Administrations, and other non-jurisdictional entities to come under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for purposes of transmission planning and cost allocation. This would upend the regime adopted by FERC in Order 1000 that provides for public power’s voluntary participation in interregional planning, as well as requiring public power entities to file a tariff in order to build a transmission line in a national interest transmission corridor. SMUD expressed concerns about this provision to Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA), who sits on the committee of jurisdiction, and SMUD has coordinated with APPA and the Large Public Power Council (LPPC) to relay the same concerns in their discussions with committees. SMUD will continue to monitor this legislation.

Tax Policy  
As a municipal utility, SMUD relies on municipal bonds and utilizes all available financing mechanisms to decrease the financing costs of infrastructure investments and projects. Therefore, SMUD has continued to advocate for maintaining the longstanding tax exemption for municipal bond interest as well as preserving the ability of municipal utilities to access elective payment of energy tax credits as authorized under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) preserved the general exemption, but removed it for advance refunding bonds, which are used to effectively refinance an original bond. SMUD has worked individually and through coalitions to restore the exemption for advance refunding bonds. Bipartisan bills in both the House and Senate have been proposed that would restore advanced refunding. Such legislation is unlikely to be passed as a stand-alone bill; however, restoring advance refunding may be considered as part of a tax reform package as several tax provisions in the TCJA are set to expire at the end of 2025.

The 2022 IRA includes a provision that allows tax-exempt entities to receive refundable elective payments of various energy tax credits, making them directly available to public power utilities for the first time. Both the House and Senate have introduced provisions in various legislation that would

**repeal energy tax credits authorized under the law; however, none have been advanced. SMUD has worked individually and through coalitions like the American Public Power Association (APPA) and Large Public Power Council (LPPC) to preserve the energy incentives and the ability of municipal utilities to elect elective payment of various energy tax credits. Most recently, Congress passed S.J. Res. 38, a resolution under the Congressional Review Act that would invalidate a secretarial waiver of provisions in the IRA that require a certain percentage of project components to be domestically sourced in order to receive a full elective payment. President Biden vetoed this resolution, preserving the full value of elective payment for projects where a domestic supply chain is infeasible. Federal Affairs will continue to track this issue.**

**H.R. 8790 (Westerman): the Fix Our Forests Act**  
In September, the House passed H.R. 8790, the “Fix Our Forests Act,” which would expedite forest management activities on federal land, including several provisions to allow local governments and special districts to participate in assessing firesheds, provide a categorical exclusion for vegetation management in utility rights-of-way, and automatically approve utility vegetation management plans 120 days after submittal. SMUD Federal Affairs will continue to follow this legislation, although it is unlikely to advance in the Senate.

**Pole Attachments**  
Municipal utilities are exempt from federal regulation of pole attachments under Section 224 of the Federal Communications Act. However, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken steps in recent years that impact public power pole attachments. In September 2018 the FCC issued a declaratory order and ruling interpreting other sections of the law to impose fee limits and timelines on pole attachment applications. Most recently, in March 2022, the FCC approved a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM) on the allocation of pole replacement costs and pole attachment disputes. SMUD has expressed to its delegation concerns about this federal intrusion, noting that it has developed pole attachment agreements with telecom carriers. Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) introduced legislation in January 2019 to nullify the 2018 FCC order, and Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) sponsored similar legislation in the Senate in June 2019. The bills have failed to gain bipartisan support or traction in either chamber, and they have not been reintroduced in subsequent congressional sessions.

**Appropriations**  
As has been customary for many years, Congressional appropriators failed to pass yearly funding bills before the end of the fiscal year (September 30). The federal government is currently operating under a continuing resolution (CR) to keep the government funded through Dec. 20, 2024. It is expected that Congress will pass a year-end omnibus spending bill, but the outcome of the November election could alter that trajectory.

**Spent Nuclear Fuel Removal**  
Unable to make progress on removing spent nuclear fuel to interim storage facilities, congressional attention has turned to reprocessing and establishing a consent-based process for siting new facilities. The House Fiscal Year 25 Energy & Water Appropriations bill prohibits funds from being used to site a private interim storage facility, and the Senate bill authorizes the Department of Energy to identify a site for interim storage using consent-based principles. Meanwhile, the Biden Administration has made progress on establishing a consent-based siting process and issued a Request for Information seeking partners interested in developing interim storage facilities. Finally, Rep. Mike Levin (D-CA) introduced legislation to create a new government agency tasked with the disposition of used nuclear fuel, the “Nuclear Waste Administration Act.” This legislation is not expected to advance in the current Congress.

**Federal Regulatory Issues that Impacted SD-11**

**FERC Order 1000 and Order 1920**  
SMUD has participated in Order 1000 regional transmission planning through WestConnect, a regional planning entity that is comprised of member transmission providers (both jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional transmission providers) with service areas consisting of all or portions of eleven states. WestConnect members work collaboratively to jointly plan transmission facilities, assess stakeholder and market needs and develop cost-effective enhancements to the western wholesale electricity market.

In 2015, FERC accepted WestConnect’s withdrawal rights for non-jurisdictional transmission providers such as SMUD. Accordingly, if costs are allocated for particular transmission projects that are unacceptable, the non-jurisdictional transmission provider has a right to withdraw from the cost allocation determination. El Paso Electric, a WestConnect jurisdictional transmission provider, appealed FERC’s decision in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals contending that a non-jurisdictional’s decision not to accept cost allocation for a project will cause free ridership. On August 2, 2023, the 5th Circuit issued a decision reversing FERC’s WestConnect order, concluding that FERC’s order implementing Order 1000 for the WestConnect region is not a just and reasonable application of cost causation. In 2024, the WestConnect transmission providers began to discuss next steps to address the court’s decision and Order 1920 (see below) together in a FERC filing. Meanwhile, in response to the court’s decision, FERC issued an order on October 17 directing the jurisdictional transmission providers to revise their tariffs removing the opt-out provisions for non-jurisdictional transmission providers. The jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional transmission providers are discussing a response to FERC’s order and exploring alternatives for continued planning that will ensure we are able to decide whether to accept costs for transmission projects. Accordingly, there is uncertainty at this time on the future of WestConnect’s regional planning process.

In May 2024, FERC finalized its long-awaited rule known as “Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation and Generator Interconnection” (Order 1920) reforming existing regulations under Order 1000. SMUD worked with LPPC, APPA, and the Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) to develop comments in response to the proposal. FERC also hosted a technical conference with industry experts to discuss certain transmission planning and cost allocation issues, including proposals in the Notice of Proposal Rulemaking (NOPR). The final Order requires transmission providers to engage in a long-term, forward-looking planning process once every five years, developing scenarios and identifying transmission needs as well as allocating costs to the various entities within the planning region. It imposes a set of seven benefits to be considered, including aging infrastructure replacement, reduced congestion, and mitigation of extreme weather events, among other things. On cost allocation, Order 1920 requires each transmission provider to consult with state regulators on a cost allocation methodology, but it does not require state approval. SMUD had advocated for cost containment elements, and two such controls were included: reevaluation of projects in changed circumstances and right-sizing transmission rebuilds. Some entities sought rehearing of the Order at FERC and subsequently appealed the Order in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing among other things that public power entities should be given some of the same privileges as state entities in developing cost allocation methodologies. We expect FERC to issue its order on rehearing by the end of 2024 and the 4th Circuit will begin proceedings in 2025.

**CAISO Markets and Pathways Initiative**  
SMUD has a direct interest in finding long-term solutions to the challenges posed by the integration of intermittent resources, such as wind and solar. One solution has been the

GM 24-176  
Board Monitoring Report – SD-11, Public Power Business Model  
Page 17 of 18  

development of an EIM operated by the CAISO, and another solution is the CAISO’s EDAM. In general, the EIM is a sub- hourly energy platform that automatically clears and dispatches the lowest cost electricity available to serve demand on a real-time basis, with EDAM providing similar functionality but with a day-ahead resource and scheduling commitment.

SMUD joined in spring of 2019 under what is referred to as “Phase 1” of BANC’s EIM participation as the first municipal participant. SMUD has successfully participated in the EIM since go-live on April 3, 2019, which has provided reliability, operational flexibility, and financial benefits.

The rest of BANC, including the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) – Sierra Nevada Region, joined the EIM on March 25, 2021, under what is referred to as BANC EIM “Phase 2.” This broader BANC resource participation in EIM has resulted in additional economic benefits and a greater ability to integrate and manage intermittent resources within the BANC BAA.

Given the success of EIM, the CAISO, with the support of SMUD and BANC, as well as other EIM participants, launched a stakeholder initiative to develop an extension of the EIM real time framework to the CAISO’s day ahead market, referred to as the EDAM. Like EIM, EDAM would broaden the access to regional resources for the reliable integration of renewable generation and better optimization of resources, only over a longer (day ahead) time horizon, and participation is voluntary. SMUD (along with BANC) was given a seat at the table in the development of EDAM. After a few years of negotiations, along with discussions and stakeholder meetings, the CAISO Board of Governors and Western Energy Imbalance Market Governing Body initially approved the EDAM framework in February of 2023. On August 22, 2023, the CAISO filed an EDAM tariff amendment with the FERC, to which SMUD filed supportive comments. The FERC approved the EDAM proposal in December 2023, but it rejected the EDAM transmission access charge component without prejudice. The CAISO subsequently filed a revised EDAM access charge tariff amendment providing additional details and addressing the deficiencies in its original filing, which FERC approved on June 11, 2024. The CAISO began EDAM implementation activities in 2024 with EDAM launch scheduled for 2026 with PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric as the first participants. SMUD, along with the other BANC participants, plans to join EDAM beginning in Spring 2027, with SMUD/BANC implementation activities beginning in 2025. Other EIM entities have also informed the CAISO of their interest in joining EDAM in 2027, including Los Angeles Department of Water & Power (LADWP) and NV Energy. Like EIM, EDAM remains a voluntary market, allowing SMUD the added flexibility to time its participation and pivoting later, should better options arise in the future.

Some parties outside of California have stated that a day-ahead market decision, such as participation in EDAM and market services beyond EDAM, hinges on the potential for representative, independent governance. In response, multiple western state commissioners, including California, issued a letter to the Western Interstate Energy Board in summer of 2023 calling for the creation of an independent entity that could serve as a means of delivering a market for western states. The West-Wide Governance Pathways Initiative (Pathways Initiative) was created and a stakeholder committee was formed to develop a governance proposal. Following an inclusive and broad set of stakeholder meetings and comment periods throughout 2024, the committee proposed a multi-step process to create an independent governing body that would enable a path forward for a potential west-wide fully organized market (a Regional Transmission Organization, or RTO). Earlier in 2024, as the first step, the CAISO approved elevating the EIM/EDAM Governing Body joint authority with the CAISO Board to primary authority over EIM/EDAM market matters. This transition will be triggered when the following
<!-- Page 333 -->
![Board Monitoring Report – SD-11, Public Power Business Model](https://example.com/image.png)

criteria are met: i) execution of EDAM Implementation Agreements by utilities representing load equal or greater than 70% of CAISO load, and ii) at least one new participant from both the Northwest and Southwest, beyond PacifiCorp, BANC, and LADWP. The second step is the creation of a non-profit entity and transfer of governance authority over EIM/EDAM markets from the CAISO to this new “Regional Organization.” The CAISO would retain authority over its other functions such as balancing authority responsibilities, resource adequacy, transmission planning, and reliability coordination. The market governance transition would occur after FERC approval of a CAISO tariff filing. However, a condition precedent of this filing is the passage of California legislation in 2025 that would amend existing California law which currently requires the CAISO operate a market for California. And step 3 is a longer-term process that envisions future expansion of regionalized functions and services offered by the Regional Organization.

SMUD believes EDAM and the Pathways Initiative are important steps forward in the evolution of Western energy markets. EDAM enables improved intermittent resource integration by allowing participants to decommit less efficient resources in the day ahead timeframe, as opposed to only in the shorter real time window. The Pathways Initiative is aimed at solving a critical independent governance gating issue for broader participation in EDAM and other future market offerings. As we have seen with EIM’s gradual expansion that now covers 80% of the load in the west, broader and more diverse participation throughout the west unlocks more reliability, operational flexibility, and financial benefits through regional diversity. Thus, EDAM and the Pathways Initiative align well with SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan goals.

Implementing Clean Energy Tax Credits
The Department of the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service have been jointly issuing guidance to implement the clean energy tax provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. These guidance documents can have significant and material impacts on the value of the credits, particularly with respect to the elective pay provisions that allow public power systems to directly avail themselves of the credits. In 2024, Treasury and the IRS released guidance on elective pay generally as well as separate guidance on the pre-registration system established as a prerequisite to access elective pay. SMUD engaged with trade groups and coalitions to provide comments on these guidance documents as well as volunteered as a beta tester of the pre-registration portal. In addition to the elective pay guidance, Treasury and IRS are working to finalize guidance on domestic content requirements, which erode the value of elective payments if they are not met or waived. After 2025, failing to meet domestic content targets will preclude entities from accessing elective pay, making it a crucial element of the process. SMUD is awaiting final guidance on post-2025 domestic content requirements.

**Summary: 2025 Budget Resolution**  
The 2025 Proposed SMUD Budget Resolution is comprised of Operations and Maintenance budget of $1,463.9 million, Debt Service budget of $505.4 million, and Capital budget of $612 million. The proposed 2025 Budget Resolution limits spending to $2,281.3 million (total of prior amounts), plus 10% contingency, plus the commodity contingency and adjustments for Hydro Generation Adjustment transfers or revenue, Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) energy delivery shortfall, and higher retail sales. Additionally, SMUD participates in regulatory programs such as Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and Cap-and-Trade. When SMUD collects revenues through these program’s sales, it is required to apply the proceeds toward specific expenses that support the program’s goals. Should actual sales proceeds exceed the budgeted amount for these programs, the budgeted amount may be increased to match the sales proceeds without the prior specific approval of this Board. The proposed resolution also limits authorized permanent full-time positions to 2,300 plus 5 percent.  

**Public Good Charge**  
The Public Goods Charge shall be adjusted for expenditures of $104.8 million, which exceeds the minimum of 2.85% of 1994 revenues. The percentage allocation for the public goods charge expenditures shall apply to low-income assistance, energy efficiency, research and development, and new renewable generation.  

**2025 Debt Resolution**  
The 2025 Proposed Debt Resolution contains the official Declaration of Intent to Issue Debt to create $400 million of additional bonding authority to reimburse for qualifying capital expenditures.

# RESOLUTION NO. ________________

WHEREAS, the proposed 2025 Budget is expected to result in a positive net income for 2025; NOW, THEREFORE,

BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:

## Section 1.
This resolution may be referred to as the 2025 Budget Resolution.

## Section 2.
(a) There is hereby appropriated from the General Fund sufficient monies for the payment of demands against SMUD which relate to obligations incurred for the purposes and within the amount specified for such purposes in the following projection of SMUD’s program for the period January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025.

### Operations and maintenance:
- Commodity - purchased power, fuel, and wheeling: $610,000,000
- Public Goods: $67,630,890
- Customer, energy delivery, zero carbon, workforce diversity & enterprise partnerships, information technology, corporate services & Rancho Seco: $786,248,204

**Sub-Total:** $1,463,879,094

### Debt Service
- $205,393,922
- Capital and reserve: $612,031,708

**TOTAL:** $2,281,304,724

(b) The Commodity line-item budget is based on assumptions of average rainfall and temperatures during 2025. SMUD has in place a Hydro Generation Adjustment (SMUD HGA) mechanism whereby, based on the actual rainfall amounts between April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025 in comparison to the budget assumptions, SMUD may transfer funds to or from the Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund and, once pre-established limits are met, increase or decrease customer rates. The Commodity line-item budget will be increased or reduced based on the actual transfer and/or change in customer revenues from the SMUD HGA adjustment.

(c) SMUD has budgeted to receive energy in 2025 under its contract with the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). SMUD has in place a WAPA Hydro Generation Adjustment (WAPA HGA) mechanism whereby, based on the actual delivery from WAPA between April 1, 2024, and March 31, 2025 in comparison to the budget assumptions, SMUD may transfer funds to or from the WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund and, once pre-established limits are met, increase or decrease customer rates. This energy primarily is generated at Central Valley Project hydroelectric plants, and the actual quantity of energy received will be dependent on rainfall, carryover water storage and operation of the WAPA system to meet contractual water deliveries. Because WAPA generation facilities are spread over a wide area, insurance is not practical for offsetting variations of energy deliveries due to weather. One purpose of the Rate Stabilization Fund is to mitigate such variations.
<!-- Page 340 -->
![Draft Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Draft+Document)

Commodity line-item budget will be increased or reduced based on the actual transfer and/or change in customer revenues from the WAPA HGA adjustment

(d) Budgeted energy purchases necessary to meet customer energy sales requirements (10,500 GWh) are based on average weather conditions and expected customer growth in 2025. Should actual weather conditions or growth levels cause SMUD retail sales and related energy requirements to be higher, the Commodity line item budget will be increased by the NP15 power price per megawatt-hour of additional retail energy sales to offset the cost of these sales.

(e) SMUD participates in regulatory programs such as Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and Cap-and-Trade. Under these programs, SMUD has the option to monetize the credits and allowances applicable to these programs through sales transactions. When SMUD collects revenues through these sales, it is required to apply the proceeds toward specific expenses that support the program goals. An additional purpose of the Rate Stabilization Fund is to mitigate fluctuations from regulatory programs. The Accountant is hereby authorized to transfer funds to or from the Rate Stabilization Fund to match LCFS and Cap-and-Trade revenues with expenses. The budgeted amount will be increased or decreased accordingly.

(f) For purposes of Section 11891.6 of the Municipal Utility District Act, there shall be deemed added to each line item, in section 2a, a 10 percent contingency. Demands against SMUD which relate to obligations incurred for each line item and are within such line item amount plus the 10
<!-- Page 341 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=DRAFT)

percent contingency may be paid without prior specific approval of this Board, provided the total of such payments during 2025 may not exceed the total budget amount plus this 10% contingency, plus the commodity contingency and adjustments for weather hedge contracts, higher retail sales and Rate Stabilization transfers as set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) above.

**Section 3.** Demands against SMUD may be paid without the prior specific approval of this Board if they relate to obligations incurred for the purpose and within the amounts specified in Section 2, provided such demands are approved by the CEO & General Manager or someone to whom he has delegated such approval authority. It is the purpose and intent of this paragraph to delegate to the CEO & General Manager authority to make purchases, to negotiate and execute contracts, and expend funds in any manner necessary or appropriate to the administration of the business affairs of SMUD, all within the amounts and for the purposes set forth above, and subject to the provisions of existing law and of all the duly passed resolutions of this Board, including the Board-approved delegations of authority.

**Section 4.** At monthly intervals, the Treasurer shall transfer from the General Fund appropriate amounts into each of the various funds established to service SMUD's general obligation indebtedness, its Electric System Revenue Bond indebtedness, and its Electric Revenue Bond indebtedness in approximately equal installments as set forth in the tabulations on file with the Accountant. Investment authority, for all funds, is delegated to the Treasurer for a one-year period in accordance with California Code Section 53607.
<!-- Page 342 -->
![Draft Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Draft+Document)

**Section 5.** The number of permanent full-time employees during 2025 shall not exceed 2,300 employees plus a five percent contingency without further authorization of this Board.

**Section 6.** The Public Goods Charge shall be adjusted for expenditures of $104.8 million, which exceeds the minimum of 2.85% of 1994 revenues. The percentage allocation for the public goods charge expenditures shall apply to low-income assistance, energy efficiency, research and development, and new renewable generation.

**Section 7.** The CEO & General Manager, or his designee, is authorized to make future changes to the Budget that, in his prudent judgment: (a) further the primary purpose of the Budget; (b) are intended to provide a net benefit to SMUD; and (c) do not exceed the authorized Budget amounts and applicable contingencies.

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of SMUD desires to inform its customers and the public of its plans for financing capital improvements and other capital expenditures to its system by specifying certain items for which the proceeds of said revenue bonds are to be used, which uses shall not include daily maintenance and operations costs; NOW, THEREFORE,

BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:

**Section 1.** The Board of Directors of SMUD declares its intention to authorize the issuance of additional revenue bonds or Clean Renewable Energy Bonds for the purpose of financing, in whole or in part, the costs of the capital items identified in SMUD’s 2025 capital budget, 2023 and 2024 capital expenditures not previously financed, the prepayment of purchased power or natural gas and the purchase of natural gas reserves, pipelines or storage facilities, for all of which SMUD is authorized by law to issue such bonds. SMUD has paid or reasonably expects to pay certain expenditures (the “Reimbursement Expenditures”) in connection with such capital items prior to the issuance of such bonds, and hereby officially declares its intent to use certain proceeds of such bonds to reimburse the Reimbursement Expenditures. The declarations contained in this section are made solely for purposes of establishing compliance with Section 1.150-2 of the U. S. Treasury Regulations, and do not bind SMUD to make any expenditure, incur any indebtedness or proceed with the abovementioned capital expenditures.

**Section 2.** The maximum principal amount of the additional revenue bonds proposed to be issued under this supplemental resolution is
<!-- Page 349 -->
![DRAFT](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=DRAFT)

$400,000,000. Such maximum principal amount is in addition to the  
$9,055,000,000 principal amount of revenue bonds authorized pursuant to the  
Prior Resolutions. Such additional bonds may be issued in series from time to  
time, and it shall not be necessary that all of the bonds proposed to be issued be  
issued at any one time.  

Proceeds from the issuance of these bonds will be used to finance  
capital improvements identified in SMUD's 2025 capital budget, 2023 and 2024  
capital expenditures not previously financed, capital expenditures for the  
prepayment of purchased power or natural gas and the purchase of natural gas  
reserves, pipelines, or storage facilities. The declarations in this section are  
made solely to establish compliance with Section 12852 of the California Public  
Utilities Code, and do not bind SMUD to make any expenditure, incur any  
indebtedness or proceed with the above-mentioned capital expenditures.  

**Section 3.** The maximum term of any of such bonds is 40 years.  
In the event the maximum authorized amount under a series of bonds is divided  
into two or more series, the said maximum term shall be calculated in each case  
from the date of each divided series of bonds.  

**Section 4.** The maximum rate of interest to be payable upon  
such bonds shall not exceed the interest rate per annum equal to the greater of  
fifteen percent (15 percent) per annum or the yield of United States Treasury  
bonds having a remaining term equal, as nearly as practicable, to the final  
maturity of such bonds, as determined by SMUD as of the date of sale of such

bonds, plus three percent (3 percent). The maximum discount with respect to such bonds shall not exceed ten percent (10 percent).

**Section 5.** This resolution shall take effect immediately, subject only to the right of referendum provided in Article 6a of Chapter 6 of Division 6 of the California Public Utilities Code (beginning at Section 12850 thereof).

**Section 6.** The Secretary of SMUD is hereby directed to publish a copy of this resolution once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published within SMUD’s boundaries. At any time within 60 days after the date of the second such publication, a referendum petition signed by voters in number equal to at least three percent (3 percent) of the total vote cast, as defined in Section 11507 of the California Public Utilities Code, demanding the submission of this resolution to a vote of the voters of SMUD for their assent to the issuance of the proposed bonds, may be filed with the Secretary of SMUD. Upon presentation to the Secretary of SMUD of such a referendary petition, this resolution shall not be of effect unless and until it has been assented to by the voters.
