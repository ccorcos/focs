# SMUD – ROSEVILLE TEMPORARY CVP WATER TRANSFER REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT

THIS REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENT (“Agreement”) is made and entered into this ___ day of ______________, 20__, by and between the City of Roseville, a municipal corporation ("CITY"), and Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a municipal utility district ("SMUD").

## W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, CITY is interested in acquiring a portion of additional Central Valley Water Project (“CVP”) water supply, by permanent contract assignment, from SMUD; and

WHEREAS, the reassigned project water would be stored in the aquifers under CITY using CITY’s Aquifer Storage and Recovery (“ASR”) equipped groundwater wells; and

WHEREAS, CITY has a current need to prove out the “real world” injection capacity of CITY’s existing ASR wells and the data to be gathered would help justify to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (“Reclamation”) the capacity of the ASR system to potentially acquire a permanent contract assignment of a portion of SMUD’s CVP water service contract entitlement at some future date under separate agreement; and

WHEREAS, SMUD and CITY agree that a temporary CVP water transfer of up to two thousand (2,000) acre-feet per year over a three (3) year period beginning from December 1, 2023 through February 28, 2026 is an appropriate means of providing the needed ASR data to continue reassignment discussions with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, SMUD and CITY; and

WHEREAS, any water used as part of the proposed CVP transfer would be used for purposes of the limited testing of the City’s ASR groundwater and injection well capacity and for developing ASR groundwater system readiness.
<!-- Page 49 -->
NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

1. **Purchase of Water by CITY.** SMUD agrees to transfer up to two thousand (2,000) acre-feet of project water per year to CITY from SMUD’s CVP contract entitlement over an established three (3) year period of December 1, 2023 through February 28, 2026 with such amounts of water not exceeding the annual Not-To-Exceed Reimbursement Amounts established herein as EXHIBIT A. CITY acknowledges and understands the completion of a transfer in any given year is dependent upon Reclamation’s determination of whether the water is available and whether Reclamation approves the transfer. SMUD makes no representation or warranty as to the successful completion of one or any of the proposed transfers.

2. **Costs and Reimbursements.** In exchange for the transfer of available and CVP approved water during the established three (3) year period, CITY will compensate SMUD at the rate of $250 per acre-foot of water actually received by CITY from SMUD’s CVP contract entitlement. CITY shall also bear all costs of reimbursing Reclamation for associated staff work on the transfer, as well as the hiring of necessary consultant(s) for environmental documentation needed for each transfer. Any consultant(s) reasonably hired by SMUD to facilitate the completion of any transfer must be preapproved by the CITY in writing before any such related costs are incurred for reimbursement by CITY, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

If CITY disputes any costs claimed by SMUD for a reasonable cause, the amounts and reasons for the disputed item(s) will be documented in writing to SMUD within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice. CITY has the right to request additional documentation, and/or audit of the costs presented by SMUD. SMUD shall provide all documents reasonably requested by CITY. All undisputed costs will be reimbursed by CITY within 60 days.
<!-- Page 50 -->

# Board Monitoring Report 2023
## SD-11, Public Power Business Model

### 1. Background
Strategic Direction 11, Public Power Business Model states that:

Supporting and strengthening the public power business model is a core value. Local decision making and flexibility are essential to effective and responsible local governance. Community-owned utilities are primarily accountable to their customers, not stockholders. Community citizens have a direct voice in public power decisions.

Preservation of this business model is vital to ensure public power systems continue to provide innovative solutions tailored to best meet the needs of their customers and communities.

### 2. Executive Summary
SMUD is in compliance with SD-11.

The SD-11 monitoring report updates the Board on our efforts to insulate SMUD from issues that may impact our local governance and provide the Board with a final status report on 2023 issues impacting this strategic directive. SMUD’s interests are advanced in the legislative and regulatory arenas to the greatest extent possible. For instance, SMUD meets with key federal and state officials, both elected and appointed, with the driving purpose of educating them on the impact of new and existing policy.

**State Legislative.** SMUD had several victories this year in the California Legislature that advanced the public power business model to ensure local decision making and flexibility. SMUD defended against legislation that would have forced publicly-owned utilities (POUs) to allow attachments to utility poles without appropriate safeguards in place if a short shot-clock approval timeline was not met [Assembly Bill (AB) 965] and secured amendments to remove POUs not within the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) from a planning reserve margin fee assessed by the California Energy Commission (AB 1373). SMUD also worked through our trade associations to remove special districts from a bill that would have required us to change our website and email domains to .ca.gov or .gov (AB 1637). Further, SMUD helped advance legislation to protect rate-making authority [Assembly Constitutional Amendment (ACA) 13] and allow remote Board meetings during emergencies (AB 557). SMUD also worked through a broad coalition to secure funding for electric vehicle infrastructure through the Clean Transportation Program (AB 126).

**State Regulatory.** SMUD engaged in numerous proceedings before state agencies this year, chiefly the California Energy Commission (CEC) and California Air Resources Board (CARB), to advance the public power business model. Most notably, SMUD and our associations successfully influenced the development of the CARB's Advanced Clean Fleets regulation, which requires public agencies and large commercial fleets to transition all medium- and heavy-duty (MHD) vehicles to zero-emission beginning in 2024, to add compliance flexibility measures while supporting the trajectory to electrify MHD vehicle fleets. Key changes in the final rule included securing a fleet averaging compliance option for public fleets as an alternative to purchase mandates and expanding the conditions for seeking an exemption.

SMUD’s strategic directives, protect jurisdictional limits, and monitor potential changes to industry standards. These include, but are not limited to:
- CARB’s Cap-and-Trade pre-rulemaking proceeding (ongoing) where SMUD continues to advocate to preserve allowance allocations for POUs and flexibility regarding allowance disposition.
- CARB’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) pre-rulemaking proceeding (ongoing), where through our associations, SMUD is advocating for increased program stringency to promote additional transportation emissions reductions and support credit prices and changes to utility spending requirements to increase flexibility and adaptability.
- CEC’s Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) and Distributed Electricity Backup Assets (DEBA) program implementation, where SMUD and the California Municipal Utilities Association (CMUA) influenced program guidelines to provide greater flexibility for POU-administered programs and dedicated funding for projects in POU service areas.
- CEC’s Power Source Disclosure (PSD) pre-rulemaking proceeding (currently ongoing), where SMUD and our associations are advocating to ensure that implementation of hourly greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting requirements and other changes to the PSD program are accurate and within the statutory authority.
- California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) investigation into a new statewide database of utility poles and conduits (ongoing), where through our associations, SMUD advocated against assertion of jurisdiction over POUs.
- Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety (OEIS) development of potential recommendations to the CPUC regarding wildfire-related General Orders (ongoing), which could impact the industry standards SMUD follows.

Finally, SMUD worked closely with agency staff on the successful approval of SMUD’s Neighborhood SolarShares program as a community solar program under the CEC’s 2022 Energy Code, and SMUD’s application to use LCFS credit proceeds to fund workforce development programs in accordance with LCFS equity spending requirements. SMUD also continued coordination with the CEC regarding SMUD’s compliance approach for the newly adopted Load Management Standards regulations, which took effect in April 2023.

Federal. SMUD has secured a $50 million grant from the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership (GRIP) Program which will help fund our Connected PowerCity Project. This $156 million project will develop the next generation of smart grid infrastructure here in Sacramento showcasing public power’s ingenuity by deploying a technology ecosystem enabling interactive energy management relationships between SMUD and our customers.

On the legislative front, SMUD has been active in the appropriations process, which determines the level of funding available for high-priority grant programs authorized in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), as well as defended against proposals to reverse the direct pay provisions enacted in the IRA. SMUD submitted earlier this year a Congressionally Directed project, or earmark request, to offices for Senators Feinstein and Padilla for a battery storage fire safety training initiative which was not selected to proceed among the Senators’ appropriation submissions. However, SMUD was awarded an earmark of $3 million dollars for a total project cost of $6 million dollars. Using this funding, SMUD plans to electrify 300 homes in the Meadowview neighborhood. This request was made and awarded through Representative Matsui’s office.

Defensive positions included advocating against legislation that would rescind energy tax credits and the ability to elect direct payment of tax credits in House legislation to raise the debt limit. In a legislative

**Page 3 of 18**

In the regulatory arena, SMUD worked with numerous coalitions on comments responding to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to curb greenhouse gases from new and existing fossil-fueled power plants. SMUD also continued engagement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on dockets related to cost allocation and transmission planning. SMUD continues to develop its enterprise-wide grant capture program to respond to federal funding opportunity announcements and build relationships with key officials and new offices within the DOE in charge of IIJA grant guidance and implementation efforts.

**Community Choice Aggregators (CCA).** AB 117 (2002) created Community Choice Aggregation and authorized local governments to aggregate customer electric load and become the default power provider in the service territory of an incumbent investor-owned utility (IOU). SMUD responded by offering to provide operational services to CCAs.

Today, SMUD offers the following services: contact center services, billing services, data management services, analytics services, program design and administration services, marketing services, and market research, and debt collection services. Current clients include: Valley Clean Energy (VCE), Ava Community Energy (formerly known as East Bay Community Energy), Silicon Valley Clean Energy (SVCE), Marin Clean Energy (MCE), and Sonoma Clean Power (SCP). CCAs enable their customers to access many of the same public power benefits that SMUD and other POUs have provided millions of Californians. Our support of CCAs promotes public power. CCAs also have aggressive carbon reduction goals similar to SMUD’s. Our support of CCAs promotes carbon reduction regionally. SMUD is leveraging our decades of experience as a utility, staff expertise, and existing systems to provide skilled services to CCAs, generating new revenue and strengthening SMUD’s ability to provide cost effective public power service to our customers.

There are currently over 24 active CCAs in California, representing nearly half of the state, and additional ones emerging or investigating the feasibility of starting a new CCA. The potential for new CCA clients for SMUD is great.

**Western Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) and Extended Day-Ahead Market (EDAM)**  
SMUD continues to see significant benefits with its participation in the CAISO’s EIM since joining in 2019 through the Balancing Authority of Northern California (BANC). On March 25, 2021, the remaining BANC Balancing Authority Area (BAA) footprint joined the EIM. This broader BANC resource participation has resulted in greater economic benefits and a better ability to integrate and manage intermittent resources within the BANC footprint.

SMUD and BANC, as well as other EIM participants, have supported the extension of the EIM real-time framework to the CAISO’s day ahead market under the CAISO’s EDAM initiative. After a few years of discussions, direct involvement with the CAISO and a handful of other stakeholders, and broader stakeholder meetings to develop an EDAM proposal, the CAISO filed a tariff amendment with FERC in August 2023. Pending FERC’s approval of the filing, to which SMUD also filed supportive comments, EDAM implementation activities are planned for 2024 with EDAM launch as early as 2025. SMUD plans to participate in EDAM beginning in the 2026 timeframe, depending on its implementation efforts and coordination with other BANC participants. SMUD views EDAM as an important step forward in the evolution of Western energy markets and it aligns well with SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan goals.

As SMUD’s Strategic Plan indicates, internal and external factors are driving our business and shaping our business model. Legislative and regulatory uncertainty continues to be a threat to the Public Power Business Model (SD-11). SMUD takes positions on legislation and regulations based on the Board’s Strategic Direction.
<!-- Page 62 -->
# 3. Additional Supporting Information

Local decision making and flexibility are essential to effective and responsible local governance. We continued to guard local decision-making and flexibility as we pursue innovative solutions that meet the needs of our customers and our community. High priority 2023 issues were as follows:

- Meetings with state legislators to highlight SMUD’s legislative priorities to advance the public power business model.
- Securing amendments to remove applicability on onerous requirements to SMUD (e.g., AB 965, AB 1637, AB 1373).
- Advocating for the passage of ACA 13 to protect local governments’ fee and rate authority.
- Supporting AB 557, which eliminates the sunset date on provisions of law allowing local agencies to use teleconferencing without complying with specified Brown Act requirements during a state of emergency.
- Working with coalition of electric vehicle (EV) advocates to secure reauthorization of Clean Transportation Program funding (AB 126).
- Grants capture initiatives to support SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan, including the GRIP II grant, the Recompete grant, and Matsui earmark.
- Advocating for favorable outcomes in the appropriations process, which determines the level of funding available for high-priority grant programs authorized in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
- Defending against proposals to reverse the direct pay provisions enacted in the IRA.
- Meetings with CEC Commissioners to educate key policy decision-makers on activities and needs related to SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan, including transportation electrification, building electrification, and local flexibility, to advance the public power business model.
- Securing changes to the Advanced Clean Fleets regulation to increase compliance options for public agencies and improve the transparency and scope of the exemption process.
- Advocating to preserve POU allowance allocations and flexibility regarding allowance value within the Cap-and-Trade program.
- Continued outreach to the CEC regarding SMUD’s compliance approach to the Load Management Standards regulation, as well as the development of SMUD’s compliance plan.
- Advocating at the CEC for funds from, and flexible program guidelines to implement, the Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) and Distributed Energy Backup Assets Program (DEBA) Programs to support grid investment.
- Working with the California Electric Transportation Coalition (CalETC) and partners to encourage changes to strengthen the LCFS program and update utility spending requirements.
- Securing approval of SMUD’s application to serve as community solar administrator of Neighborhood SolarShares under the 2022 Energy Code.
- Securing approval of SMUD’s application to use LCFS equity proceeds for workforce development programs.
- Working with trade associations to monitor and respond to proposals that could impact jurisdictional authority (e.g., pole attachments proceeding).
- Periodic meetings with CARB staff to advocate for consideration of electricity reliability and affordability in the development of programs, policies, and regulations impacting the electricity sector.

# 4. Challenges:

SMUD continues to face prescriptive legislative and regulatory mandates for carbon reduction, renewable energy, resources planning, and building and vehicle electrification, in part because

GM 23-208  
Board Monitoring Report – SD-11, Public Power Business Model

<!-- Page 63 -->
![Board Monitoring Report – SD-11, Public Power Business Model](https://example.com/image.png)

of the State’s robust climate change goals and their potential interplay with pending federal regulations. With SMUD customers still struggling as energy costs continue to rise, it is particularly important to defend against mandates that increase costs for SMUD. At the state level, an increased interest by legislators and the Governor in both reliability and climate change led to legislative action in the form of planning reserve margin requirements and the creation of a central procurement entity (optional for POUs).

While state policy is increasingly recognizing the important of a diverse set of resources to reliably and affordably achieve electric sector decarbonization goals, uncertainty remains regarding the definition of “zero-carbon resources,” particularly emerging technologies, for purposes of the state’s long-term goals. This uncertainty and potential lag in updating state policy and regulations may pose some challenges for SMUD, as a POU that is making early investments in emerging technologies to support decarbonization goals that are faster than those of the state. For example, next year the CEC and CARB will also be preparing reports that consider and evaluate the potential role of resources like hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration, and long duration storage, in contributing to the state’s goals. The CEC will also be leading the development of the next SB 100 Joint Agency Report, which will evaluate the tradeoffs of various scenarios – including one with no combustion of biogas, carbon capture, or hydrogen – to inform state policymakers. SMUD will continue to advocate for policies that recognize the renewable and zero-carbon resources needed to decarbonize our grid.

Changes to Cap-and-Trade are on the horizon, and CARB staff has signaled both a need to reduce allowance allocations and interest in more prescriptive requirements for the disposition of allowance value. In addition, the CEC is preparing for a rulemaking to implement hourly GHG emissions accounting and reporting requirements for SMUD and other large utilities as part of the Power Source Disclosure program. The new requirements will be highly complex, and it will be critical to ensure that implementation is accurate, understandable, and fair.

SMUD will continue to advocate for the advancement of beneficial transportation and building electrification, along with consideration of utility needs for accelerating the enabling infrastructure. Transportation electrification has been a priority for this Administration, with Governor Newsom’s executive order to require that all new cars and passenger trucks sold in California be zero-emission vehicles by 2035 and CARB’s Advanced Clean Cars II regulation that took effect at the end of 2022. Moreover, with the Advanced Clean Fleets regulation taking effect in January 2024, the CEC, CARB, and CPUC are all focusing on efforts to deploy the necessary infrastructure to support zero-emission vehicles and freight, which may include recommendations for mandates. Changes to the LCFS are also on the horizon; while many of the current proposals are expected to be positive, SMUD and our associations are also monitoring for potential changes regarding the recipients of base credits and the impacts of CARB’s proposal to phase out avoided methane crediting for dairy digesters.

5. Recommendation

It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-11.

# Appendices

## State Legislation that Impacted SD-11

### ACA 13 (Ward) Voting Thresholds
ACA 13, a proposed constitutional amendment, requires any constitutional amendments proposed by initiative that call for an increase in the threshold vote requirement be approved by the same proportion of votes cast as the measure would require for future local measures.

**SMUD Position:** Support. SMUD’s advocacy, including Board involvement, proved vital in getting this legislation over the finish line.  
**Status:** This legislation passed through the legislature and does not need action by the Governor. It will be on the November 2024 ballot and must be approved by a majority of California voters.

**Staff Comment:** This proposed constitutional amendment is in response to the California Business Roundtable (CBRT) initiative, which would jeopardize local government revenues and hinder local governments’ ability to deliver essential services. Under current law, it would take only a simple majority vote to pass the CBRT measure, but, with ACA 13, it would need to be approved by a two-thirds vote.

### AB 965 (Carrillo) Broadband Permit Applications
This bill would have required POUs (in addition to cities and counties) to undertake batch broadband permit processing upon receiving two or more “substantially similar” broadband permit applications submitted at the same time, within a reasonable time. If the POU did not approve or reject those batch permits in a reasonable time, the permits would be deemed approved.

**SMUD Position:** Oppose unless amended. Once amendments were taken to remove POUs from the bill's requirements, SMUD moved to a neutral position.  
**Status:** Signed by the Governor without provisions that impact SMUD.

**Staff Comment:** There would have been significant safety concerns with this bill, particularly in deeming pole attachments approved if we do not meet the review shot clock. SMUD opposed the bill with a very strong letter and effective advocacy, including in meetings with the Board and our legislative delegation, resulting in the removal of POUs from the bill. The bill passed and was signed by the Governor, setting forth requirements for cities and counties.

### AB 1373 (Garcia) Energy
This urgency bill that required a two-thirds vote, became law as soon as the Governor signed it on October 7. At a high level, the bill requires the CEC to produce a report by January 31, 2024, assessing every POU’s planning reserve margin (PRM) and whether each POU met it. The report will also look at how POU PRMs stack up against the CPUC standards for 2023. The CEC Executive Director is required to assess a capacity payment on POUs that serve load in the CAISO which are found to be short on their PRM in any month when the Strategic Reliability Reserve is used to maintain grid reliability. The bill also provides a mechanism for the Department of Water Resources to centrally procure various electric generating and storage resources. Costs will be borne by customers of load-serving entities. POUs can voluntarily participate in a centrally procured resources.

**SMUD Position:** Neutral once priority amendments were included in bill. Previously held an oppose unless amendment position.  
**Status:** Signed by Governor. Became law on October 7 as an urgency measure.

**Staff Comment:** SMUD staff advocated heavily on this bill. The idea initially came about through the Governor's proposed budget and morphed into a policy bill. We had an oppose unless amended position on the bill. The amendments we sought were to remove non-CAISO POUs from the PRM requirements and to get some clarification on the central procurement entity. With the narrowing of the central procurement entity and the removal of non-CAISO POUs from the PRM, we became neutral on the bill.

### AB 1637 (Irwin) Internet Websites and Email Addresses
This bill requires local agencies to adopt a .ca.gov or .gov domain name. This would have included special districts, as well as cities and counties, but we successfully advocated to get special districts removed from the bill.

**SMUD Position:** Worked through CMUA and the California Special Districts Association (CSDA) to express our concerns.  
**Status:** Signed by Governor

**Staff Comment:** The impact would have been widespread, costly, and potentially have impacts to our cyber security efforts. We successfully advocated to get special districts removed from the bill, but we anticipate a similar effort to resurface next year.

### AB 557 (Hart) Local Agencies: Teleconferences
This bill removes the January 1, 2024 sunset in current law for local agency governing bodies to hold remote, instead of in-person, meetings during states of emergencies. It also extends the period that a local agency body must make findings of a continuing emergency from every 30 days to every 45 days.

**SMUD Position:** Support  
**Status:** Signed by Governor

**Staff Comment:** CSDA sponsored the bill, and SMUD supported it.

### SB 57 (Gonzalez) Disconnection of Residential Service
This bill would have required an electrical corporation, local publicly owned electric utility, gas corporation, local publicly owned gas utility, water corporation, or local agency that owns a public water system to postpone the disconnection of a customer’s residential service for nonpayment of a delinquent account when the temperature will be 32 degrees Fahrenheit or cooler, or 95 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer, within the utility’s service area during the 24 hours after that service disconnection would occur.

**SMUD Position:** None  
**Status:** Two-Year Bill

**Staff Comment:** The bill died before it had a hearing, but we, along with other CMUA members, expressed concern immediately. This could have significant financial impacts and presents jurisdictional concerns.

### AB 735 (Berman) Workforce Development: Utility Careers
This bill establishes the High Road Utility Careers program to connect existing resources with individuals interested in careers in the utility sector.

**SMUD Position:** Support  
**Status:** Two-Year Bill  

**Staff Comment:** The bill is sponsored by CMUA, and SMUD is supporting the bill. It unfortunately didn’t pass this year, but we will continue to support it if moves forward next year.

---

**AB 538 (Holden) Multistate Regional Transmission System Organization: Membership**  
This bill authorizes the CAISO to submit a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO) governance plan to the CEC. This would essentially be the first step to allow for a west-wide RTO. The bill included language to make a POU’s participation optional.

**SMUD Position:** SMUD does not have a position on the bill, but we engaged in conversations and watched it closely. CMUA had an oppose unless amended position.  
**Status:** Two-Year Bill  

**Staff Comment:** Relatedly, on July 14, regulators from California, Oregon, and Washington state sent a letter to the Committee on Regional Electric Power Cooperation (CREPC), which is part of the Western Interstate Energy Board. CREPC is comprised of Western energy commissioners and state energy office officials and focuses on regional cooperation issues. On behalf of California, CPUC President Alice Reynolds and CEC Vice Chair Siva Gunda signed the letter, which basically would create a separate 501(c) entity for the purposes of forming a West-wide market, and the CAISO would staff the entity. The signatories of the letter — Oregon, Washington, California, Arizona, and New Mexico — plan to work through an initial development phase this year, and they would decide key elements of the new entity’s structure. Implementation is targeted for 2024.

**AB 9 (Muratsuchi) Greenhouse Gases: Market-Based Compliance Mechanism**  
This bill would have required CARB to initiate a regulatory process to evaluate potential updates to Cap-and-Trade. It also would have required the evaluation to focus on specified items, including whether the supply of emission allowances and carbon offsets are consistent with statewide greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals.

**SMUD Position:** No official position.  
**Status:** Two-Year Bill  

**Staff Comment:** Given that potential changes to the Cap-and-Trade program could impact rates, we will continue to watch this bill closely, should it move next year.

---

**SB 308 (Becker) Carbon Dioxide Removal Market Development Act**  
This bill would have required CARB, no later than 2027, to adopt a regulation to require emitting entities who produce 25,000 metric tons or more a year to purchase negative emissions credits equal to a specified amount of their greenhouse gas emissions.

**SMUD Position:** None  
**Status:** Two-Year Bill  

---

**AB 126 (Reyes) Clean Transportation Program Fee Extension**  
The bill reflects a three-party compromise to continue funding the Clean Transportation Program (CTP), the Air Quality Improvement Program (AQIP) and the Enhanced Fleet Modernization Program (EFMP) in California until 2035. These are all critical programs to advance zero emission vehicles and related.

**Infrastructure.** Specifically, AB 126 extends the fees originally established in 2007 to 2035 at the same levels to maintain reliable funding (over a billion dollars has been provided over the last 15 years) to support the state’s transition to zero-emission vehicles and reduce vehicle pollution. In order to reach this compromise, amendments were taken on September 11, 2023, that include a 15% carve out in the CTP for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty hydrogen infrastructure until 2030 as well as the addition of new reporting requirements for zero-emission vehicle charging and refueling infrastructure.

**SMUD Position:** Support  
**Status:** Signed by Governor  
**Staff Comment:** SMUD was active in our support of this bill and worked closely with the CalETC and other low carbon vehicle advocates.

**AB 1594 (Garcia) Medium- and Heavy-Duty Zero-Emission Vehicles: Public Agency Utilities**  
The bill is intended to rectify issues in the CARB Advanced Clean Fleets (ACF) rule. Specifically, the bill requires a state agency to ensure rules applicable to vehicle fleet purchases allow public agency utilities to replace vehicles without regard to model year and to determine the daily usage of a utility vehicle that does not exclusively rely on the lowest mileage reading and does not exclude the highest usage days. The legislation allows CARB, in consultation with public agency utilities, to determine the end of useful life of an applicable vehicle.

**SMUD Position:** Watch; worked with CMUA on amendments  
**Status:** Signed by Governor

---

**State Regulation that Impacted SD-11**

**Advanced Clean Fleets (ACF) Regulation**  
In April 2023, CARB unanimously adopted the ACF regulation, which requires public agencies, drayage truck operators, and larger companies to transition their medium- and heavy-duty (MHD) vehicle fleets to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). The rule also increases the ZEV sales requirement for truck manufacturers to 100% of vehicle sales by the 2036 model year. The ACF regulation is part of a comprehensive strategy to achieve a zero-emission truck and bus fleet by 2045 everywhere feasible, and significantly earlier for market segments such as public fleets.

The final ACF regulation provides two compliance pathways for public agencies like SMUD:  
- **Annual ZEV purchase requirements,** which require half of all MHD vehicle purchases to be zero-emission starting in 2024 and 100% to be zero-emission starting in 2027, or  
- A “ZEV milestones” option that is based on fleet averaging and requires an increasing percentage of the fleet to be zero-emission at each milestone date. The first milestone date is in 2025.

The ZEV milestone option was originally available only to commercially owned fleets; SMUD successfully advocated to expand its availability to public agencies, which may opt in until January 1, 2030. Along with CMUA, CalETC, and utility stakeholders, SMUD also advocated for the final regulation to include robust, transparent frameworks for determining when ZEVs are commercially available and have been demonstrated to be reliable for specialized use cases, as well as for assessing other exceptions to the ZEV requirements.
<!-- Page 68 -->
![Board Monitoring Report – SD-11, Public Power Business Model](https://example.com/image.png)

As a result of stakeholder advocacy, the final regulation expanded on the reasons for which fleet owners make seek exemptions, upon demonstration of specific requirements, if ZEVs are unavailable for purchase, cannot meet certain mileage or energy usage requirements, are needed for mutual aid and cannot be refueled using mobile charging. The regulation also includes extensions if vehicle deliveries are delayed or if a fleet owner experiences delays beyond its control in the construction or utility energization of ZEV charging infrastructure. However, there are limitations in the use of each extension or exemption, so relief may be challenging to secure in practice.

**Status:** The ACF regulation was approved by the Office of Administrative Law in September 2023 and will take effect October 1, 2024. Regulatory requirements for fleet owners begin January 1, 2024. CARB is convening a Truck Regulation Advisory Committee (TRAC) working groups to focus on ACF implementation, including ZEV infrastructure needs and the application of certain exemption requirements.

### Cap-and-Trade Amendments (Pre-Rulemaking)
The Cap-and-Trade program is a key element of California’s strategy to reduce GHG emissions by setting an economy-wide, declining cap on annual GHG emissions. Covered entities must surrender compliance instruments, or allowances, for each metric ton of GHG emissions. The current regulation provides SMUD, and other electric utilities, a specified amount of directly allocated allowances through 2030 to mitigate the cost impacts to ratepayers of compliance with the Cap-and-Trade program. As a POU, SMUD has the option of depositing allowances to meet our compliance obligations or consigning allowances to auction and using the proceeds to benefit ratepayers, in accordance with certain regulatory requirements.

This summer, CARB initiated pre-rulemaking activities for potential updates to the Cap-and-Trade regulation. The primary objective of the update is to align the Cap-and-Trade program with CARB’s 2022 Scoping Plan Update, which calls for additional emissions reductions by 2030 in order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. As part of the update, CARB will also consider changes to improve program implementation. While CARB has not yet proposed any formal amendments, potential changes under consideration that are key to SMUD include:
- Reductions to allowance budgets, including utility allowance allocations, through 2030.
- Reduced flexibility for POUs to either consign allowances to auction or deposit for compliance.
- Reduced flexibility for POUs regarding use of allowance proceeds.

POU allowance allocations provide important ratepayer benefits and are critical to advancing the state’s GHG reduction goals. Reductions in allowance allocations may directly impact ratepayers during a time when the state is suffering from an affordability crisis. SMUD and our associations have urged CARB to minimize changes to utility allowance allocations to the extent possible. SMUD also does not support changes that would require POUs to consign all allowances and restrict proceeds; preserving POUs’ flexibility to determine how best to use allowance value is the most efficient, effective, and suitable way to respond to local communities’ needs and reduce GHG emissions in our service areas.

**Status:** CARB has held several pre-rulemaking workshops but has not yet released draft regulatory amendments. The formal rulemaking is expected to begin late 2023 or early 2024, with a target effective date of January 1, 2025.

![Power Source Disclosure Amendments (Pre-Rulemaking)](https://example.com/image.png)

**Power Source Disclosure Amendments (Pre-Rulemaking)**  
Last year, SB 1158 (Becker) established new hourly GHG reporting requirements for retail suppliers of electricity, including SMUD, which the CEC is tasked with implementing. Under the new law, retail suppliers will be required to report the following information beginning January 1, 2028:
- Sources of electricity used to serve hourly loss-adjusted retail load.
- The GHG emissions associated with each source.
- Annual total and average GHG emissions intensity.
- Annual avoided GHG emissions.

Implementation of the new hourly reporting requirements will be proposed in conjunction with changes to the existing Power Source Disclosure program and annual reporting and disclosure requirements. In late summer 2023, CEC staff released proposals and draft regulatory amendments. Under these proposals, retail suppliers would be attributed the emissions associated with all owned and contracted generation during a given hour, even if that generation was sold into the market and did not serve loss-adjusted retail load. The staff proposal also would expand the annual Power Content Label to address non-retail loads, among other changes.

The CEC staff proposals could result in misattribution or double accounting of greenhouse gas emissions as well as create perverse incentives for retail suppliers to rely on market purchases instead of their own procured resources. Moreover, addressing non-retail loads on the Power Content Label is likely to confuse customers and is inconsistent with the statutory requirements. SMUD and CMUA are advocating for changes to the proposals and additional discussion prior to the CEC finalizing the implementation approach.

**Status:** CEC is reviewing comments on the staff proposal and considering changes. The formal rulemaking process is expected to begin in late 2023 or early 2024, with a target completion date of June 2024.

**Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program (Pre-Rulemaking)**  
The LCFS program is designed to encourage the use and production of low carbon transportation fuels. The LCFS is a market-based program that is based on declining carbon intensity (CI) benchmarks; transportation fuels that have a CI lower than the benchmark generate LCFS credits, and those with higher a CI generate credit deficits. LCFS credits associated with electricity can be generated in several categories, depending on the type and location of the charging; proceeds must generally support transportation electrification projects or programs. Utilities, including SMUD, currently receive “base credits” that are allocated based on estimated EV charging within their service areas. A minimum portion of these base credits funds the statewide Clean Fuel Reward (CFR) program; the remaining “holdback” credits fund utility-specific programs, with minimum spending requirements for projects benefiting low-income and disadvantaged communities. SMUD currently generates credits through partnerships with dairies that produce digester gas for low-carbon electricity.

CARB is currently developing amendments to the LCFS regulation to increase the stringency of the program and displace additional fossil fuels, strengthen equity provisions, and support zero-emission charging infrastructure, among other objectives. Proposed changes include an immediate step-down in CI and inclusion of an auto-acceleration mechanism, changes to capacity credits for ZEV infrastructure, and changes to avoided methane crediting. At this time, CARB has not proposed any changes to base crediting.

low credit prices. Through our membership in CalETC, we are also advocating for changes to the CFR and utility holdback programs to improve program impact, adaptability, and focus on the needs of priority communities. SMUD is also monitoring how potential changes to avoided methane crediting would affect our existing partnerships.

**Status:** The formal rulemaking process is expected to begin late this year, with a targeted effective date in mid-2024.

### Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) Program
The CEC's Demand Side Grid Support (DSGS) program was established last summer as part of the new Strategic Reliability Reserve created by AB 205. The program provides incentives to utility customers that provide incremental net load reductions during grid emergencies or extreme events. DSGS providers, which may include POUs, enroll customers and administer the program; depending on the participation option, providers receive administrative cost reimbursement or incentives for committed load reduction capacity. After an accelerated initial launch last summer, the CEC revised the program guidelines in 2023 to reflect lessons learned, expand eligibility allow third-party aggregators to serve as program administrators under certain conditions, and pilot new participation options.

The current DSGS program includes three participation pathways, originally designed with the CAISO in mind:
- **Option 1**, which provides incentives to customers that voluntarily reduce net load in response to Energy Emergency Alerts (EEAs) issued by a California balancing authority (BA).
- **Option 2**, which provides monthly capacity payments for demand response resources participating in electricity markets that can provide additional load reduction capability.
- **Option 3**, which provides monthly capacity payments for behind-the-meter battery virtual power plants that dispatch based on market or other reliability-related signals.

SMUD successfully advocated for flexibility allowing non-CAISO balancing authority areas to benefit from the DSGS program and for POUs to propose alternative program requirements that are best suited for the reliability needs of the POU and their BA. In coordination with CMUA, SMUD also successfully advocated for changes requiring third-party aggregators to obtain written permission from the host POU before becoming a DSGS provider, to ensure any DSGS activities are coordinated with POU needs and operations.

**Status:** The CEC adopted the revised DSGS guidelines in July 2023. SMUD enrolled as a DSGS provider for “Option 1” this summer. SMUD is exploring options for potential implementation of “Option 3” in summer 2024 and will continue to work with the CEC on program updates.

### Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety Recommendations on General Orders
The Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety (OEIS) has initiated a process to make formal recommendations to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) regarding safety requirements to mitigate the risk of wildfires brought on by climate change and aging infrastructure, including potential updates to General Order (GO) 95, GO 128, and GO 165. OEIS has commissioned a study that will consider a wide range of topic areas, including vegetation management, local conditions, temperature and loading, strength of materials, inspection of lines, replacement, undergrounding, inspection requirements, and standards for operation during disasters and emergencies.

OEIS has not yet released a proposal with specific recommendations. However, any recommendations developed by OEIS and accepted by the CPUC could have a significant impact on the industry.

**GM 23-208 Board Monitoring Report – SD-11, Public Power Business Model Page 13 of 18**

**Standards that SMUD Follows**  
Through CMUA, SMUD has advocated that OEIS allow for a thorough public review and input process prior to submitting recommendations to the CPUC, as well as considering whether any proposed recommendations would be more appropriately considered as mitigation measures selected through the utility Wildfire Mitigation Plan development process.  
**Status:** OEIS anticipates developing recommendations to transmit to the CPUC in late 2023. Such recommendations are expected to feed into the CPUC’s climate change adaptation proceeding, which will explore changes to existing safety requirements.

**CPUC Pole Attachments Database Proceeding**  
As part of its investigation considering strategies for increased and non-discriminatory access to utility poles and conduit by competitive communications providers, the CPUC has established requirements for IOUs to maintain certain pole attachment data in an online database accessible to attaching entities. In December 2022, the CPUC issued a new ruling considering whether such requirements should apply to POUs and whether the CPUC should also develop online database requirements for conduit information.  
SMUD does not support the proposed application of database requirements to POUs or the expansion to include conduit information. Through our membership in CMUA, SMUD has disputed the CPUC’s assertion of jurisdiction over POUs for imposing requirements for the convenience and access of pole attachers. CMUA also recommended against developing requirements for conduit information, given that conduit does not pose the same safety risks as overloaded poles and there are greater security and safety risks associated with sharing of conduit information.  
**Status:** SMUD is awaiting the issuance of the CPUC’s proposed decision.

**2025 Energy Code – Pre-Rulemaking Activities**  
The CEC is in the process of developing proposals for the 2025 Energy Code. The new code is expected to continue the trend toward more heat pump space heating (HPSH) and heat pump water heating (HPWH) through prescriptive requirements for new single-family homes, multifamily, and select nonresidential building types. The CEC also proposes including prescriptive heat pump requirements for alterations of existing single-family homes, where demonstrated to be cost effective. The proposed changes also include updates to efficiency standards and certain photovoltaic and energy storage requirements, including a clarification to community solar requirements.  
SMUD supports the trend to encourage all-electric new construction, particularly in single family homes. SMUD is also monitoring and providing feedback on proposals that could impact requirements for community solar administrator, based on our unique perspective as the only currently-approved administrator for purposes of the Energy Code. This summer, SMUD recommended against changes to community solar opt-out requirements for multifamily buildings that would have added significant complexity with uncertain practical benefits; such changes were not included in the latest pre-rulemaking amendments.  
**Status:** The formal rulemaking process for the 2025 Energy Code is expected to begin in January 2024. If approved, the 2025 Energy Code requirements will go into effect for construction permits that are applied on or after January 1, 2026.
<!-- Page 72 -->
![Load Management Standard (LMS) Regulation](https://example.com/image.png)

**Load Management Standard (LMS) Regulation**  
The amended LMS regulations were adopted by the CEC in October 2022 and took effect on April 1, 2023, expanding on efforts to increase efficiency and demand flexibility in California’s electricity grid. While the standard has been in statute since 1978, the most recent amendments are intended to form the foundation of a statewide system that automates the creation of hourly or sub-hourly costs and signals that can be used by end-use automation to provide real-time demand flexibility on the grid. The amended regulations require the state’s three largest IOUs and CCAs, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) and SMUD to develop marginal cost-based rates that change at least hourly for each customer class that is determined to materially reduce peak load, among other requirements.

During the rulemaking process, SMUD staff advocated to CEC staff, Commissioners, and other key policymakers to help guide the development of the LMS and ensure that SMUD can continue to offer pilots and programs as an alternative to dynamic rates. The final regulations largely reflected our recommendations for a separate compliance pathway for POUs that provides greater implementation flexibility.

**Status:** The new LMS regulations went into effect in April 2023. This year, SMUD has continued outreach to the CEC regarding our LMS compliance approach. We also successfully completed our first two compliance milestones: uploading our existing time-dependent rates into an online CEC database and submitting our proposed compliance plan to the SMUD Board of Directors by October 1.

**Delta Water and Hydro Impacts**  
Two substantial Delta planning processes could potentially affect energy available for SMUD’s purchase from the Central Valley Project (CVP) and flows within the Upper American River Project (UARP) watershed: the Bay–Delta Water Quality Control Plan (Bay–Delta Plan), and the Delta Conveyance Project (successor to the California WaterFix project, which was in turn succeeded by the Bay Delta Conservation Plan).

Phase 2 of the Bay–Delta Plan is ongoing and could potentially affect SMUD by increasing the volume of water required for outflow into the Bay (Phase 3 would, if carried out, implement Phase 2 through modifications to water rights). A substantial change in Delta outflow and tributary flow requirements could, among other things, have a major impact on the timing of hydroelectric energy generation. The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) staff released a draft of one of the Phase 2 documents identifying an environmental need for significantly more outflows (in short, 35 to 75% of all water is allegedly needed for outflow with staff recommending 45 to 65%).

Governor Newsom requested the SWRCB explore negotiation of voluntary agreements with water purveyors in lieu of imposing a strict plan. Work on the voluntary agreements process has been slow and sporadic but still appears to be the preferred path for compromise.

Although the earlier, two-tunnel Delta conveyance WaterFix Project was cancelled and its environmental documents rescinded in 2019, the Department of Water Resources (DWR) quickly relaunched the project as a one-tunnel option, renamed the Delta Conveyance Project. The Draft Environmental Impact Report was released in July 2022. The project would involve building one new intake and a tunnel to complement the historical diversion of water through the Delta channels for the State Water Project (SWP). It had been expected the Project would involve the CVP as well, though that does not appear to be the case and the U.S. Bureau of  

**GM 23-208**

**Page 14 of 18**

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Reclamation has not been participating, suggesting no CVP power would be used for the project. This is important because if provided by the CVP, power for the estimated 10-year construction effort and long-term operations would come out of supplies otherwise sold to public power contractors, the single largest share of which goes to SMUD under an existing long-term contract (which will be succeeded a new contract). Using the tunnels would be part of an effort to maintain or even increase Delta watershed exports to Southern and Central California. Proponents have claimed the project would help reduce the historical impacts of the South of Delta pumps on special status fish species, though modeling by Northern California interests of the prior project suggests the reduced impacts have not been proven and in fact the opposite could be true. Modeling of the newly proposed project is under way. Changes in the timing of the energy generation due to the project are as yet unclear.

Staff Comment: SMUD is working closely with a coalition of water interests to evaluate the impacts of the Bay–Delta Plan and the Delta Conveyance Project to understand the implications for power generation and SMUD’s water rights and hopefully agree upon a voluntary agreement substitute for a regulated process.

Federal Legislation that Impacted SD-11

H.R. 3746 (McHenry): Raising the Debt Limit  
The “Fiscal Responsibility Act” became law on June 3, 2023. It would raise the federal debt limit, establish new discretionary spending limits, and makes reforms to the federal permitting process (particularly as it relates to the National Environmental Policy Act or NEPA). SMUD supported the increase to the debt limit as a default would have had a significant material impact on the national economy. SMUD also supported meaningful and balanced reforms to NEPA, which will facilitate energy infrastructure deployment. Previous iterations of the legislation, including H.R. 2811, House Republicans’ initial version of the debt limit bill, would have repealed several clean energy tax credits as well as the direct pay provisions of the IRA. SMUD opposed these provisions and worked directly with its federal delegation and trade associations to push back on the bill.

Tax Policy  
As a municipal utility, SMUD relies on municipal bonds and utilizes all available financing mechanisms to decrease the financing costs of infrastructure investments and projects. Therefore, SMUD has continued to advocate for maintaining the longstanding tax exemption for municipal bond interest as well as preserving the ability of municipal utilities to make an election for elective payment of energy tax credits as authorized under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) preserved the general exemption, but removed it for advance refunding bonds, which are used to effectively refinance an original bond. SMUD has worked individually and through coalitions like APPA, and the Alliance to Save Energy’s 50X50 Commission to restore the exemption for advance refunding bonds. Bipartisan bills in both the House and Senate have been proposed that would restore advanced refunding. Such legislation is unlikely to be passed as a stand-alone bill; however, restoring advance refunding may be considered as part of a tax reform package as several tax provisions in the TCJA are set to expire at the end of 2025.

The 2022 IRA includes a provision that allows tax-exempt entities to receive refundable elective payments of various energy tax credits, making them directly available to public power utilities for the first time. Both the House and Senate have introduced provisions in various legislation that would repeal energy tax credits authorized under the law; however, none have been advanced. SMUD has worked individually and through coalitions like the American Public Power Association (APPA) and

Bipartisan bills in both the House and Senate have been proposed that would restore advance refunding. A provision to restore advance refunding was included in the bond financing title of an early House version of the budget reconciliation bill. The Inflation Reduction Act omitted the advance refunding provision, and it is unlikely to be passed as a stand-alone bill, however the provision may return next year as Congress looks to put together a tax reform package. Federal Affairs will continue to track this issue.](https://example.com/image1)

## Pole Attachments
Municipal utilities are exempt from federal regulation of pole attachments under Section 224 of the Federal Communications Act. However, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken steps in recent years that impact public power pole attachments. In September 2018 the FCC issued a declaratory order and ruling reinterpreting other sections of the law to impose fee limits and timelines on pole attachment applications. Most recently, in March 2022, the FCC approved a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM) on the allocation of pole replacement costs and the resolution of pole attachment disputes. SMUD has expressed its delegation concerns about this federal intrusion, noting that it has developed pole attachment agreements with telecom carriers. Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) introduced legislation in January 2019 to nullify the 2018 FCC order, and Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) sponsored similar legislation in the Senate in June 2019. The bills have failed to gain bipartisan support or traction in either chamber and they have not been reintroduced in subsequent congressional sessions.

## Appropriations
As has been customary for many years, Congressional appropriators failed to pass yearly funding bills by the end of the fiscal year (Sept 30). Despite opposition from several members of the House Republican majority, Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) advanced a continuing resolution (CR) to keep the government funded through Nov. 17, 2023, which resulted in the disaffected members banding with the Democratic Caucus to oust McCarthy from the Speakership under rules negotiated at the beginning of the 118th Congress. Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) has taken over the speakership.

## Spent Nuclear Fuel Removal
Unable to make progress on removing spent nuclear fuel to interim storage facilities, congressional attention has turned to reprocessing and establishing a consent-based process for siting new facilities. The House Fiscal Year 24 Energy & Water Appropriations bill prohibits funds from being used to site an interim storage facility, and the Senate bill directs the Department of Energy to identify a site for interim storage using consent-based principles.

## Federal Regulatory Issues That Impacted SD-11
### FERC Order 1000
SMUD has participated in Order 1000 regional transmission planning through WestConnect, a regional planning entity that is comprised of member transmission providers (both jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional transmission providers) with service areas consisting of all or portions of eleven states. WestConnect members work collaboratively to jointly plan transmission facilities, assess stakeholder and market needs and develop cost-effective enhancements to the western wholesale electricity market.

In 2015, FERC accepted WestConnect’s withdrawal rights for non-jurisdictional transmission providers such as SMUD. Accordingly, if costs are allocated for particular transmission projects that are unacceptable, the non-jurisdictional transmission provider has a right to withdraw from the cost.

**allocation determination.** El Paso Electric, a WestConnect jurisdictional transmission provider, appealed FERC’s decision in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals contending that a non-jurisdictional’s decision not to accept cost allocation for a project will cause free ridership. On August 2, 2023, the 5th Circuit issued a decision reversing FERC’s WestConnect order, concluding that FERC’s order implementing Order 1000 for the WestConnect region is not a just and reasonable application of cost allocation. FERC declined to seek rehearing, and accordingly, there is uncertainty at this time on the future of WestConnect’s regional planning process. SMUD, along with the other non-jurisdictionals, are exploring options for continued planning that will ensure we are able to decide whether to accept costs for a transmission project.

Meanwhile, in April 2022, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation and Generator Interconnection (NOPR) seeking comments on reforms to existing regulations under Order 1000 to plan the grid for the future and address the nation’s changing resource mix. SMUD worked with LPPC, APPA, and the Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) to develop separate comments in response to the NOPR. FERC also hosted a technical conference with industry experts to discuss certain transmission planning and cost allocation issues, including proposals in the NOPR. FERC has yet to issue an order. We will continue to monitor the rulemaking to ensure our public power interests are represented.

**EIM and EDAM**  
SMUD has a direct interest in finding long-term solutions to the challenges posed by the integration of intermittent resources, such as wind and solar. One solution has been the development of an EIM operated by the CAISO, and another solution has been what the CAISO refers to as an “Extended Day Ahead Market” (EDAM). In general, the EIM is a sub- hourly energy platform that automatically clears and dispatches the lowest cost electricity available to serve demand on a real-time basis, with EDAM providing similar functionality but with a day-ahead resource and scheduling commitment.

SMUD joined in spring of 2019 under what is referred to as “Phase 1” of BANC’s EIM participation as the first municipal participant. SMUD has successfully participated in the EIM since go-live on April 3, 2019, which has provided reliability, operational flexibility, and financial benefits.

The rest of BANC, including the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) – Sierra Nevada Region, joined the EIM on March 25, 2021, under what is referred to as BANC EIM “Phase 2.” This broader BANC resource participation in EIM has resulted in additional economic benefits and a greater ability to integrate and manage intermittent resources within the BANC BAA.

Given the success of EIM, the CAISO, with the support of SMUD and BANC, as well as other EIM participants, launched a stakeholder initiative to develop an extension of the EIM real time framework to the CAISO’s day ahead market, referred to as the EDAM. Like EIM, EDAM would broaden the access to regional resources for the reliable integration of renewable resources, only over a longer (day ahead) time horizon, and participation is voluntary. SMUD (along with BANC) was given a seat at the table in the development of EDAM. After a few years of negotiations, along with discussions and stakeholder meetings, the CAISO Board of Governors and WEIM Governing Body jointly approved the EDAM framework in February of 2023. On August 22, 2023, the CAISO filed an EDAM tariff amendment with the FERC, to which SMUD filed supportive comments. Pending FERC’s approval of the filing, EDAM implementation activities are planned for 2024 with EDAM launch as early as 2025. SMUD plans to participate in EDAM beginning in the 2026 timeframe, depending on its implementation efforts and coordination with other BANC participants. SMUD and
<!-- Page 76 -->
other EIM Entities believe EDAM is an important step forward in the evolution of Western energy markets and intermittent resource integration by allowing participants to decommit less efficient resources in the day ahead timeframe, as opposed to only in the shorter real time window. Thus, EDAM aligns well with SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan goals. Moreover, like EIM, EDAM remains a voluntary market, allowing SMUD the added flexibility of pivoting later, should better options arise in the future.

**Greenhouse Gas Regulation**  
On May 11, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed greenhouse gas emissions standards for fossil-fueled power plants under Sec. 111 of the Clean Air Act. New and reconstructed plants would need to either use highly efficient generation or install carbon capture technology (CCS) or co-fire with hydrogen, depending on the capacity factor of the resource. Existing large units (over 300 MW with a capacity factor over 50%) would be subject to a standard equivalent to either 90 percent capture of CO2 using CCS by 2035, or co-firing of 30% hydrogen beginning in 2032 and co-firing 96% hydrogen beginning in 2038. Existing coal plants that plan to operate after 2040 would need to capture 90% of their emissions, but those that commit to closing earlier would be subject to a less stringent standard. SMUD is monitoring this proposal, which would have minimal impacts on SMUD if enacted as proposed, but it could be expanded to cover additional units in a way that would pose challenges for SMUD’s expected timelines for closure of its natural gas plants.

President Sanborn then turned to Discussion Calendar Items 12.a. and 12.b. pertaining to the 2024 Budget. She stated Item 12.a. is to adopt the 2024 Budget which, among other things, establishes:

- An Operations and Maintenance Budget of $1,386.1 million (including Public Goods Charge of $67.9 million);
- A Debt Service budget of $202.3 million;
- A Capital and Reserve Budget of $555 million; and
- Authorized contingencies.

She stated Item 12.b. is a Declaration of Intent to Issue Debt to create $400 million of additional bonding authority to reimburse for qualifying capital expenditures, and Official Intent to reimburse for 2024 and 2023 capital expenditures from bond proceeds, which is required to maintain tax-exempt financing capability.

Jennifer Restivo, Director of Planning & Performance, gave a presentation regarding the 2024 Budget and borrowing authority. A copy of the slides used in her presentation is attached hereto.

No public comment was forthcoming for Discussion Calendar Items 12.a. or 12.b.

After some discussion, Director Bui-Thompson moved for approval of Agenda Item 12.a., Vice President Herber seconded, and Resolution No. 23-12-09 was approved by a vote of 4-0, with Directors Rose, Fishman, and Kerth absent.

# RESOLUTION NO. 23-12-09

WHEREAS, the proposed 2024 Budget is expected to result in a positive net income for 2024; NOW THEREFORE,

BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT:

## Section 1.
This resolution may be referred to as the 2024 Budget Resolution.

## Section 2.
(a) There is hereby appropriated from the General Fund sufficient monies for the payment of demands against SMUD which relate to obligations incurred for the purposes and within the amount specified for such purposes in the following projection of SMUD's program for the period January 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024.

### Operations and maintenance:
- Commodity - purchased power, fuel, and wheeling: $572,000,004
- Public Goods: $67,888,971
- Customer, energy delivery, enterprise strategy, workforce diversity & inclusion, information technology, corporate services and Rancho Seco: $746,217,455

**Sub-Total:** $1,386,106,430

### Debt Service
- Capital and reserve: $202,263,155
- $554,965,979

**TOTAL:** $2,143,353,564

(b) The Commodity line item budget is based on assumptions of average rainfall and temperatures during 2024. SMUD has in place a Hydro Generation Adjustment (SMUD HGA) mechanism whereby, based on the actual rainfall amounts between April 1, 2023 and March 31, 2024 in comparison to the budget assumptions, SMUD may transfer funds to or from the Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund and, once pre-established limits are met, increase or decrease customer rates. The Commodity line item budget will be increased or reduced based on the actual transfer and/or change in customer revenues from the SMUD HGA adjustment.
<!-- Page 79 -->
(c) SMUD also has in place or may enter into additional agreements under which monies will be received by SMUD in the event actual weather conditions are drier than average. In the event of below average rainfall, the Commodity line item budget will be increased by an amount equal to the payments received under these contracts.

(d) SMUD has budgeted to receive energy in 2024 under its contract with the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA). SMUD has in place a WAPA Hydro Generation Adjustment (WAPA HGA) mechanism whereby, based on the actual delivery from WAPA between April 1, 2023 and March 31, 2024 in comparison to the budget assumptions, SMUD may transfer funds to or from the WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund and, once pre-established limits are met, increase or decrease customer rates. This energy primarily is generated at Central Valley Project hydroelectric plants, and the actual quantity of energy received will be dependent on rainfall, carryover water storage and operation of the WAPA system to meet contractual water deliveries. Because WAPA generation facilities are spread over a wide area, insurance is not practical for offsetting variations of energy deliveries due to weather. One purpose of the Rate Stabilization Fund is to mitigate such variations. The Commodity line item budget will be increased or reduced based on the actual transfer and/or change in customer revenues from the WAPA HGA adjustment.

(e) Budgeted energy purchases necessary to meet customer energy sales requirements (10,302 GWh) are based on average weather conditions and expected customer growth in 2024. Should actual weather conditions or growth levels cause SMUD retail sales and related energy requirements to be higher, the Commodity line item budget will be increased by the NP15 power price per megawatt-hour of additional retail energy sales to offset the cost of these sales.

(f) SMUD participates in regulatory programs such as Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and Cap-and-Trade. Under these programs, SMUD has the option to monetize the credits and allowances applicable to these programs through sales transactions. When SMUD collects revenues through

Accountant. Investment authority, for all funds, is delegated to the Treasurer for a one-year period in accordance with California Code Section 53607.

**Section 5.** The number of permanent full-time employees during 2024 shall not exceed 2,250 employees plus a five percent contingency without further authorization of this Board.

**Section 6.** The Public Goods Charge shall be adjusted from 16.77 percent of 1994 revenues to 16.28 percent of 1994 revenues. The percentage allocation for the public goods charge expenditures shall be adjusted from 6.60 percent to 7.22 percent for low-income assistance, and from 8.16 percent to 7.7 percent for energy efficiency, and from 2.01 percent to 1.37 percent for research and development, and stayed the same at 0.00 percent for new renewable generation.

President Sanborn then turned to Discussion Calendar Item 13, to discuss a possible merit increase to the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager’s base salary and/or performance bonus, pursuant to the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager’s employment contract.  

Director Rose arrived at 5:53 p.m.  

President Sanborn stated that the Board had met in closed session, and there was nothing more that could have been asked of Mr. Lau as CEO, and all major items of merit had been beautifully executed, especially in light of the many challenges.  

Vice President Herber stated she had worked at SMUD for 20 years and spent much of that time with Mr. Lau. She noted that he had grown into a tremendous leader, instilling in staff that equity, diversity and inclusion is paramount and ensuring the underserved are included as the world turns electric. She stated Mr. Lau had done an exceptional job, and his salary should reflect that.  

Director Bui-Thompson thanked Mr. Lau for his service. She stated that the CEO salary is comparatively high to other executives in the public sector space, but she noted that what sets SMUD apart is that it is a public entity that is admired in the public sector space. She noted SMUD keeps the lights on, the rates low, and satisfaction high, and that is due to staff’s good work. She stated that good work should be compensated appropriately.  

President Sanborn announced that Directors Fishman and Kerth had arrived (at 5:54 p.m. and 5:57 p.m., respectively).  

Director Fishman read from an email that he had sent Mr. Lau earlier in the week, wherein he had expressed that although Mr. Lau had done an exemplary job, he did not feel he could support a raise in salary. He concluded that he had come to the meeting prepared to be the outlier and vote no on the salary increase; however, in light of the accomplishments of the week including a large grant award and industry accolades, he was now prepared to approve and vote yes.
<!-- Page 88 -->
Director Kerth stated that Mr. Lau had done a wonderful job and deserved to be compensated. He thanked Mr. Lau for his service to the community.

Director Rose stated he had spent a lot of time with Mr. Lau in the previous week at COP 28, and his one his takeaways from the trip was that SMUD is a world class organization doing world class work that was far and away ahead of the rest of the field. He noted that the CEO salary is one of the most difficult discussions the Board annually encounters, and he supported the increase. He noted that if there were any members of the public who had concerns and ever wanted to have a discussion about CEO salaries, he invited them to email him, and he would be happy to have the conversation.

Director Tamayo stated it was easy for him to support the merit increase. He noted that Mr. Lau had done an incredible job, and his decision was based upon where SMUD stands with the community, the level of service provided, and the level of satisfaction amongst the community.

President Sanborn stated she has also been at COP 28 with Mr. Lau and had witnessed how taken people were with what SMUD is doing. She stated that she wished the increase could be more, but the Board had discussed in closed session a five percent cost of living plus seven percent merit increase.

Ms. Lewis clarified that the cost of living adjustment had been applied to Mr. Lau’s salary automatically as required under his employment contract, so she believed the motion would be a merit increase of seven percent.

No public comment was forthcoming for Agenda Item 13.

There being no further discussion, Director Tamayo moved to approve a merit increase of seven percent, and Director Bui-Thompson seconded. Resolution No. 23-12-11 was unanimously approved.

(APMC) and Plumbers Union Local 447 holiday event, and the Central Labor Council’s Holiday Festival. He concluded by reporting on his attendance at a discussion hosted by the Environmental Council of Sacramento (ECOS) about Reducing Carbon in the Built Environment.  

Director Tamayo reported on his tour of SMUD’s transformer vaults in the downtown network and thanked Eric Poff, Director of Substations, Telecommunications & Metering Assets, and Sean Stevens, Substation Assets Supervisor, for accompanying him. He then reported on his attendance at the Elk Grove Economic Equity Symposium and the Catalyst Green Hydrogen Conference. He then reported on his interview with Leah Miller, CEO of Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento, and Scott Syphax about SMUD’s efforts to collaborate with Habitat for Humanity and other affordable housing organizations. He noted that the interview was held at Shattered Records, a commercial recording studio that allows an organization called Department of Sound to use their facilities to help youth in the community learn how to work with recording equipment.  

President Sanborn reported on her attendance at the Central Labor Council’s Salute to Labor. She then reported on her attendance at COP 28 in Dubai, where SMUD and Southern California Edison were the first two United States utilities to sign an international pledge to achieve net zero by 2050 and SMUD also received a certificate of appreciation by the Climate Bonds Initiative.

for being the first U.S. issuer of certified climate bonds. She thanked Alberto Ayala and Jaime Lemus from the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District for their partnership on the trip. She reported on her speaking engagement at the Greater Sacramento Economic Council (GSEC) Get engaged forum at Sac State as well as her attendance at the Solano 4 Wind Project blade signing event. She concluded by reporting on her attendance at Run to Feed the Hungry.

Paul Lau, Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, thanked the Board for not only their leadership but for embracing the bold clean energy vision and for recognizing staff for all of the work. He then reported on the following items:

1) **Grants.** I want to start my report by saying what an amazing year it was. Earlier today we were excited to learn from the Department of Energy (DOE) that SMUD, along with Calpine Corporation, was the successful recipient of a $270 million grant on the carbon capture and storage project in Yuba City. The grant was one of only three in the nation to put in this new technology that will come online by 2027, just in time for our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. Additionally, the DOE awarded a $50 million grant to SMUD for the outage management system to work with our disadvantaged communities like Wilton Rancheria to advance electrification and build the workforce of the future. And then just yesterday we found out we won $5 million from the California Energy Commission (CEC) that will help with getting electric vehicle (EV) charging into multi-family unit. SMUD will partner with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District, Uber and other local partners to put in approximately 270 EV chargers at 26 locations. I spoke with Chair Hochschild today that SMUD may now be the first utility in California that actually has a viable pathway to get to zero carbon by 2030. Additionally, we added
<!-- Page 93 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/1265x768.png?text=Document+Image)

100 MW of geothermal, repurposed our smaller wind farms to larger 4MW Vestas units to give us another 85 MW of wind, and on top of that, we now have two projects to put utility scale solar and batteries into two solar farms. We have a partnership with ESS to put 4 MW of utility scale long duration batteries, so this has obviously been a very, very good year for SMUD. Last year was a year of planning, and this year was a year of execution, so we are right on plan in terms of doing what we need to do to get to 2030. With the grant award today, we now have a very viable way to get the last 10%.

2) COP28. As you heard from President Sanborn and Director Rose, we and Chief Legal & Government Affairs Officer Laura Lewis all attended the Climate Change conference in Dubai. It was inspirational and gave me a lot of hope. President Sanborn and I were able to attend the Blue Zone which was the 25,000 people who are actively negotiating and doing things across the 210 countries there, to advance a zero carbon economy. It was encouraging to see the White House, Germany, Canada, and Australia signing on to use green aluminum and green concrete and for the CEOs of Coke and Pepsi to say they were committed to creating the market to buy all those green products. It was especially meaningful because this was the first time in COP’s 28-year history that all 210 countries agreed to move away from fossil fuel. This was also the first time that COP has introduced both nuclear and carbon capture sequestration as a viable alternative, which they did not previously consider. As one person noted, optionality is no longer an option - if you are seriously going to try to get to 1.5 degree, and try to tackle climate change, you have got to put everything on the table and collaborate across the world in order for us to get there. It was a very moving experience. I want to

1) **Winter Storms**. Winter is just around the corner. As you know, we work year-round to prevent outages. Last year, we had the storm of the century with nearly 600,000 customers out. I want to say a special thanks to Chief Operating Officer Frankie McDermott and his team who have been working tirelessly to look at all of the things that we need to do to prepare for the storms. We are revamping the entire process, from the back office and how we do assessments, how to get more crews online, how to get more poles, how to get contractors here as quickly as possible, and creating more statuses on our outage maps so people know exactly where they are at, and we have completely redone the process on how to do outage restoration, especially in the event that customers have outages for multiple days. In the near future, we will provide the Board a demonstration on what the new outage management and communications look like. We hope this is another Y2K exercise where we are prepared for the storms, but we hope we do not experience another storm of the century for many years.

2) **Chief Financial Officer Retirement**. Next, something a little bittersweet. Saying goodbye to our dear friend and colleague, CFO Jennifer Davidson, who will be retiring next month after 17 plus years of service at SMUD! I have worked with many CFOs in my 41-year career here, and I must say that Jennifer is one of the best, if not the best, CFOs that SMUD has had. Jennifer, we are going to miss you a lot. I know she has three grandkids that she cannot wait to spend more time with, and, in fact, we spoke with her husband, and he has already bought season tickets for the Chicago Cubs. Jennifer, you leave a lasting mark.
<!-- Page 95 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/1265x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

on SMUD. It is not every often that a CEO gets to live through COVID, a market shutdown, and worldwide supply chain issues where SMUD could not get transformers for the first time in its history, the heatwave, volatile gas prices, and the outage of our biggest power plant right before summer. Jennifer navigated the unexpected challenges without really impacting the customer. We did not actually need an emergency rate increase like a lot of our neighbors, and we were also able to keep our credit rating, which is the highest it has been for the past 35 years. Jennifer, we are going to miss you a lot. You have been not only a great colleague but a great friend, and SMUD was very, very fortunate to have you for 17 years. We will miss you tremendously but we also wish you a great time spending time with your kids.

5) Board Video. Finally, we are ready to take a look at last month’s video which is focused on energy storage. President Sanborn requested the Summary of Board Direction, but there were no items.

President Sanborn thanked Jennifer Davidson for her service. She then thanked the Board Office staff and Special Assistant Crystal Henderson for their work throughout the year. She thanked the Board for the privilege of having served as President. She then stated she would turn it over to Vice President Herber to adjourn the meeting in memoriam.

Vice President Herber congratulated President Sanborn on a successful year. She then stated that her brother-in-law had passed away recently, and when she had gone to the blade signing event in Solano County, she had placed her initials and his initials on the turbine as a tribute and thanked staff for the opportunity to do that.

No further business appearing, Vice President Herber adjourned the meeting in memory of Michael Andrew Franke at 6:58 p.m.

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his delegate, to execute the third amendment to the California Oregon Transmission Project (COTP) Long-Term Layoff Agreement (Agreement) by and among the Transmission Agency of Northern California (TANC) and certain of its members, namely, SMUD, Modesto Irrigation District (MID), the Turlock Irrigation District (TID), the City of Palo Alto (Palo Alto), and the City of Roseville (Roseville), substantially in form attached, to extend the existing Agreement for an additional 10 years to January 31, 2034.  

**Summary:**  
Pursuant to Resolution No. 90-03-10, SMUD, Palo Alto, MID, Roseville, and TID are each Participants in and parties to TANC Project Agreement No. 3 (“TANC PA 3”), entered into March 1, 1990, for the funding, construction, and operation of the COTP.  

Pursuant to Resolution No. 09-01-05, SMUD entered into a Long-Term Layoff Agreement on February 1, 2009, with TANC and certain of its members, namely, Palo Alto, Roseville, MID, and TID wherein Palo Alto and Roseville laid off their entitlement to TANC’s Transfer Capability on the COTP associated with their participation percentages under TANC PA 3 for the term of the Agreement.  

In the Agreement, MID, Roseville, TID, and SMUD accepted and assumed all of Palo Alto and Roseville’s participation percentages under TANC PA 3 for the term of the Agreement, with SMUD acquiring 35 MW of capacity in the north-to-south direction and 27 MW in the south-to-north direction on the COTP.  

Pursuant to Resolution No. 14-04-08, SMUD executed Amendment No. 1 to the Agreement effective July 1, 2014, which returned Roseville’s COTP interests, rights, and obligations from MID, TID, and SMUD back to Roseville, and clarified Palo Alto’s voting rights under TANC PA 3.  

SMUD executed Amendment No. 2 to the Agreement on May 26, 2016, pursuant to authorization under Resolution No. 14-04-08, which provided that in the absence of a default by MID, TID, and SMUD, Debt Service for the 2016A Bonds and any extension thereof associated with Palo Alto’s 3.6815 participation percentage in TANC’s entitlement to transfer capability on the COTP would be paid by MID, TID, and SMUD.  

The Parties have negotiated on this Amendment No. 3 to extend the Agreement for an additional 10 years to January 31, 2034 to ensure that all of Palo Alto’s interests, rights, and obligations associated with its participation percentage under TANC PA 3 continue to be laid off to MID, TID, and SMUD (with SMUD maintaining 22 MW north-to-south and 17 MW south-to-north transfer capability) for the extended term of the Agreement and to add an annual market payment to Palo Alto from MID, TID, and SMUD. This Amendment No. 3, by modifying the term of the Agreement, will also extend the term of Roseville’s layoff of its South of Tesla (“SOT”) allocation, originally described in Section 4 of the Agreement.  

The Agreement will expire on January 31, 2024, if this Amendment Number 3 is not approved.

![Board Policy](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Board Policy:**
- Strategic Direction SD-2, Competitive Rates; Strategic Direction SD-4, Reliability; Strategic Direction SD-9, Resource Planning

**Benefits:**
- SMUD will maintain 22 MW north-to-south and 17 MW south-to-north of additional transmission capacity on the COTP. The Amendment will enable SMUD to continue to import additional amounts of Northwest Power from outside the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) grid, avoid the associated CAISO fees, enhance SMUD's import reliability through the purchase of more firm energy, and provide an opportunity for SMUD to pursue additional long-term renewable power supply agreements with projects located in northern California or from points beyond in the long-term.

**Cost/Budgeted:**
- The expected annual cost for SMUD’s share of this Agreement is approximately $755,000 (including the market payment) and is included in the budget for 2024 and beyond. SMUD’s share of the market payment is approximately $244,000 per year in the first five years and $355,000 per year in the last five years.

**Alternatives:**
- Forego the opportunity to continue having an additional 22 MW north-to-south and 17 MW south-to-north of COTP capacity and continue utilizing the existing import capability SMUD has on PG&E's grid across CAISO's Balancing Authority.

**Affected Parties:**
- SMUD, TANC, the City of Palo Alto, MID, TID, and the City of Roseville.

**Coordination:**
- Energy Trading & Contracts and Legal

**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:** Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to award contracts to Siemens Energy, Inc., ILJIN Electric USA, Inc., Mader Supply LLC, PTI Transformers LP, and WEG Transformers USA LLC to manufacture and provide Generation, Distribution and Transmission Power Transformers during the five-year period of February 1, 2024, to January 31, 2029, with one optional two-year extension for a total aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount of $250,000,000.

**Summary:**  
Request for Proposals (RFP) No. Doc40937983728 was issued in July 2023 to solicit proposals to establish strategic alliance agreements with one or more power transformer suppliers for a five-year period with one optional two-year extension. The not-to-exceed aggregate amount including funding to order 70 transformer units over the next five years. The optional two-year extension will account for project or manufacturing delays. Each of the 70 units fall into 19 different transformer types or sizes and will be used in one of three areas of our overall system including; distribution, transmission, or power generation. Due to the complexity across the broad category of “large power transformers,” proposers did not bid on all 20 units or all 19 types of transformers. This solicitation was aggregated to include all large power transformer needs forecasted by SMUD over the next five years to encourage participation from as many potential global manufacturing partners as possible with the intent to award multiple category specific contracts, and, in some cases, primary and secondary sources of supply to mitigate risk of supply disruption, delays, quality or other factors. A Pre-Proposal Conference was held on July 27, 2023, with 19 attendees. On October 23, 2023, SMUD received 11 proposals that were evaluated in accordance with the advertised criteria. Of the 11 proposals received, seven were responsive. SMUD initiated and continues to negotiate with the top ranked proposers. SMUD is requesting approval to award contracts to the highest ranked proposers upon successful completion of negotiations for a total aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount of $250,000,000. The current result of the solicitation is shown below.

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and award a Sole Source contract to Siemens Industry, Inc. (“Siemens”) for the upgrade of their proprietary Energy Management System (“EMS”) for the term January 19, 2024, through December 31, 2026, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $6,000,000.

**Summary:**  
The EMS is critical to the real-time operations of SMUD's transmission, generation, distribution, gas scheduling, and commodity settlement systems. SMUD Transmission Planning and Operations is currently using the Siemens Spectrum Power 7, v2.2 EMS that was implemented in 2019. The EMS is also used to perform the Balancing Authority operations for the Balancing Authority of Northern California (BANC) and participation in the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM). The EMS was originally scheduled for an upgrade in 2026, but with projects coming online in support of the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (ZCP), it is critical that the timeline for the EMS upgrade project be expedited. This will ensure the hardware, software and other third-party products are refreshed and the EMS that supports both SMUD’s and BANC’s grid management and operations are current on vendor supported products. As this software is proprietary, Siemens is the only vendor with the access required to upgrade the EMS.

**Recommendation:**  
Award a Sole Source contract to:  
Siemens Industry, Inc.  
10900 Wayzata Blvd., Ste. 400  
Minnetonka, MN 55305  

**Comments:**  
This will be a non-standard contract that will be negotiated with and approved by SMUD Risk Management and Legal.

**Board Policy:**  
(Number & Title)  
Board-Staff Linkage BL-8, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement; Strategic Direction SD-4, Reliability; Strategic Direction SD-7, Environmental Leadership  

**Benefits:**  
The upgrade will provide minimized operational costs, new features and functionality to improve real-time monitoring and control of the grid and generation assets by Transmission Planning and Operations and will allow for a refresh of all hardware and third-party software before they are outdated and unsupported.

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
$6,000,000; Budgeted for 2024-2026 by Transmission Planning and Operations.

**Alternatives:**  
Issue a competitive solicitation to replace the entire EMS. This alternative is cost and resource prohibitive, introduces unnecessary risk to operations, and would delay integrating ZCP requirements into the system.

**Affected Parties:**  
Transmission Planning and Operations, Procurement, Warehouse and Fleet, and Siemens.

**Coordination:**  
Transmission Planning & Operations and Procurement, Warehouse & Fleet.

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to award contracts to Arrow Construction (Arrow), Nyecon, Inc. (Nyecon), Roebblen Contracting, Inc. (Roebblen) and Sierra National Construction, Inc. (SNC) to provide General Building Construction and Support Services for a three-year term from January 22, 2024, to January 21, 2027, with three optional one-year extensions, for a total aggregate contract not-to-exceed amount of $30 million.

**Summary:**  
Request for Proposals DOC402218973 (RFP) was issued in July 2023 to solicit qualified firms to provide general building construction and support services in support of the Facilities Business Unit. The solicitation was issued with a provision to award multiple contracts for an approximate three-year period. The Contractors will furnish all supervision, labor, materials, equipment, and incidentals necessary to accomplish the work in accordance with the contract. This is a master task contract that will include a variety of project types. The work may include, but is not limited to tenant improvements projects, asphalt concrete and concrete parking repairs, installation of underground utilities and site work, electrical work, demolition, soil remediation, abatement of hazardous materials, structure repair and construction, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) work, replacement of end-of-life equipment and systems, fencing, roofing, landscaping, and miscellaneous work in support of ongoing Facilities operations and design build tasks. A pre-proposal conference was held on July 27, 2023. On August 21, 2023, SMUD received four proposals that were evaluated in accordance with the advertised criteria. The rate schedule provided to the Contractors consisted of 11 items, but only two line-item rates were cost driven. SMUD pre-set the rates on items 3-11 but allowed Contractors to provide mark-up on the labor rates, items 1-2. SMUD initiated rate negotiations on those two line-item items and as a result, two of the Contractors (Nyecon and SNC) lowered their mark-up compared to their current labor rates, and the other two Contractors (Arrow and Roebblen) raised their rates. Staff determined rates to be fair and reasonable by comparing the Contractor’s proposed rates with existing contract rates. The result of the analysis determined that the proposed rates are within 5% of existing contracts. Furthermore, while the evaluated proposal amounts includes labor, subcontracting, materials, and equipment for the estimated volume of work over the term of the contracts, actual project work will be evaluated and awarded at the task or project level on a competitive basis driving further competition and cost savings to SMUD long term. The result of the evaluation and award recommendations are shown below.
