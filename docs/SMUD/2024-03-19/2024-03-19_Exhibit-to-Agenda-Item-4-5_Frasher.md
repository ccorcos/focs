**Fiscal Year 2024/2025 GRIP Grant Opportunity**

**Topic Area 1: Grid Resilience Utility and Industry Grants** (fiscal year 2024/2025, $918 million) fund comprehensive transmission and distribution technology solutions that will mitigate multiple hazards across a region or within a community.
- Hardening infrastructure with digitization and automation.
- Improving tools to restore power to the grid during outages.
- Investing in technologies to improve the efficiency of the grid, such as advanced conducting and reconductoring.

**Topic Area 3: Grid Innovation Program** (fiscal year 2024/2025, $1.82 billion) provides financial assistance to one or multiple states, Tribes, local governments, and public utility commissions to collaborate with electric grid owners and operators to deploy projects that use innovative approaches to transmission, storage, and distribution infrastructure to enhance grid resilience and reliability. Selections in this program through today’s Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will include transmission projects to support remote clean energy generation, improve interregional interconnection, and that use innovative technologies or execution approaches. The program will also prioritize projects that provide scalability, replicability, and innovation in the distribution space like district electrification, grid and resilience services from distributed energy resources, and battery energy storage systems.
