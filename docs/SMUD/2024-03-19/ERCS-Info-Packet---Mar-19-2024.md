**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Approve the issuance of SMUD 2024 Series M Revenue Bonds and/or SMUD 2024 Series N Revenue Refunding Bonds, authorize the distribution of the Preliminary Official Statement, and authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his designee to execute documents necessary to complete the refunding transaction or transactions, including the Bond Purchase Agreement or Agreements.  

**Summary:**  
SMUD has an opportunity to refund approximately $200 million of the 2009 Series V bonds and $250 million of the 2010 Series W bonds. This is anticipated to yield net present value savings of approximately $20+ million and effectively de-risk our portfolio from government rebate uncertainties. In 2009 and 2010, SMUD issued taxable bonds, receiving semi-annual federal credits to offset higher taxable interest rates. Since 2013, the federal subsidy rebate has been impacted by sequestration, resulting in a cumulative cost to SMUD of over $6 million to date. Moreover, the federal rebate is subject to periodic renewals, elevating political risk concerning potential future sequestrations. SMUD has the opportunity to refund both taxable bond issuances, lock in saving and remove political/federal subsidy sequestration risk.  

SMUD can also refund approximately $150 million of outstanding commercial paper notes in addition to issuing some new money to fund SMUD’s capital program. This transaction will refund variable rate debt with fixed rate debt, locking in debt service at current rates to reduce interest rate risk, and make the commercial paper capacity available for future capital spending and liquidity purposes.  

**Board Policy:**  
SD-2 Competitive Rates; SD-3 Access to Credit Markets  

**Benefits:**  
Locks in low interest rates, reduces interest rate risk and eliminates federal subsidy sequestration risk, and additionally, preserves borrowing capacity for future capital spending and liquidity needs. Estimated net present value savings of $20+ million.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
Transaction expenses are expected to be roughly $2 million, portion of which were included in the 2024 Budget. Debt service on the refunded bonds was included in the 2024 budget, and savings going forward will be included in any future budgets and provide for headroom for other spending.  

**Alternatives:**  
Forgo opportunity to capture savings.

Good Faith Estimate of Cost for the Bond Transaction  

---

**General Background Information**  

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) intends to execute a bond transaction in the Spring of 2024, subject to market conditions. There are two series of bonds associated with this transaction:

1. **Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M.** The purpose of this transaction is to fix-out $150 million of currently outstanding commercial paper to free up credit capacity. Additionally, SMUD plans to issue $100 million in further new money needs. The senior manager for this transaction is J.P. Morgan.

2. **Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2024 Series N.** The purpose of this transaction is to refund two existing series of SMUD’s bonds, the 2009 Series V and the 2010 Series W. Both of these series of bonds have been designated as Build America Bonds. Due to recent litigation, SMUD intends to utilize the Extraordinary Optional Redemption provision and call the bonds for both debt service savings as well as to eliminate further risk that the Build America Bond subsidy will be reduced through future Congressional action. The senior manager for this transaction is Bank of America.

Based on market conditions in the end of February, PFM believes the following information (see Attachment A) is a Good Faith Estimate of Cost of the Bond Transaction as required by Government Code Section 5852.1.

WHEREAS, revenue bonds may be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Master Resolution and Article 6a of Chapter 6 of the Municipal Utility District Act (California Public Utilities Code Sections 12850 et seq.) and the Revenue Bond Law of 1941 (California Government Code Section 54300 et seq.) for the purpose of financing improvements and additions to the District’s Electric System;

WHEREAS, revenue bonds may be issued pursuant to the provisions of the Master Resolution and California Government Code Section 53580 et seq. for the purpose of refunding revenue bonds, including the District’s commercial paper notes (the “Notes”);

WHEREAS, the District has determined to issue its 2024 Bonds (as defined herein), at one or more times and in one or more series or subseries (as specified in the hereinafter defined Sales Certificates) and in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the principal amount described herein, to (i) to the extent specified in one or more of the Sales Certificates, refund certain series and maturities of the District’s Electric Revenue Bonds (to be identified in one or more of the Sales Certificates) (the “Refunded Bonds”), (ii) to the extent specified in one or more of the Sales Certificates, finance and refinance improvements and additions to the District’s outstanding Notes, (iii) pay costs of issuance (to the extent specified in the Sales Certificates), and (iv) make deposits to the Reserve Fund or a separate debt service reserve fund (as and if specified in one or more of the Sales Certificates);

WHEREAS, the District has drafted proposed amendments to the Master Resolution which are described in Section 148.01 of this Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, and the District intends to issue the 2024 Bonds with the provision that each holder of the 2024 Bonds by purchasing the 2024 Bonds is deemed to have consented to the proposed amendments, all as more fully described herein;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of Sacramento Municipal Utility District, as follows:

ARTICLE CXLVI  
2024 BONDS

Section 146.01 Authorization and Terms of 2024 Bonds.

(a) The Board hereby authorizes the issuance of revenue bonds of the District for the purpose of (i) refunding outstanding revenue bonds of the District, and/or (ii) financing and refinancing improvements and additions to the District’s Electric System, including through the payment of all or a portion of the District’s outstanding Notes, in each case in accordance with the Master Resolution and the Sales Certificates. The authorization provided in this paragraph to issue revenue bonds shall include, in addition to the purposes mentioned above, the authorization to issue such bonds for the allocable portion of any original issue discount, underwriting discount, bond insurance premiums, costs of issuance, deposits to the Reserve Fund or a separate debt service reserve fund, and other miscellaneous costs necessary or desirable, in the judgment of the Treasurer, to be financed by such bonds.

(b) One or more series of bonds to be issued under the Master Resolution are hereby created. Said bonds shall be known as the “Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series [__],” with such letter or other identifying series or subseries designations as are specified in the Sales Certificates (herein collectively called the “2024 Bonds”). The 2024 Bonds may be sold and issued at one or more times and in one or more series or subseries (as specified in the hereinafter defined Sales Certificates) only in fully registered form. The 2024 Bonds shall be initially registered in the name of “Cede & Co.,” as nominee of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) and shall be numbered in consecutive order in such manner as is determined by the Trustee. Registered ownership of the 2024 Bonds, or any portion thereof, may not thereafter be transferred except as set forth in Section 146.08.

(c) The 2024 Bonds shall be issued in such aggregate principal amount (not to exceed $800,000,000), shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates (payable on such dates), not exceeding the maximum rate permitted by law, shall mature and become payable as to principal on such maturity dates in the amounts and subject to such mandatory sinking fund payments on such mandatory sinking fund payment dates, if any, all as set forth in one or more
<!-- Page 15 -->
![Sales Certificates](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Sales+Certificates)

Sales Certificates to be executed and delivered concurrently with the sale of the applicable series or subseries of 2024 Bonds (collectively, the “Sales Certificates”). If all or any portion of the 2024 Bonds are to bear interest at variable rates of interest, not exceeding the maximum rate permitted by law, the manner of determining such variable rates of interest shall be as set forth in the applicable Sales Certificate. In addition to the provisions required pursuant to the terms of this Resolution to be specified in the Sales Certificates, the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager of the District, any Member of the Executive Committee of the District, the Treasurer of the District, the Secretary of the District, or the Chief Financial Officer of the District or the designee of any of them (each an “Authorized Officer”), on behalf of the District, may set forth in the Sales Certificates such provisions, in a form approved by its bond counsel and the District’s counsel, as such Authorized Officer may deem necessary or desirable and consistent with the purpose of this Resolution, including provisions (i) adding additional covenants and agreements to be observed by the District, (ii) curing, correcting, amending or supplementing any ambiguous, defective or ineffective provision contained in the Resolution, or (iii) amending or supplementing any provision contained herein to the extent necessary to obtain one or more bond insurance policies, to obtain a rating on any of the 2024 Bonds, or to provide for the issuance of any of the 2024 Bonds if, in the judgment of any Authorized Officer, after consulting with its municipal advisor, bond counsel and District counsel, such insurance, rating or provision is reasonable. Any Authorized Officer, acting alone, is hereby authorized and instructed to execute and deliver the Sales Certificates and, upon execution and delivery thereof, the Sales Certificates shall be incorporated herein and in the Master Resolution by reference. The execution and delivery of the Sales Certificates shall be conclusive evidence that, where any judgment or determination of reasonableness is required to be made by the person signing said Sales Certificates, such judgment or determination has been made.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Sales Certificate shall specify (i) a true interest cost on the applicable 2024 Bonds bearing interest at fixed rates of interest in excess of 5.50%; or (ii) a maturity date for any 2024 Bond later than forty (40) years after the date dated of such 2024 Bond.

(e) Interest on the 2024 Bonds shall be calculated on the basis and be payable on the dates set forth in the Sales Certificates, to the registered owners thereof as of the record dates specified in the Sales Certificates.

(f) Pursuant to Section 5.04 of the Master Resolution, the Sales Certificates shall specify whether the 2024 Bonds or any series or subseries thereof are to be secured by (A) the Reserve Fund, (B) a separate debt service reserve fund, or (C) neither (A) nor (B). If the Sales Certificates provide that the 2024 Bonds or any series or subseries thereof are to be secured by a separate debt service reserve fund, such Sales Certificates may provide for the creation of such funds or accounts in furtherance thereof as may be deemed appropriate in the Treasurer’s discretion, and such funds or accounts shall be held in trust by the District or the Trustee, as specified in the Sales Certificates, solely for the benefit of the Holders of the 2024 Bonds or applicable series or subseries thereof, and is hereby pledged solely to the payment of the 2024 Bonds or applicable series or subseries thereof, subject to the application thereof for the purposes set forth in the Sales Certificates. If a separate debt service reserve fund is so created, the Sales Certificates may further specify such other terms and provision relating thereto, as in the Treasurer’s discretion are appropriate, including, without implied limitation, the minimum.

(g) The Sales Certificates shall designate the series, amounts and maturity or sinking fund payment dates of the Refunded Bonds.

(a) Notice of Redemption. If any of the 2024 Bonds are subject to redemption, then in addition to the notice of redemption required to be given pursuant to Article IV of the Master Resolution, the Trustee shall mail, by first class mail, postage prepaid, notice of redemption of any 2024 Bond to the Securities Depositories. Failure of the Trustee to give notice of redemption to any Securities Depository, or any defect therein, however, shall not affect the sufficiency of the proceedings of redemption with respect to any 2024 Bond. For purposes of this paragraph, the following term shall have the following meaning:

“Securities Depositories” means DTC, 55 Water Street, 50th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10041-0099 Attn. Call Notification Department, Fax (212) 855-7232; or, in accordance with the current guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to such other address and/or such other securities depositories as the District may designate to the Trustee in writing.

(b) Redemption Otherwise Subject to Article IV. Except as in this Section and in the Sales Certificates otherwise provided, the redemption of 2024 Bonds shall be subject to the provisions of Article IV of the Master Resolution.

Section 146.03 Deposits to Interest Fund and Principal Account. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Resolution, the Treasurer, out of Net Revenues received by the District, shall set aside in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, such amounts as may be required so that an amount equal to the amount of principal and/or interest becoming due and payable on the 2024 Bonds on each interest payment date and principal payment date is on deposit in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account.

**Section 146.04 2024 Sinking Fund.**

(a) An account is hereby established within the Sinking Fund created by Section 5.02 of the Master Resolution to be designated the “2024 Sinking Fund.” On or before each minimum sinking fund payment date for any 2024 Bonds set forth in the Sales Certificates, the Treasurer shall deposit in the 2024 Sinking Fund, out of Net Revenues received by the District, such amounts as may be required to cause the balance therein to be equal to the amount of the minimum sinking fund payment due and payable on the 2024 Bonds on such minimum sinking fund payment date as set forth in the Sales Certificates.

(b) The District shall apply all such minimum sinking fund payments, as rapidly as practicable, to the purchase of 2024 Bonds at public or private sale, as and when and at such prices (including brokerage and other expenses, but excluding accrued interest, which is payable from the Interest Fund) as the District may in its discretion determine.

(c) If on the first day of the month preceding the month in which a minimum sinking fund payment date occurs, as set forth in the Sales Certificates, the moneys in the 2024 Sinking Fund equal or exceed $25,000, such moneys shall be applied by the District to the redemption on such minimum sinking fund payment date of as many 2024 Bonds as such moneys in the 2024 Sinking Fund shall suffice to redeem at a redemption price equal to the principal amount thereof (except that accrued interest on such 2024 Bonds so called for redemption shall be paid from the Interest Fund). All 2024 Bonds purchased or redeemed under the provisions of this Section shall be delivered to, and canceled by, the Trustee and shall not be reissued.

(d) No application of any moneys to the retirement of 2024 Bonds shall operate to impair or affect the obligation of the District to make minimum sinking fund payments for 2024 Bonds in the amounts and at the times provided in this Section; however, the District shall not be deemed to be in default with respect to any 2024 Bonds minimum sinking fund payment for any minimum sinking fund payment date if at all times prior to such minimum sinking fund payment date the District shall have fixed rates and charges as required by Section 6.08 of the Master Resolution, and if at such minimum sinking fund payment date the aggregate principal amount of all 2024 Bonds theretofore purchased or redeemed through the operation of the 2024 Sinking Fund or otherwise (together with any moneys then in the 2024 Sinking Fund) equals or exceeds the aggregate amount of minimum sinking fund payments for 2024 Bonds then and theretofore required to be made pursuant to this Section.

(e) Any moneys remaining in the 2024 Sinking Fund after all 2024 Bonds have been retired shall be returned to the District for any lawful District use.

depository”); provided that any successor of DTC or substitute depository shall be qualified under any applicable laws to provide the service proposed to be provided by it;

(ii) To any substitute depository not objected to by the Trustee, upon (1) the resignation of DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository or (2) a determination by the District that DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) is no longer able to carry out its functions as depository; provided that any such substitute depository shall be qualified under any applicable laws to provide the services proposed to be provided by it; or

(iii) To any person as provided below, upon (1) the resignation of DTC or its successor (or substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository; provided that no substitute depository which is not objected to by the Trustee can be obtained or (2) a determination by the District that it is in the best interests of the District to remove DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository.

(b) In the case of any transfer pursuant to clause (i) or clause (ii) of Section 140.08(a) hereof, upon receipt of all outstanding 2024 Bonds by the Trustee, together with a Certificate of the District to the Trustee, a single new 2024 Bond shall be executed and delivered for each maturity of each series of 2024 Bonds then outstanding registered in the name of such successor or such substitute depository, or their nominees, as the case may be, all as specified in such Certificate of the District. In the case of any transfer pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 146.08(a) hereof, upon receipt of all outstanding 2024 Bonds by the Trustee together with a Certificate of the District to the Trustee, new 2024 Bonds shall be executed, authenticated and delivered in such denominations and registered in the names of such persons as are requested in such a Certificate of the District, subject to the limitations of Section 146.08(a) hereof, provided the Trustee shall not be required to deliver such new 2024 Bonds within a period less than 60 days from the date of receipt of such a Certificate of the District. Subsequent to any transfer pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 146.08(a) hereof, the 2024 Bonds shall be transferred as provided in Article II of the Master Resolution.

(c) In the case of partial redemption or refunding of the 2024 Bonds of a series evidencing all or a portion of the principal maturing in a particular year, DTC shall make an appropriate notation on such 2024 Bonds indicating the date and amounts of such reduction in principal. The Trustee shall incur no liability for the failure or any error by DTC in making such notation and the records of the Trustee shall be determinative of the outstanding principal amount of 2024 Bonds.

(d) The District and the Trustee shall be entitled to treat the person in whose name any 2024 Bond is registered as the Bondholder thereof for all purposes of the Master Resolution and any applicable laws, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary received by the Trustee or the District; and the District and the Trustee shall have no responsibility for transmitting payments to, communicating with, notifying, or otherwise dealing with, any beneficial owners of the 2024 Bonds.

including DTC or its successor (or substitute depository or its successor), except for the holder of any 2024 Bond.

(e) So long as the outstanding 2024 Bonds are registered in the name of Cede & Co. or its registered assigns, the District and the Trustee (to the extent funds are provided to it by the District) shall cooperate with Cede & Co., as sole registered Bondholder, and its registered assigns, in effecting payment of the principal of and redemption premium, if any, and interest on the 2024 Bonds by arranging for payment in such manner that funds for such payments are properly identified and are made immediately available on the date they are due.

Section 146.09 Tax Covenants.

(a) The District shall at all times do and perform all acts and things permitted by law which are necessary or desirable in order to assure that interest paid on the 2024 Bonds (or any of them) will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and shall take no action that would result in such interest not being excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the District agrees to comply with the provisions of each Tax Certificate of the District, dated the date of issuance of the applicable 2024 Bonds, as amended from time to time in accordance with its terms (collectively, the “Tax Certificate”). This covenant shall survive payment in full or defeasance of the 2024 Bonds.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the District agrees that there shall be paid from time to time all amounts required to be rebated to the United States of America pursuant to Section 148(f) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and any temporary, proposed or final United States Treasury Regulations as may be applicable to the 2024 Bonds from time to time (the “Rebate Requirement”). The District specifically covenants to pay or cause to be paid the Rebate Requirement as provided in the Tax Certificate to the United States of America from any Net Revenues lawfully available to the District. This covenant shall survive payment in full or defeasance of the 2024 Bonds. Capitalized terms in this Section not otherwise defined in the Master Resolution or this Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Tax Certificate.

(c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section, if the District shall obtain an opinion of counsel of recognized national standing in the field of obligations the interest on which is excluded from gross income for purposes of federal income taxation to the effect that any specified action required under this Section is no longer required, or to the effect that some different action is required, to maintain the exclusion from gross income of the interest on the 2024 Bonds under Section 103 of the Code, the District may rely conclusively on such opinion in complying with the provisions hereof, and the agreements and covenants hereunder shall be deemed to be modified to that extent without the necessity of an amendment of the Master Resolution or this Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution or the consent at any time of the Bondholders.

(d) This Section 146.09 shall be inapplicable to the 2024 Bonds, if any, issued bearing interest included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, as set forth in the applicable Sales Certificate.

Bond is issued pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Directors of the District, adopted January 7, 1971, providing for the issuance of the Bonds, as amended and supplemented (the “Resolution”), including as amended and supplemented by a Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, adopted March 21, 2024, authorizing the issuance of the 2024 Series [__] Bonds. Reference is hereby made to the Resolution and the Act for a description of the terms on which the Bonds are issued and to be issued, the provisions with regard to the nature and extent of the Revenues, as that term is defined in the Resolution, and the rights of the registered owners of the Bonds; and all the terms of the Resolution and the Act are hereby incorporated herein and constitute a contract between the District and the registered owner from time to time of this Bond, and to all the provisions thereof the registered owner of this Bond, by its acceptance hereof, consents and agrees. Additional bonds may be issued on a parity with the Bonds of this authorized issue, but only subject to the conditions and limitations contained in the Resolution.

The Bonds and the interest thereon (to the extent set forth in the Resolution), together with the Parity Bonds (as defined in the Resolution) heretofore or hereafter issued by the District, and the interest thereon, are payable from, and are secured by a charge and lien on, the Net Revenues derived by the District from the Electric System (as those terms are defined in the Resolution). The District hereby covenants and warrants that for the payment of the Bonds and interest thereon, there have been created and will be maintained by the District special funds into which there shall be deposited from Net Revenues available for that purpose sums sufficient to pay the principal of, and interest on, all of the Bonds, as such principal and interest become due, and as an irrevocable charge the District has allocated Net Revenues to such payment, all in accordance with the Resolution.

The Bonds are special obligations of the District, and are payable, both as to principal and interest, out of the Net Revenues pertaining to the Electric System, and not out of any other fund or moneys of the District. No holder of this Bond shall ever have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the District to pay this Bond or the interest hereon.

[The 2024 Series [__] Bonds are not subject to redemption.] Redemption Terms to be Determined at Time of Sale and Conformed to the applicable Official Statement and applicable Sales Certificate.

This Bond is transferable by the registered owner hereof, in person or by the attorney of such owner duly authorized in writing, at the designated corporate trust office of the Trustee but only in the manner, subject to the limitations and upon payment of the charges provided in the Resolution, and upon surrender and cancellation of this Bond. Upon such transfer a new fully registered Bond or Bonds without coupons, of authorized denomination or denominations, for the same aggregate principal amount and maturity will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor. No transfer of this Bond will be made during the 15 days next preceding each interest payment date.

The District, the Trustee and any paying agent may deem and treat the registered owner hereof as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, and the District, the Trustee and any paying agent shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

then to be performed and all conditions then to be satisfied by the District in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Resolution and the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement.

If any of the conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Contract of Purchase with respect to the Bonds shall not have been satisfied when and as required herein, all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder with respect to the Bonds may be terminated by the Underwriters at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by written notice to the District.

4. Offering. The obligations of the District to sell and to deliver the Bonds on the Closing Date to the Underwriters shall be subject to the following conditions:

(a) The entire [$PAR] aggregate principal amount of the Bonds shall be purchased, accepted and paid for by the Underwriters on the Closing Date; and

(b) The District shall receive an Issue Price Certificate of the Senior Underwriter substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F with respect to the Bonds.

5. Issue Price of the Bonds. The Senior Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, agrees to assist the District in establishing the issue price of the Bonds and shall execute and deliver to the District at Closing an “issue price” or similar certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F, together with the supporting pricing wires or equivalent communications, with modifications to such certificate as may be deemed appropriate or necessary, in the reasonable judgment of the Senior Underwriter, the District and Bond Counsel, to accurately reflect, as applicable, the sales price or prices or the initial offering price or prices to the public of the Bonds.

(b) [Except for the maturities set forth in Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto,] the District will treat the first price at which 10% of each maturity of the Bonds (the “10% test”) is sold to the public as the issue price of that maturity (if different interest rates apply within a maturity, each separate CUSIP number within that maturity will be subject to the 10% test).

(c) [The Senior Underwriter confirms that the Underwriters have offered the Bonds to the public on or before the date of this Contract of Purchase at the offering price or prices (the “initial offering price”), or at the corresponding yield or yields, set forth in Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto. Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto sets forth, as of the date of this Contract of Purchase, the maturities, if any, of the Bonds for which the 10% test has not been satisfied and for which the District and the Senior Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, agree that the restrictions set forth in the next sentence shall apply, which will allow the District to treat the initial offering price to the public of each such maturity as of the sale date as the issue price of that maturity (the “hold-the-offering-price rule”). So long as the hold-the-offering-price rule remains applicable to any maturity of the Bonds, the Senior Underwriter will neither offer nor sell unsold Bonds of that maturity to any person at a price that is higher than the initial offering price to the public during the period starting on the sale date and ending on the earlier of the following:

(1) the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date; or

11  
4859-9712-9641.3
<!-- Page 48 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image) 

(2) the date on which the Underwriters have sold at least 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public.

The Senior Underwriter shall promptly advise the District or the District’s municipal advisor when the Underwriters have sold 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public, if that occurs prior to the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date.

The District acknowledges that, in making the representation set forth in this subsection, the Senior Underwriter will rely on (i) the agreement of each Underwriter to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in an agreement among underwriters and the related pricing wires, (ii) in the event a selling group has been created in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each dealer who is a member of the selling group to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in a selling group agreement and the related pricing wires, and (iii) in the event that an Underwriter is a party to a retail distribution agreement that was employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each broker-dealer that is a party to such agreement to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in the retail distribution agreement and the related pricing wires. The District further acknowledges that each Underwriter shall be solely liable for its failure to comply with its agreement regarding the hold the offering price rule and that no Underwriter shall be liable for the failure of any other Underwriter, or of any dealer who is a member of a selling group, or of any broker-dealer that is a party to a retail distribution agreement to comply with its agreement regarding the hold-the-offering-price rule as applicable to the Bonds.

(d) [The Senior Underwriter confirms that:

(1) any agreement among underwriters, any selling group agreement and each retail distribution agreement (to which the Senior Underwriter is a party) relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each Underwriter, each dealer who is a member of the selling group, and each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement, as applicable, to (A)(i) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the Senior Underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public and (ii) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, in each case if and for so long as directed by the Senior Underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires, (B) promptly notify the Senior Underwriter of any sales of the Bonds that, to its knowledge, are made to a purchaser who is a related party to an underwriter participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (each such term being used as defined below) and (C) acknowledge that, unless otherwise advised by the Underwriter, dealer or broker-dealer, the Senior Underwriter shall assume that each order submitted by the Underwriter, dealer or broker-dealer is a sale to the public; and

12  
4859-9712-9641.3
<!-- Page 49 -->
(2) any agreement among underwriters relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each Underwriter that is a party to a retail distribution agreement to be employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public to require each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement to (A) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the Senior Underwriter or the Underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public and (B) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, in each case if and for so long as directed by the Senior Underwriter or the Underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires.]

(e) The Underwriters acknowledge that sales of any Bonds to any person that is a related party to an Underwriter shall not constitute sales to the public for purposes of this section. Further, for purposes of this section:

(1) “public” means any person other than an underwriter or a related party,

(2) “underwriter” means (A) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the District (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public and (B) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a related party described in clause (A) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public),

(3) a purchaser of any of the Bonds is a “related party” to an underwriter if the underwriter and the purchaser are subject, directly or indirectly, to (i) more than 50% common ownership of the voting power or the total value of their stock, if both entities are corporations (including direct ownership by one corporation of another), (ii) more than 50% common ownership of their capital interests or profits interests, if both entities are partnerships (including direct ownership by one partnership of another), or (iii) more than 50% common ownership of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation or the capital interests or profit interests of the partnership, as applicable, if one entity is a corporation and the other entity is a partnership (including direct ownership of the applicable stock or interests by one entity of the other), and

(4) “sale date” means the date of execution of this Contract of Purchase by all parties.

6. Termination. The Underwriters shall have the right to terminate their obligations under this Contract of Purchase to purchase, accept delivery of and to pay for the Bonds, if,
<!-- Page 50 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
(a) between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the market price or marketability, or the ability of the Underwriters to enforce contracts for the sale, at the initial offering prices set forth in the Official Statement, of the Bonds have been materially adversely affected, in the judgment of the Underwriters, (evidenced by a written notice to the District terminating the obligation of the Underwriters to accept delivery of and pay for the Bonds), by reason of any of the following:

(1) (x) any legislation which is (A) enacted by Congress, (B) favorably reported for passage to either House of the Congress of the United States by any Committee of such House to which such legislation has been referred for consideration, or (C) recommended to the Congress for passage by the President of the United States or the Treasury Department, but only, however, if the occurrence of any of the foregoing events is generally accepted by the municipal bond market as potentially affecting the federal tax status of the District, its property or income or the interest on its bonds or notes (including the Bonds), (y) any decision rendered by a court established under Article III of the Constitution of the United States, or (z) a final order, ruling, regulation or official statement issued or made by or on behalf of the Treasury Department of the United States or the Internal Revenue Service with the purpose or effect, directly or indirectly, of imposing federal income taxation upon such interest as would be received by the holders of the Bonds, or upon such revenues or other income of the general character expected to be received by the District; provided, however, that the enactment of legislation which only diminishes the value of, as opposed to eliminating the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes will not give the Underwriters the right to terminate their obligations hereunder;

(2) Legislation enacted (or resolution passed) by the Congress or a final order, ruling, regulation or official statement is issued or made by or on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other governmental agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter, to the effect that obligations of the general character of the Bonds are not exempt from registration under other requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or are not exempt from qualification under, or other requirements of, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or that the issuance, offering or sale of the Bonds or obligations of the general character of the Bonds, including any or all underlying arrangements, as contemplated hereby or by the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement, otherwise is or would be in violation of the federal securities laws as amended and then in effect;

(3) Any new material outbreak or escalation of hostilities having a material effect on the financial markets of the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence of any other local, national or international calamity, crisis or event relating to the effective operation of the government of or the financial community in the United States or an escalation thereof, including, without limitation, a downgrade of the sovereign debt rating of the United States by any major credit rating agency or payment default on United States Treasury obligations;  
14  
4859-9712-9641.3  
<!-- Page 51 -->
(4) the declaration of a general banking moratorium by federal, New York or California authorities, or the general suspension of trading on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange, or any material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or payment services or clearing services;

(5) the imposition by the New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange, or any governmental authority, of any material restrictions not now in force with respect to the Bonds or obligations of the general character of the Bonds or securities generally, or the material increase of any such restrictions now in force, including those relating to the net capital requirements of the Underwriters;

(6) the adoption of any amendment to the federal or California Constitution, decision by any federal or California court, or enactment by any federal or California legislative body materially adversely affecting (i) the District or the right of the District to receive or to pledge any of the Net Revenues, or (ii) the validity or enforceability of this Contract of Purchase, the Bonds or the Resolution;

(7) the adoption of any amendment to the California Constitution, decision by any California court, or enactment by any California legislative body adversely affecting the exemption of state or local income tax upon such interest as would be received by the holders of the Bonds, or

(8) (i) a downgrading or suspension of any rating (without regard to credit enhancement) by Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch of any debt securities issued by the District, or (ii) there shall have been any official statement as to a possible downgrading (such as being placed on “credit watch” or “negative outlook” or any similar qualification) of any rating by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch of any debt securities issued by the District, including the Bonds.

(b) an event occurs, or information becomes known, which, in the judgment of the Underwriters, makes untrue in any material respect any statement or information contained in the Official Statement, or has the effect that the Official Statement contains any untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

**Selection of Bonds for Redemption.** If less than all of a maturity of the Bonds is to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed, from the Outstanding Bonds of such maturity not previously called for redemption, by lot in any manner the Trustee deems fair.

**Notice of Redemption.** Notice of redemption for the Bonds will be given by publication at least once in financial newspapers or journals, selected by the Trustee, of general circulation in San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, each such publication to be not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption, if at any time the Bonds are not in book entry form. Notice also will be mailed to the registered owners of any Bonds designated for redemption, but failure to mail such notice or any defect therein with respect to any particular Bond will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Bonds. For so long as the book-entry-only system is in effect with respect to the Bonds, the Trustee will mail notice of redemption solely to DTC or its nominee or its successor. Any failure of DTC or its successor, or of a direct or indirect DTC participant, to notify a beneficial owner of a Bond of any redemption will not affect the sufficiency or validity of the redemption of any Bond. The District may instruct the Trustee to give conditional notice of optional redemption, which may be conditioned upon the receipt of moneys or any other event.

[**TO BE UPDATED**]

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC  
[________]  
[________]  

Re: Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
$[PAR] Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Paragraph 3(d)(6) of the Contract of Purchase (the “Contract of Purchase”), dated [SALE DATE], between J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as Senior Managing Underwriter named therein (the “Senior Underwriter”), and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (the “District”) relating to the above-captioned bonds (the “Bonds”).

As counsel to the District, I have reviewed (i) Resolution No. 6649 of the District, adopted on January 7, 1971, as amended and supplemented to date, including as amended and supplemented by Resolution No. [RESO NO.], adopted on March 21, 2024 (as so amended and supplemented, the “Resolution”); (ii) the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Undertaking”), between the District and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”); (iii) the Preliminary Official Statement of the District, dated [POS DATE] (the “Preliminary Official Statement”); (iv) the Official Statement of the District, dated [SALE DATE] (the “Official Statement”) and (v) such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent I deemed necessary to provide the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. I have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to me (whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery by, and validity against, any parties other than the District. I have not undertaken to verify independently, and have assumed, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents referred to in the second paragraph hereof. I have further assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in such documents.

I call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Resolution, the Undertaking, and the Contract of Purchase may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or  

C-1  
4859-9712-9641.3  
<!-- Page 59 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against municipal utility districts in the State of California. I express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, choice of law, choice of forum or waiver provisions contained therein.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, I am of the opinion that:

1. The District is a political subdivision of the State of California duly organized and validly existing under the Act, as amended, and has full legal right, power and authority to execute and deliver (or adopt, as the case may be), and to perform its obligations under, the Resolution, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase.

2. The Contract of Purchase and the Undertaking have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the District, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the parties thereto other than the District, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the District, enforceable against the District in accordance with their respective terms.

3. The District is not in breach of or default under any existing constitutional provision, applicable law or administrative regulation of the State of California or the United States or any applicable judgment or decree or any loan agreement, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument known to me after reasonable inquiry to which the District is a party or to which the District or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District, and no event has occurred and is continuing which with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default or event of default under any such instrument which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District; and the execution and delivery of the Bonds, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase and the adoption of the Resolution, and compliance with any existing constitutional provision, law, administrative regulation, judgment, decree, loan agreement, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument known to me after reasonable inquiry to which the District is a party or to which the District or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject will not, as of the date hereof, conflict with or constitute a breach of or default under any such instrument which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District, nor will any such execution, delivery, adoption or compliance result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or other security interest or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of the property or assets of the District or under the terms of any such law, regulation or instrument, except as expressly provided by the Bonds and the Resolution.

4. The statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement which purport to describe certain provisions of the Bonds, the Undertaking, and the Resolution present a fair and accurate summary of such provisions for the purpose of use in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement.

5. Except as described or referred to in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement, as of the date hereof, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or

investigation, at law or in equity, before or by any court, government agency, public board or body, pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened against the District affecting the corporate existence of the District or the titles of its officers to their respective offices, or affecting or seeking to prohibit, restrain or enjoin the sale, issuance or delivery of the Bonds or the collection of the Revenues (as defined in the Resolution) or the Net Revenues (as defined in the Resolution) pledged or to be pledged to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds or contesting or affecting as to the District the validity or enforceability of the Act, the Bonds, the Resolution, the Contract of Purchase or the Undertaking, or contesting the tax exempt status of interest on the Bonds, or which may result in any material adverse change relating to the District, other than routine litigation of the type which normally accompanies its operation of its generation, transmission and distribution facilities, or contesting the completeness or accuracy of the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement or any supplement or amendment thereto, or contesting the powers of the District or any authority for the issuance of the Bonds, the adoption of the Resolution, or the execution and delivery by the District of the Contract of Purchase, or the Undertaking, nor, to the best of my knowledge, is there any basis for any such action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Act or the authorization, execution, delivery or performance by the District of the Bonds, the Resolution, the Undertaking, or the Contract of Purchase.

6. Based upon my review of the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement as General Counsel to the District and without having undertaken to determine independently the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement (except as specifically set forth in paragraph 4 hereof), I have no reason to believe that the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement (except for information relating Cede & Co., DTC or the operation of the book-entry system, the Appendices (except Appendix A) to the Preliminary Official Statement, and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to all of which I express no view) as of its date and as of the date of the Contract of Purchase contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and the Official Statement (except for information relating Cede & Co., DTC or the operation of the book-entry system, the Appendices (except Appendix A) to the Official Statement, and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to all of which I express no view) (A) as of the date of the Official Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (B) as of the date hereof contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

For purposes of the opinions expressed herein, I have assumed that an agreement or other document is “material” to the District if it involves amounts in excess of $10,000,000 and that a matter would result in a “material adverse change” to the District if the financial consequences involved would exceed $10,000,000.

I understand that you are relying upon the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel, with respect to the validity of the Bonds and the exclusion of interest on the

C-3  
4859-9712-9641.3

Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes and the Bonds for purposes of State of California income taxation and, accordingly, render no opinion with respect thereto.

Very truly yours,

(16) Such additional legal opinions, certificates, instruments and other documents as the Underwriters may reasonably request to evidence the truth and accuracy and completeness, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, of the District’s representations and warranties contained herein and of the statements and information contained in the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement, and the due performance or satisfaction by the District at or prior to the Closing Date of all agreements then to be performed and all conditions then to be satisfied by the District in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Resolution and the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement.

If any of the conditions to the obligations of the Underwriters contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Contract of Purchase with respect to the Bonds shall not have been satisfied when and as required herein, all obligations of the Underwriters hereunder with respect to the Bonds may be terminated by the Underwriters at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date by written notice to the District.

4. Offering. The obligations of the District to sell and to deliver the Bonds on the Closing Date to the Underwriters shall be subject to the following conditions:

(a) The entire $[PAR] aggregate principal amount of the Bonds shall be purchased, accepted and paid for by the Underwriters on the Closing Date; and

(b) The District shall receive an Issue Price Certificate of the Senior Underwriter substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F with respect to the Bonds.

5. Issue Price of the Bonds. The Senior Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, agrees to assist the District in establishing the issue price of the Bonds and shall execute and deliver to the District at Closing an “issue price” or similar certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F, together with the supporting pricing wires or equivalent communications, with modifications to such certificate as may be deemed appropriate or necessary, in the reasonable judgment of the Senior Underwriter, the District and Bond Counsel, to accurately reflect, as applicable, the sales price or prices or the initial offering price or prices to the public of the Bonds.

(b) [Except for the maturities set forth in Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto,] the District will treat the first price at which 10% of each maturity of the Bonds (the “10% test”) is sold to the public as the issue price of that maturity (if different interest rates apply within a maturity, each separate CUSIP number within that maturity will be subject to the 10% test).

(c) [The Senior Underwriter confirms that the Underwriters have offered the Bonds to the public on or before the date of this Contract of Purchase at the offering price or prices (the “initial offering price”), or at the corresponding yield or yields, set forth in Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto. Schedule A of Exhibit F attached hereto sets forth, as of the date of this Contract of Purchase, the maturities, if any, of the Bonds for which the 10% test has not been satisfied and

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
for which the District and the Senior Underwriter, on behalf of the Underwriters, agree that the restrictions set forth in the next sentence shall apply, which will allow the District to treat the initial offering price to the public of each such maturity as of the sale date as the issue price of that maturity (the “hold-the-offering-price rule”). So long as the hold-the-offering-price rule remains applicable to any maturity of the Bonds, the Senior Underwriter will neither offer nor sell unsold Bonds of that maturity to any person at a price that is higher than the initial offering price to the public during the period starting on the sale date and ending on the earlier of the following:

(1) the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date; or

(2) the date on which the Underwriters have sold at least 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public.

The Senior Underwriter shall promptly advise the District or the District’s municipal advisor when the Underwriters have sold 10% of that maturity of the Bonds to the public at a price that is no higher than the initial offering price to the public, if that occurs prior to the close of the fifth (5th) business day after the sale date.

The District acknowledges that, in making the representation set forth in this subsection, the Senior Underwriter will rely on (i) the agreement of each Underwriter to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in an agreement among underwriters and the related pricing wires, (ii) in the event a selling group has been created in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each dealer who is a member of the selling group to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in a selling group agreement and the related pricing wires, and (iii) in the event that an Underwriter is a party to a retail distribution agreement that was employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, the agreement of each broker-dealer that is a party to such agreement to comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, as set forth in the retail distribution agreement and the related pricing wires. The District further acknowledges that each Underwriter shall be solely liable for its failure to comply with its agreement regarding the hold the offering price rule and that no Underwriter shall be liable for the failure of any other Underwriter, or of any dealer who is a member of a selling group, or of any broker-dealer that is a party to a retail distribution agreement to comply with its agreement regarding the hold-the-offering-price rule as applicable to the Bonds.]

(d) [The Senior Underwriter confirms that:

(1) any agreement among underwriters, any selling group agreement and each retail distribution agreement (to which the Senior Underwriter is a party) relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each Underwriter, each dealer who is a member of the selling group, and each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement, as applicable, to (A)(i) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the Senior Underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public and (ii) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, in each case if and for**

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
so long as directed by the Senior Underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires, (B) promptly notify the Senior Underwriter of any sales of the Bonds that, to its knowledge, are made to a purchaser who is a related party to an underwriter participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (each such term being used as defined below) and (C) acknowledge that, unless otherwise advised by the Underwriter, dealer or broker-dealer, the Senior Underwriter shall assume that each order submitted by the Underwriter, dealer or broker-dealer is a sale to the public; and

(2) any agreement among underwriters relating to the initial sale of the Bonds to the public, together with the related pricing wires, contains or will contain language obligating each Underwriter that is a party to a retail distribution agreement to be employed in connection with the initial sale of the Bonds to the public to require each broker-dealer that is a party to such retail distribution agreement to (A) report the prices at which it sells to the public the unsold Bonds of each maturity allotted to it until it is notified by the Senior Underwriter or the Underwriter that either the 10% test has been satisfied as to the Bonds of that maturity or all Bonds of that maturity have been sold to the public and (B) comply with the hold-the-offering-price rule, if applicable, in each case if and for so long as directed by the Senior Underwriter or the Underwriter and as set forth in the related pricing wires.

(e) The Underwriters acknowledge that sales of any Bonds to any person that is a related party to an Underwriter shall not constitute sales to the public for purposes of this section. Further, for purposes of this section:

(1) “public” means any person other than an underwriter or a related party;

(2) “underwriter” means (A) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract with the District (or with the lead underwriter to form an underwriting syndicate) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public and (B) any person that agrees pursuant to a written contract directly or indirectly with a person described in clause (A) to participate in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public (including a member of a selling group or a party to a retail distribution agreement participating in the initial sale of the Bonds to the public);

(3) a purchaser of any of the Bonds is a “related party” to an underwriter if the underwriter and the purchaser are subject, directly or indirectly, to (i) more than 50% common ownership of the voting power or the total value of its stock, if both entities are corporations (including direct ownership by one corporation of another), (ii) more than 50% common ownership of their capital interests or profits interests, if both entities are partnerships (including direct ownership by one partnership of another), or (iii) more than 50% common ownership of the value of the outstanding stock of the corporation or the capital interests or profit interests of the partnership, as applicable, if one entity is a corporation and the other entity is a partnership (including direct ownership of the applicable stock or interests by one entity of the other), and

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
(4) “sale date” means the date of execution of this Contract of Purchase by all parties.  

6. Termination. The Underwriters shall have the right to terminate their obligations under this Contract of Purchase to purchase, accept delivery of and to pay for the Bonds, if,  

(a) between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the market price or marketability, or the ability of the Underwriters to enforce contracts for the sale, at the initial offering prices set forth in the Official Statement, of the Bonds have been materially adversely affected, in the judgment of the Underwriters, (evidenced by a written notice to the District terminating the obligation of the Underwriters to accept delivery of and pay for the Bonds), by reason of any of the following:  

(1) (x) any legislation which is (A) enacted by Congress, (B) favorably reported for passage to either House of the Congress of the United States by any Committee of such House to which such legislation has been referred for consideration, or (C) recommended to the Congress for passage by the President of the United States or the Treasury Department, but only, however, if the occurrence of any of the foregoing events is generally accepted by the municipal bond market as potentially affecting the federal tax status of the District, its property or income or the interest on its bonds or notes (including the Bonds), (y) any decision rendered by a court established under Article III of the Constitution of the United States or the Tax Court of the United States, or (z) a final order, ruling, regulation or official statement issued or made by or on behalf of the Treasury Department of the United States or the Internal Revenue Service with the purpose or effect, directly or indirectly, of imposing federal income taxation upon such interest as would be received by the holders of the Bonds, or upon such revenues or other income of the general character expected to be received by the District; provided, however, that the enactment of legislation which only diminishes the value of, as opposed to eliminating the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes will not give the Underwriters the right to terminate their obligations hereunder;  

(2) Legislation enacted (or resolution passed) by the Congress or a final order, ruling, regulation or official statement is issued or made by or on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other governmental agency having jurisdiction of the subject matter, to the effect that obligations of the general character of the Bonds are not exempt from registration under or other requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or are not exempt from qualification under, or other requirements of, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or that the issuance, offering or sale of the Bonds or obligations of the general character of the Bonds, including any or all underlying arrangements, as contemplated hereby or by the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement, otherwise is or would be in violation of the federal securities laws as amended and then in effect;  

14  
4870-5972-9833.3  
<!-- Page 88 -->
(3) Any new material outbreak or escalation of hostilities having a material effect on the financial markets of the United States or the declaration by the United States of a national emergency or war or the occurrence of any other local, national or international calamity, crisis or event relating to the effective operation of the government of or the financial community in the United States or an escalation thereof, including, without limitation, a downgrade of the sovereign debt rating of the United States by any major credit rating agency or payment default on United States Treasury obligations;

(4) the declaration of a general banking moratorium by federal, New York or California authorities, or the general suspension of trading on the New York Stock Exchange or any other national securities exchange, or any material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlement or payment services or clearing services;

(5) the imposition by the New York Stock Exchange or other national securities exchange, or any governmental authority, of any material restrictions not now in force with respect to the Bonds or obligations of the general character of the Bonds or securities generally, or the material increase of any such restrictions now in force, including those relating to the net capital requirements of the Underwriters;

(6) the adoption of any amendment to the federal or California Constitution, decision by any federal or California court, or enactment by any federal or California legislative body materially adversely affecting (i) the District or the District to receive or to pledge any of the Net Revenues, or (ii) the validity or enforceability of this Contract of Purchase, the Bonds or the Resolution;

(7) the adoption of any amendment to the California Constitution, decision by any California court, or enactment by any California legislative body adversely affecting the exemption of state or local income tax upon such interest as would be received by the holders of the Bonds, or

(8) (i) a downgrading or suspension of any rating (without regard to credit enhancement) by Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch of any debt securities issued by the District, or (ii) there shall have been any official statement as to a possible downgrading (such as being placed on “credit watch” or “negative outlook” or any similar qualification) of any rating by Moody’s, S&P or Fitch of any debt securities issued by the District, including the Bonds.

(b) an event occurs, or information becomes known, which, in the judgment of the Underwriters, makes untrue in any material respect any statement or information contained in the Official Statement, or has the effect that the Official Statement contains any untrue statement of material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

For so long as the book-entry only system is in effect with respect to the Bonds, DTC shall select the Bonds to be redeemed in accordance with the procedures of DTC.

*(Opinion of General Counsel to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District)*

[**CLOSING DATE**]  
[**TO BE UPDATED**]  

BofA Securities, Inc.  
315 Montgomery Street, 1st Floor  
San Francisco, CA 94104  

Re: Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
$[PAR] Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2024 Series N  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is being delivered pursuant to Paragraph 3(d)(6) of the Contract of Purchase (the “Contract of Purchase”), dated [SALE DATE], between BofA Securities, Inc., as Senior Managing Underwriter named therein (the “Senior Underwriter”), and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (the “District”) relating to the above-captioned bonds (the “Bonds”).

As counsel to the District, I have reviewed (i) Resolution No. 6649 of the District, adopted on January 7, 1971, as amended and supplemented to date, including as amended and supplemented by Resolution No. [RESO NO.], adopted on March 21, 2024 (as amended and supplemented, the “Resolution”); (ii) the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Undertaking”), between the District and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”); (iii) the Preliminary Official Statement of the District, dated [POS DATE] (the “Preliminary Official Statement”); (iv) the Official Statement of the District, dated [SALE DATE] (the “Official Statement”); (v) the escrow agreement, dated the date hereof (the “Escrow Agreement”), between the District and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as escrow agent (in such capacity, the “Escrow Agent”), and (vi) such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent I deemed necessary to provide the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by authorities. I have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to me (whether as originals or as copies) and the due and legal execution and delivery by, and validity against, any parties other than the District. I have not undertaken to verify independently, and have assumed, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents referred to in the second paragraph hereof. I have further assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in such documents.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

I call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the Resolution, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking, and the Contract of Purchase may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights, to the application of equitable principles, and to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against municipal utility districts in the State of California. I express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, choice of law, choice of forum or waiver provisions contained therein.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, I am of the opinion that:

1. The District is a political subdivision of the State of California duly organized and validly existing under the Act, as amended, and has full legal right, power and authority to execute and deliver (or adopt, as the case may be), and to perform its obligations under, the Resolution, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase.

2. The Contract of Purchase, the Escrow Agreement, and the Undertaking have been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the District, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each of the parties thereto other than the District, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the District, enforceable against the District in accordance with their respective terms.

3. The District is not in breach of or default under any existing constitutional provision, applicable law or administrative regulation of the State of California or the United States or any applicable judgment or decree or any loan agreement, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument known to me after reasonable inquiry to which the District is a party or to which the District or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District, and no event has occurred and is continuing which with the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default or event of default under any such instrument which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District; and the execution and delivery of the Bonds, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase and the adoption of the Resolution, and compliance with any existing constitutional provision, law, administrative regulation, judgment, decree, loan agreement, indenture, bond, note, resolution, agreement or other instrument known to me after reasonable inquiry to which the District is a party or to which the District or any of its property or assets is otherwise subject will not, as of the date hereof, conflict with or constitute a breach of or default under any such instrument which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or operations of the District, nor will any such execution, delivery, adoption or compliance result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or other security interest or encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any of the property or assets of the District or under the terms of any such law, regulation or instrument, except as expressly provided by the Bonds and the Resolution.

4. The statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement which purport to describe certain provisions of the Bonds, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking and the Contract of Purchase are accurate in all material respects.

Except as described or referred to in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement, as of the date hereof, there is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation, at law or in equity, before or by any court, government agency, public board or body, pending or, to the best of my knowledge, threatened against the District affecting the corporate existence of the District or the titles of its officers to their respective offices, or affecting or seeking to prohibit, restrain or enjoin the sale, issuance or delivery of the Bonds or the collection of the Revenues (as defined in the Resolution) or the Net Revenues (as defined in the Resolution) pledged or to be pledged to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds or contesting or affecting as to the District the validity or enforceability of the Act, the Bonds, the Resolution, the Escrow Agreement, the Contract of Purchase or the Undertaking, or contesting the tax exempt status of interest on the Bonds, or which may result in any material adverse change relating to the District, other than routine litigation of the type which normally accompanies its operation of its generation, transmission and distribution facilities, or contesting the completeness or accuracy of the Preliminary Official Statement or the Official Statement or any supplement or amendment thereto, or contesting the powers of the District or any authority for the issuance of the Bonds, the adoption of the Resolution, or the execution and delivery by the District of the Contract of Purchase, the Escrow Agreement, or the Undertaking, nor, to the best of my knowledge, is there any basis for any such action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or finding would materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Act or the authorization, execution, delivery or performance by the District of the Bonds, the Resolution, the Escrow Agreement, the Undertaking, or the Contract of Purchase.

6. Based upon my review of the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement as General Counsel to the District and without having undertaken to determine independently the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement and the Official Statement (except as specifically set forth in paragraph 4 hereof), I have no reason to believe that the statements contained in the Preliminary Official Statement (except for information relating Cede & Co., DTC or the operation of the book-entry system, the Appendices (except Appendix A) to the Preliminary Official Statement, and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to all of which I express no view) as of its date and as of the date of the Contract of Purchase contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and the Official Statement (except for information relating Cede & Co., DTC or the operation of the book-entry system, the Appendices (except Appendix A) to the Official Statement, and other financial and statistical data included therein, as to all of which I express no view) (A) as of the date of the Official Statement contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (B) as of the date hereof contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

For purposes of the opinions expressed herein, I have assumed that an agreement or other document is "material" to the District if it involves amounts in excess of $10,000,000 and

C-3

<!-- Page 98 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

that a matter would result in a “material adverse change” to the District if the financial consequences involved would exceed $10,000,000.

I understand that you are relying upon the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel, with respect to the validity of the Bonds and the exclusion of interest on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes and the Bonds for purposes of State of California income taxation and, accordingly, render no opinion with respect thereto.

Very truly yours,

**NEW ISSUE - FULL BOOK-ENTRY**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD, based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and, assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series M Bonds. See “TAX MATTERS.”

ELECTRIC REVENUE BONDS, 2024 SERIES M

The Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M (the “2024 Series M Bonds”) will be issued pursuant to the provisions of Resolution No. 6649 of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”), as amended and supplemented, and will be payable from the Net Revenues of the Electric System of SMUD, as described herein. The 2024 Series M Bonds are being issued to (i) finance and refinance certain improvements and additions to SMUD’s Electric System, including by paying the outstanding principal amount of SMUD’s commercial paper notes at maturity, and (ii) pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds. See “PLAN OF FINANCE.”

The 2024 Series M Bonds will mature in the years and amounts as shown on the inside cover. Interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds will accrue at the rates set forth on the inside cover and be payable on [______, 2024], and semiannually thereafter on each [_____] and [_____].

The 2024 Series M Bonds are subject to redemption prior to maturity as described herein. See “THE 2024 SERIES M BONDS – Redemption Provisions.”

The 2024 Series M Bonds have been designated as “Green Bonds – Climate Bond Certified.” Kestrel has provided an independent external review and opinion that the 2024 Series M Bonds conform with the Climate Bonds Standard (Version 4.0), and therefore qualify for Climate Bonds designation. See “DESIGNATION OF 2024 SERIES M BONDS AS GREEN BONDS – CLIMATE BOND CERTIFIED” herein and APPENDIX G – “CLIMATE BOND VERIFIER’S REPORT” hereto for more information.

The 2024 Series M Bonds will be issued in fully registered form and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). DTC will act as securities depository (the “Securities Depository”) for the 2024 Series M Bonds. Individual purchasers of interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds may be made in book-entry form only, in the principal amount of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. Purchasers of such interests will not receive certificates representing their interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds. Principal and interest are payable directly to the Securities Depository by U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, Trustee and Paying Agent. Upon receipt of payments of principal and interest, the Securities Depository will in turn remit such principal and interest to the Securities Depository’s Direct Participants (as such term is herein-defined) for subsequent distribution to the purchasers of interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds, as described herein. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.”

The principal of and interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds, together with the debt service on other Parity Bonds (as defined herein), are payable exclusively from and secured by a pledge of the Net Revenues of the Electric System of SMUD. Neither the credit nor the taxing power of SMUD or the State of California is pledged to the payment of the 2024 Series M Bonds.

**OFFICIAL STATEMENT**  
**Relating to**  
**SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT**  
**$[PRINCIPAL AMOUNT]†**  
**ELECTRIC REVENUE BONDS, 2024 SERIES M**  

**INTRODUCTION**  

This Official Statement, including the cover page and Appendices attached hereto, describes the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”), a political subdivision of the State of California (the “State”), and its $[PRINCIPAL AMOUNT]† Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M (the “2024 Series M Bonds”), in connection with the sale by SMUD of the 2024 Series M Bonds. The 2024 Series M Bonds are being issued to (i) finance and refinance certain improvements and additions to SMUD’s Electric System, including by paying the outstanding principal amount of SMUD’s commercial paper notes at maturity, [and] (ii) pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds]. See “PLAN OF FINANCE.”  

The 2024 Series M Bonds are part of an Electric Revenue Bond authorization of SMUD and are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 (the “Master Resolution”) adopted in 1971, as amended and supplemented, and applicable California law, including Article 6a of Chapter 6 of the Municipal Utility District Act (Public Utilities Code Sections 12850 to 12860) (the “Act”), the Revenue Bond Law of 1941 (Government Code Section 54300 et seq.) and Article 11 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code (Government Code Section 53580 et seq.). The issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds was authorized on March 21, 2024, by the Board of Directors of SMUD by a Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution (the “Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution”) supplemental to the Master Resolution. The Master Resolution and all supplemental resolutions, including the Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, are collectively referred to herein as the “Resolution.” See APPENDIX D — “SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION.”  

The purchasers of the 2024 Series M Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series M Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution. See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Consent to Amendments to the Resolution.”  

The 2024 Series M Bonds and other bonds issued on a parity therewith pursuant to the Resolution are collectively referred to herein as the “Bonds.” The Bonds, together with other Parity Bonds (as defined herein), are payable solely from the Net Revenues of the Electric System. See “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS.” As of December 31, 2023, Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $1,783,965,000 were outstanding under the Resolution.  

The issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds is a component of a plan of finance (the “Plan of Finance”) that includes the issuance of SMUD’s Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2024 Series N (the “2024 Series N Bonds”) to refund certain of SMUD’s outstanding Bonds (the “Refunded Bonds”). The issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds is not contingent upon the implementation of the other components of the Plan of Finance, and SMUD is not obligated to implement any of the components of the Plan of Finance. If the Plan of Finance is implemented in whole, then upon completion of the Plan of Finance,  

* Preliminary, subject to change.

Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $[________] are expected to be outstanding under the Resolution. See "PLAN OF FINANCE."

Although the Resolution establishes an “Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund” (the “Reserve Fund”), the Reserve Fund does not secure and will not be available to pay debt service on the 2024 Series M Bonds. The Reserve Fund secures all Bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 that are currently outstanding (and not otherwise deemed to be paid and discharged under the Resolution) and may secure additional Bonds issued in the future.

U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association serves as trustee and paying agent under the Resolution (in such capacities, the “Trustee” and the “Paying Agent” respectively).

From time to time, SMUD issues Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the “Subordinate Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 were outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of the Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series M Bonds).

SMUD also issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of December 31, 2023, Notes in the principal amount of $150,000,000 were outstanding. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by a series of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes (and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit) are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal, premium if any, and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series M Bonds) and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. SMUD expects to pay all $150,000,000 of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes with a portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series M Bonds. See "PLAN OF FINANCE."

SMUD has also previously issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes pursuant to a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”). As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future. SMUD’s payment obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series M Bonds) and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

SMUD is responsible for the acquisition, generation, transmission and distribution of electric power to its service area, which includes most of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD served a population of approximately 1.5 million with a total annual retail load of approximately 10,104 million kilowatt hours (“kWh”). SMUD owns and operates an electric system which, as of December 31, 2023, included generating facilities owned and operated by SMUD with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 775 megawatts (“MW”), local gas-fired plants owned and operated by a joint powers authority and managed by SMUD.
<!-- Page 119 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 1,087 MW, over which SMUD has exclusive control of dispatch, and purchased power with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 1,590 MW and transmission and distribution facilities. SMUD’s power requirements exceed its generating capacity and thus SMUD has agreements with others (including the Local Gas-Fired Plants as defined in APPENDIX A) for the purchase of a portion of its power requirements. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Supply Resources.” Continuing development of SMUD’s business strategy in response to changing environmental and regulatory requirements has had, and is expected to continue to have, a major effect on SMUD’s power supply planning. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – BUSINESS STRATEGY.”

Pursuant to a Continuing Disclosure Agreement, dated the date of issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds (the “Continuing Disclosure Agreement”) between SMUD and the Trustee, SMUD will covenant for the benefit of the holders of the 2024 Series M Bonds and owners of beneficial interest in the 2024 Series M Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data and to provide certain notices. See “CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING” and APPENDIX F – “FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.”

The information presented in this Introduction is qualified in its entirety by reference to this entire Official Statement and the documents summarized or described herein. This Official Statement, including the Appendices, summarizes the terms of the 2024 Series M Bonds, the Resolution and certain agreements, contracts and other arrangements, some of which currently exist and others of which exist in the future. The summaries of and references to all documents, statutes, regulations and other instruments referred to herein are not to be complete, comprehensive or definitive, and each such summary and reference is qualified in its entirety by reference to each such document, statute, regulation or instrument.

Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Official Statement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in APPENDIX D – “SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION – Certain Definitions” or in the Resolution.

**PLAN OF FINANCE**

**Issuance of 2024 Series M Bonds**

The proceeds of the 2024 Series M Bonds will be used to (i) finance and refinance certain improvements and additions to SMUD’s Electric System, including by paying the outstanding principal amount of SMUD’s commercial paper notes at maturity, [and (ii) pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds]. The issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds is a component of the Plan of Finance, as further described below. The issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds is not contingent upon the implementation of the other components of the Plan of Finance, and SMUD is not obligated to implement any of the components of the Plan of Finance.

**Issuance of 2024 Series N Bonds and Refunding of Refunded Bonds**

Concurrently with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds, SMUD expects to issue approximately $[_____]† aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Series N Bonds to (i) refund the  
* Preliminary, subject to change.
<!-- Page 120 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

$200,000,000 outstanding principal amount of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”), (ii) refund the $250,000,000 outstanding principal amount of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series W (the “2010 Series W Bonds” and, together with the 2009 Series V Bonds, the “Refunded Bonds”) [and (iii) pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds].

The Refunded Bonds were issued as bonds designated as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the “Recovery Act”). At the time the Refunded Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive cash subsidy payments from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the Refunded Bonds as required by sections 54AA and 6431 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (as such sections were added to the Code by the Recovery Act). However, as a result of the enactment of the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the “Budget Control Act”) and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (the “Taxpayer Relief Act”) the subsidy payments for the Refunded Bonds became subject to sequestration and have been reduced to an amount less than 35% of the interest payable on the Refunded Bonds as originally required by sections 54AA and 6431 of the Code. See also APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments.”

The 2009 Series V Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption upon the occurrence of an “Extraordinary Event.” Pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions for the 2009 Series V Bonds, an “Extraordinary Event” will have occurred if SMUD determines that a material adverse change has occurred to Section 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as such Sections were added by Section 1531 of the Recovery Act), pertaining to Build America Bonds, or if the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury makes a determination by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury with respect to such Sections or any other determination by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury, which determination is not the result of an act or omission by SMUD to satisfy the requirements to receive the 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury, pursuant to which SMUD’s 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury is reduced or eliminated.

The 2010 Series W Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption upon the occurrence of a “Tax Law Change.” Pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions for the 2010 Bonds, “Tax Law Change” means legislation has been enacted by the Congress of the United States or passed by either House of the Congress, or a decision has been rendered by a court of the United States, or an order, ruling, regulation (final, temporary or proposed) or official statement has been made by or on behalf of the Treasury Department of the United States, the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental agency of appropriate jurisdiction, the effect of which, as reasonably determined by SMUD, would be to suspend, reduce or terminate the payment from the United States Treasury to SMUD with respect to the 2010 Series W Bonds, or to state or local government issuers generally with respect to obligations of the general character of the 2010 Series W Bonds, pursuant to Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code of an amount equal to 35% of the interest due thereon on each interest payment date (the “Subsidy Payments”); provided, that such suspension, reduction or termination of the Subsidy Payments is not due to a failure by the District to comply with the requirements under the Code to receive such Subsidy Payments.

The extraordinary optional redemption provisions for each series of the Refunded Bonds are described in the related Official Statement for such series of Refunded Bonds. The Official Statements for the Refunded Bonds can be found at the following links:

For various reasons, including but not limited to, the enactment of the Budget Control Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act and the resulting reduction of the cash subsidy payments required to be paid by the United States Treasury to SMUD with respect to the Refunded Bonds pursuant to section 6431 of the Code, SMUD has determined that an “Extraordinary Event” has occurred with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and that a “Tax Law Change” has occurred with respect to the 2010 Series W Bonds. Therefore, SMUD expects to redeem the Refunded Bonds pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions applicable to each series of the Refunded Bonds.

[If the 2024 Series N Bonds are issued, then a portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds, [together with other available funds], will be deposited in one or more escrow funds (the “Escrow Funds”) established under one or more escrow agreements between SMUD and the Trustee. The moneys so deposited will be invested in direct obligations of the United States of America (the “Federal Securities”), the interest on and principal of which, together with other moneys held in the Escrow Funds, are expected to be in an amount sufficient to pay the interest on the Refunded Bonds due on [____] (the “Redemption Date”) and to redeem the Refunded Bonds on the Redemption Date at their respective redemption prices. [Upon deposit, all liability of SMUD with respect to the Refunded Bonds (except for the obligation of SMUD to pay the interest on and redemption price of the Refunded Bonds from moneys on deposit in the Escrow Fund) will cease. The Refunded Bonds will be entitled to payment from SMUD solely from moneys or Federal Securities on deposit in the Escrow Fund, and the Refunded Bonds will no longer be outstanding under the Resolution.] [Notwithstanding the depositing of the Escrow Funds, the Refunded Bonds will remain outstanding, and SMUD will remain liable for the payment of the principal and redemption price of and interest on the Refunded Bonds, until the Refunded Bonds are actually redeemed in full on the Redemption Date.] The Federal Securities and moneys in the Escrow Funds will not secure the 2024 Series M Bonds and will not be available to pay the principal of or interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds.]

[If the 2024 Series N Bonds are issued, then a portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds, [together with other available funds], will be used to pay the interest on the Refunded Bonds due on [____] (the “Redemption Date”) and to redeem the Refunded Bonds on the Redemption Date at their respective redemption prices.]

# THE 2024 SERIES M BONDS

The 2024 Series M Bonds will mature in the years and amounts and bear interest at the rates set forth on the inside cover page hereof. Interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds will accrue from the date of delivery of the 2024 Series M Bonds, and will be payable on [____], 2024, and semiannually thereafter on each [____] and [____] (each, an “Interest Payment Date”) to the owners thereof as of the first day of the month (whether or not such day is a Business Day) in which an Interest Payment Date occurs (each, a “Record Date”).

The 2024 Series M Bonds will be issued in fully registered form and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). DTC will act as securities depository (the “Securities Depository”) for the 2024 Series M Bonds. Individual purchases of interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds will be made in book-entry form only, in the principal amount of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. Purchasers of such interests will not receive certificates representing their interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds. Principal and interest are payable directly to the Securities Depository by the Trustee. Upon receipt of payments of principal and interest, the Securities Depository will in turn remit such principal and interest to the Securities Depository’s Direct Participants (as such term is hereinafter defined) for subsequent disbursement to the purchasers of interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.”

## Redemption Provisions*

### Optional Redemption.
On any date on or after [____], 20__, the 2024 Series M Bonds maturing on and after [____], 20__ are subject to redemption prior to their stated maturities at the option of the Issuer, from any source of available funds, as a whole or in part, at the principal amount thereof, without premium, together with accrued interest to the date fixed for redemption.

### Mandatory Redemption.
The 2024 Series M Bonds maturing on [____], 20__, are subject to mandatory redemption prior to maturity, in part, by lot, from sinking fund payments required for the 2024 Series M Bonds by the Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution at the principal amount thereof together with the accrued interest thereon to the date fixed for redemption, without premium, as shown below:

**Selection of Bonds for Redemption.** If less than all of a maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the 2024 Series M Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed, from the Outstanding 2024 Series M Bonds of such maturity not previously called for redemption, by lot in any manner the Trustee deems fair. For so long as the book-entry only system is in effect with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds, DTC shall select the 2024 Series M Bonds to be redeemed in accordance with the procedures of DTC.

**Notice of Redemption.** Notice of redemption for the 2024 Series M Bonds will be given by publication at least once in financial newspapers or journals, selected by the Trustee, of general circulation in San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, each such publication to be not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption, if at any time the 2024 Series M Bonds are not in book entry form. Notice also will be mailed to the registered owners of any 2024 Series M Bonds designated for redemption, but failure to mail such notice or any defect therein with respect to any particular 2024 Series M Bonds will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other 2024 Series M Bonds. For so long as the book-entry-only system is in effect with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds, the Trustee will mail notice of redemption solely to DTC or its nominee or its successor. Any failure of DTC or its successor, or of a direct or indirect DTC participant, to notify a beneficial owner of a 2024 Series M Bond of any redemption will not affect the sufficiency or validity of the redemption of any 2024 Series M Bond. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.” SMUD may instruct the Trustee to give conditional notice of optional redemption, which may be conditioned upon the receipt of moneys or any other event.

# SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

## General

The principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds, together with other Parity Bonds, are payable exclusively from, and are secured by a pledge (effected in the manner and to the extent provided in the Resolution), of the Net Revenues of the Electric System of SMUD.

Neither the credit nor the taxing power of SMUD is pledged to the payment of the Bonds and the general fund of SMUD is not liable for the payment thereof. The owners of the Bonds cannot compel the exercise of any taxing power of SMUD or the forfeiture of any of its property. The Bonds are not a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any of SMUD’s property (including the Electric System) or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues except the Net Revenues of the Electric System to the extent of the pledge thereof contained in the Resolution.

## Consent to Amendments to the Resolution

The purchasers of the 2024 Series M Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series M Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution (the “Proposed Amendments”). Such amendments are described in **bold italic** font herein under “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Rates and Charges” and “– Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues” and in APPENDIX D – “SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION – Certain Definitions” and “– Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds.” The written consents to the Proposed Amendments of the holders and registered owners of at least 60% of the Bonds outstanding have been filed with SMUD or the Trustee, as required by the Resolution. However, while certain Bonds remain outstanding, SMUD must also obtain the written consents of certain bond insurers to implement the Proposed Amendments. SMUD expects to implement the Proposed Amendments when the written consents of such bond insurers are obtained or
<!-- Page 127 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

when the Bonds insured by such bond insurers are no longer outstanding. The final maturity date of the insured Bonds is July 1, 2024.

**Allocation of Revenues**

After making an allocation of Revenues to Maintenance and Operation Costs and to Energy Payments not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs, the Treasurer of SMUD is required (subject to the last paragraph of this section) to set aside, on an equal priority with sums set aside for all other Parity Bonds, Net Revenues as follows:

**First:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Interest Fund, in approximately equal monthly installments on or before the first day of each month, an amount equal to at least one-fifth (1/5) of the aggregate amount of interest becoming due on the Bonds on the next succeeding semiannual interest payment date, until an amount sufficient to meet said interest payment is accumulated.

**Second:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Redemption Fund, to be set aside in the Principal Account and Sinking Fund, respectively, in approximately equal monthly installments on or before the first day of each month, an amount equal to at least one-tenth (1/10) of the aggregate amount of principal becoming due on serial Bonds and the aggregate minimum sinking fund payments required to be made with respect to term Bonds during the next ensuing 12 months, until an amount sufficient to meet the principal and sinking fund requirements on all Bonds outstanding is accumulated in said accounts, respectively.

**Third:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund, such amounts as any supplemental resolution authorizing the issuance of a series of Bonds may require to build up and maintain said fund.

If interest on Bonds of a series or maturity is payable more frequently than semiannually, the Treasurer of SMUD shall set aside out of Net Revenues in the Interest Fund such amounts as may be required to pay interest on the Bonds of such series or maturity on each interest payment date at least one month prior to such interest payment date. Allocation to the Electric Revenue Bond Redemption Fund and Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund shall be made as set forth above.

All remaining Revenues, after making the foregoing allocations, will be available to SMUD for all lawful SMUD purposes.

From time to time, SMUD may deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund from such remaining Revenues such amounts as SMUD shall determine, provided that deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund from remaining Revenues in any fiscal year may be made until (but not after) the date 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. SMUD may withdraw amounts from the Rate Stabilization Fund only for inclusion in Revenues for any fiscal year, such withdrawals to be made until (but not after) 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. All interest or other earnings upon deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be withdrawn therefrom and accounted for as Revenues. No deposit of Revenues to the Rate Stabilization Fund may be made to the extent such Revenues were included in any certificate submitted in connection with the issuance of additional bonds and withdrawal of the Revenues from the Revenues employed in rendering said certificate would have caused noncompliance with the additional bond provisions or to the extent withdrawals of the Revenues for any fiscal year would have reduced the debt.
<!-- Page 128 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Page)  

service ratio for such fiscal year to or below 1.40:1.00. See APPENDIX A – “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” for a description of the balance in the Rate Stabilization Fund.

With respect to Bonds of a series issued on or after October 1, 2003 (including the 2024 Series M Bonds), notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Bonds of such series or maturity are outstanding, the supplemental resolution authorizing the issuance of such series shall require the Treasurer, out of Net Revenues received by SMUD, to set aside in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, such amounts as may be required so that an amount equal to the amount of principal and/or interest becoming due and payable on the Bonds of such series or maturity on each interest payment date and principal payment date is on deposit in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, at such time on or prior to such interest payment date or principal payment date as shall be specified in the supplemental resolution authorizing such Bonds.

**Rates and Charges**

SMUD has covenanted in the Resolution to establish and at all times maintain and collect rates and charges for the sale or use of electric energy generated, transmitted, distributed or furnished by SMUD which, together with certain items of other income permitted under the Resolution, will yield Revenues at least sufficient, with respect to the ensuing 12 months, to pay and provide for all sums required for Maintenance and Operation Costs and Energy Payments not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs and, in addition, to provide an aggregate sum equal to at least 1.20 times the total amount required for the payment of principal and interest, together with any sinking fund or reserve fund payments, on the Bonds and all Parity Bonds, in each case during such 12 months.

For purposes of the calculations of payments to be made pursuant to the Resolution, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, if a Financial Products Agreement has been entered into by SMUD with respect to any Parity Bonds, interest on such Parity Bonds shall be included in the calculation of such principal and interest by including for each fiscal year or period an amount equal to the amount of interest payable on such Parity Bonds in such fiscal year or period at the rate or rates stated in such Parity Bonds plus any Financial Product Payments payable in such fiscal year or period minus any Financial Product Receipts receivable in such fiscal year or period; provided that in no event shall any calculation made pursuant to this clause result in a number less than zero being included in the calculation of such principal and interest.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, Excluded Principal Payments shall be disregarded (but interest on the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payments relate shall be included until but not after the stated due date when principal payments on such Parity Bonds are scheduled by their terms to commence) and Assumed Principal Payments and Assumed Interest Payments shall be included; and for purposes of the above calculations of interest on Parity Bonds, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

![SMUD Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Document)

SMUD has full power to establish rates and charges for all SMUD services, and the levels of such rates are not subject to review or regulation by any other governmental agency, either federal or state.

For purposes of the calculations specified in this section: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments” for a description of the current Subsidy that SMUD receives with respect to the Refunded Bonds.

**Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues**

The Resolution provides that SMUD will not, so long as any Bonds are outstanding, issue any obligations payable in whole or in part from Revenues except the following:

1. Refunding bonds issued solely to refund all or part of the Bonds or Parity Bonds;

2. General obligation bonds or other securities secured by the full faith and credit of SMUD;

3. Additional revenue bonds (including additional Bonds under the Resolution and additional Parity Bonds), payable on a parity with the Bonds, with an equal lien and charge upon the Revenues, but only subject to the following conditions:

   (a) Such additional revenue bonds shall have been authorized for the proceeds therefrom required to be applied to additions, betterments, extensions or improvements to the Electric System (and necessary costs of issuance, interest during construction and reserve funds);

   (b) The proceedings for the issuance of such additional revenue bonds shall require SMUD to fix and collect rates and charges in an amount not less, with respect to such bonds, than the amounts required with respect to Bonds issued under the Resolution;

   (c) SMUD shall not then be in default under the Resolution or other resolutions authorizing the issuance of Parity Bonds; and

   (d) The Trustee shall receive a certificate of SMUD to the effect (i) that Net Revenues, after completion of the improvements proposed to be financed by such additional revenue bonds, will be sufficient to pay the principal of and interest (and bond reserve fund requirements) on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding and on such additional revenue bonds; and (ii) that for a period of 12 consecutive months during the 24 months immediately preceding the issuance of the additional revenue bonds the Net Revenues have been at least equal to 1.25 times maximum annual debt service on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding and on such additional revenue bonds (after adjusting Net Revenues to include 75 percent of the estimated additional Net Revenues to be derived from an increase in rates and charges or from the acquisition of an existing revenue producing electric system); and
<!-- Page 130 -->
4. Revenue bonds junior and subordinate to the Bonds and Parity Bonds.

For purposes of the above calculations, Excluded Principal Payments shall be disregarded (but interest on the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payments relate shall be included until but not after the stated due date when principal payments on such Parity Bonds are scheduled by their terms to commence) and Assumed Principal Payments and Assumed Interest Payments shall be included; and for purposes of the above calculations of interest on Parity Bonds, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, if a Financial Products Agreement has been entered into by SMUD with respect to any Parity Bonds, interest on such Parity Bonds shall be included in the calculation of such principal and interest by including for each fiscal year or period an amount equal to the amount of interest payable on such Parity Bonds in such fiscal year or period at the rate or rates stated in such Parity Bonds plus any Financial Product Payments payable in such fiscal year or period minus any Financial Product Receipts receivable in such fiscal year or period; provided that in no event shall any calculation made pursuant to this clause result in a number less than zero being included in the calculation of such principal and interest.

For purposes of the calculations specified in this section: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Net Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Estimated Capital Requirements” for a description of SMUD’s projected capital requirements. Such capital requirements may be satisfied through the issuance of additional Bonds or Parity Bonds.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments” for a description of the current Subsidy that SMUD receives with respect to the Refunded Bonds.

![Financial Statements and Tax Matters](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Financial+Statements+and+Tax+Matters)

**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

SMUD’s audited, consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are included in APPENDIX B attached to this Official Statement. These financial statements have been audited by Baker Tilly US, LLP, Madison, Wisconsin (the “Auditor”), for the periods indicated and to the extent set forth in their report thereon and should be read in their entirety. SMUD has not requested nor did it obtain permission from the Auditor to include the audited, consolidated financial statements as an appendix to this Official Statement. Accordingly, the Auditor has not performed any procedures to review the financial condition or operations of SMUD subsequent to the date of its report included therein, nor has it reviewed any information contained in this Official Statement.

**TAX MATTERS**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series M Bonds. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in APPENDIX E hereto.

To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of such 2024 Series M Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the term of such 2024 Series M Bonds), the difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of which, to the extent properly allocable to each Beneficial Owner thereof, is treated as interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and exempt from State of California personal income taxes. For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is the first price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds is sold to the public (excluding bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds accrues daily over the term to maturity of such 2024 Series M Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original issue discount is added to the adjusted basis of such 2024 Series M Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon trade or business disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment at maturity) of such 2024 Series M Bonds. Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series M Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of 2024 Series M Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of Beneficial Owners who do not purchase such 2024 Series M Bonds in the original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such 2024 Series M Bonds is sold to the public.

2024 Series M Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than their principal amount payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier call date) (“Premium Bonds”) will be treated as having amortizable bond premium. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the case of bonds, like the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is.

**Page 18**

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the 2024 Series M Bonds. SMUD has made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken), or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the 2024 Series M Bonds. Accordingly, the opinion of Bond Counsel is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters.

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of amounts treated as interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds may otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. The nature and extent of these tax consequences depend upon the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial Owner’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may cause interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent Beneficial Owners from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals or clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the 2024 Series M Bonds. Prospective purchasers of the 2024 Series M Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the 2024 Series M Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of SMUD, or about the effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. SMUD has covenanted, however, to comply with the requirements of the Code.

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds ends with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend SMUD or the Beneficial Owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the 2024 Series M Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, Beneficial Owners would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in

**CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING**  
Pursuant to the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, SMUD will covenant for the benefit of the holders and the “Beneficial Owners” (as defined in the Continuing Disclosure Agreement) of the 2024 Series M Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data relating to SMUD by not later than 180 days after the end of each SMUD’s fiscal years (presently, each December 31), commencing with the report for the year ending December 31, 2024 (the “Annual Report”), and to provide notices of the occurrence of certain listed events with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds. The Annual Report will be filed by or on behalf of SMUD with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”) through its Electronic Municipal Market Access system (“EMMA”) and any notices of such listed events will be filed by or on behalf of SMUD with the MSRB through EMMA. The specific nature of the information to be contained in the Annual Report and the notices of listed events are set forth in the form of the Continuing Disclosure Agreement which is included in its entirety in APPENDIX F hereto. SMUD’s covenant will be made in order to assist the Underwriters in complying with Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12.  
**[UPDATE/CONFIRM]** [In a limited number of circumstances, certain of the annual reports, audited financial statements or listed event filings required to be made by SMUD during the last five years under its continuing disclosure undertakings were not connected to all of the CUSIP numbers of the bonds subject to the continuing disclosure undertakings. In addition, SMUD entered into two subordinated forward starting interest rate swaps in December 2019 and filed a notice of the interest rate swaps with the MSRB through EMMA in April 2020. A notice of rating upgrade on October 6, 2020, by Moody’s Investors Service of the Northern California Gas Authority No. 1 Gas Project Revenue Bonds, Series 2007B, was also not filed until October 28, 2020.]

# RATINGS

Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) have assigned ratings of “[AA (stable outlook)]” and “[Aa2 (stable outlook)],” respectively, to the 2024 Series M Bonds. Such ratings reflect only the views of such organizations and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the 2024 Series M Bonds. Explanations of the significance of such ratings may be obtained only from the respective rating agencies. SMUD has furnished to Fitch and Moody’s certain information and materials concerning the 2024 Series M Bonds and itself.

There is no assurance that such ratings will continue for any given period or that they will not be revised downward, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the respective rating agencies, if in the judgment of such rating agency, circumstances so warrant. SMUD has not, other than as described under “CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING” above, and the Underwriters have not undertaken any responsibility either to bring to the attention of the holders or beneficial owners of the 2024 Series M Bonds any proposed revision, suspension or withdrawal of any rating on the 2024 Series M Bonds or to oppose any such proposed revision, suspension or withdrawal. Any such downward revision, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the 2024 Series M Bonds.

# INTRODUCTION

## General

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) owns and operates an electric system that has provided retail electric service since 1946. SMUD’s current service area is approximately 900 square miles, and includes the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. See “THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM – The Service Area.”

## Independent Governance

SMUD is an independently run community-owned organization. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government.

SMUD is governed by a Board of Directors (the “Board”), which consists of seven directors elected by ward for staggered four-year terms. The Board determines policy and appoints the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, who is responsible for SMUD’s overall management and day-to-day operations. The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager is responsible for the hiring and removal of all employees, other than the Chief Legal and Government Affairs Officer and General Counsel, the Internal Auditor and the Special Assistant to the Board, who are hired and may be removed only by the Board. The employment status of nearly all SMUD employees is governed by a civil service system administered by the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager.

The Board elects its President and Vice President annually to take office in January. The current members of the Board are as follows:

| Name                     | Occupation                                               | Ward  | Term Expires     |

The Electric System  
SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities.

SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through a 230 kilovolt (“kV”) and 115 kV transmission system. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) and the Western Area Power Administration (“WAPA”). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system with the exception of the City’s downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission system. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV substations with overhead and underground 12 kV distribution circuits.

SMUD’s Board of Directors has established the following purpose and vision statements: “SMUD’s purpose is to enhance the quality of life for our customers and community by providing reliable and affordable electricity, and leading the transition to a clean energy future. SMUD’s vision is to be a trusted and powerful partner in achieving an inclusive, zero carbon economy. SMUD will leverage its relationships to accelerate innovation, ensure energy affordability and reliability, protect the environment, eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, catalyze economic and workforce development, promote environmental justice, and enhance community vitality for all.” The Board has adopted a set of Strategic Directions with related metrics, which it considers essential for the success of SMUD and for serving SMUD’s customers. These include competitive rates, access to credit markets, reliability, customer relations, environmental leadership, resource planning, enterprise risk management and safety. Some of the general elements in SMUD’s business strategy are:

- developing and maintaining a sustainable and reliable power supply to meet demand growth consistent with State mandates and the Board’s directions for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions to zero by 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”;
- working closely with customers to provide the information, tools and incentives to assist them to more efficiently manage energy use, which will contribute to meeting greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission targets and managing needle peak demand requirements (those 40 or so hours of the year with extreme temperatures when customer demand surges by up to 400 additional MW);
- managing price, volumetric and credit risks associated with energy and natural gas procurement;
- attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, skilled and engaged workforce that reflects SMUD’s values and is committed to achieving SMUD’s mission;
- retaining local decision making authority and operational independence; and
- collaborating regionally to attract new businesses and grow existing business to diversify and strengthen the Sacramento economy.

SMUD’s long-range business strategy focuses in part on ensuring financial stability by establishing rates that provide an acceptable fixed charge coverage ratio on a consolidated basis, taking into consideration the impact of capital expenditures and other factors on cash flow.

with current energy market prices. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges.”

**Renewable Options.** SMUD’s customers have been increasingly interested in distributed energy resources, mainly through the installation of solar systems. As of December 2023, approximately 51,374 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, approximately 8% of retail customers, had installed solar systems, representing approximately 360 MW of solar installations.

As the cost of energy storage continues to decline, SMUD anticipates an increase in behind-the-meter energy storage, mainly through the installation of battery storage systems. As of December 2023, approximately 1,532 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, had installed storage systems, representing approximately 10 MW of storage.

As another option for solar, SMUD’s SolarShares® pilot program (the “SolarShares Pilot”) was established as a cost-effective and convenient way for commercial customers to meet their energy needs from solar power. The SolarShares Pilot offered SMUD commercial customers the opportunity to receive solar power without upfront costs or equipment installation through 5-, 10- or 20-year purchase contracts. Customers that entered into purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot receive up to half of their power from a utility-scale solar system. SMUD supplies solar power for the SolarShares Pilot either by building and maintaining utility-scale solar systems or by procuring solar power from third parties through power purchase agreements. The SolarShares Pilot generation was approximately 3.2% of retail sales in 2023. As of April 30, 2021, SMUD had completed the SolarShares Pilot and is not entering into new purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot.

Since January 2020, the California Building Code has required all new constructed residential buildings under three stories to be powered by photovoltaic solar systems. A new home satisfies this requirement if it installs on-site solar or participates in an approved community solar or energy storage program. In February 2020, SMUD obtained approval from the California Energy Commission (“CEC”) to administer its own community solar program, called Neighborhood SolarShares® (“Neighborhood SolarShares”). SMUD’s Neighborhood SolarShares program can be used by developers of new low-rise residential buildings to satisfy the mandatory solar requirement. See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Rooftop Solar Mandate.” Starting in 2023, the California Building Code’s mandatory solar requirement extends beyond low-rise residential properties, and other changes to the California Building Code’s community solar regulations took effect. SMUD revised its program to align with the new regulations and, in May 2023, obtained approval from the CEC to continue offering its Neighborhood SolarShares compliance option to newly constructed low rise residential homes in its service territory.

In addition to the SolarShares Pilot and Neighborhood SolarShares, SMUD maintains a voluntary green energy pricing program called Greenery® (“Greenery”). The Greenery program allows customers the opportunity to pay an additional amount per month to ensure that either all or part of their electricity comes from green or carbon free energy sources. In 2023, the program allocated Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) equivalent to approximately 4.2% of retail sales to its participating customers.

**Energy Efficiency.** To further assist customers in managing energy use and reducing regional carbon emissions and air pollution, SMUD offers an extensive array of energy efficiency and building electrification programs and services including financial incentives, loans, energy audits and education. In addition, SMUD has partnered with local developers to incorporate energy efficiency and all-electric construction measures into new residential and commercial construction, which helps developers plan and design efficient, cost-effective and low or zero-emission buildings. As part of SMUD’s 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), SMUD set a goal for regional carbon emissions through transport and building

# Electrification and Sustainable Power Supply

**Electrification Goals**  
SMUD’s electrification aims to reduce carbon emissions in buildings and transport by 64% over the next 20 years. SMUD’s focus on electrification is continued in the Zero Carbon Plan (defined and discussed below). SMUD was the first electric utility in the country to set its efficiency goals based on carbon reductions, allowing building electrification and energy efficiency to both count toward meeting SMUD’s efficiency goals. This is a significant opportunity, as converting a typical home today to all-electric saves more than three times the carbon emissions compared to doing a major energy efficiency upgrade alone to the same building. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources.”

## Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission

Maintaining a sustainable power supply entails focusing efforts on researching, promoting and implementing new renewable energy technologies and sources to meet SMUD’s long-term commitment to reducing carbon emissions and providing a reliable energy supply. SMUD defines a sustainable power supply as one that reduces SMUD’s GHG emissions to serve retail customer load to zero by 2030. See “– 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”. Below, SMUD is planning to achieve zero GHG emissions to serve retail customer load through investments in energy efficiency, clean distributed energy resources, renewables portfolio standard (“RPS”) eligible renewables, energy storage, large hydroelectric generation, clean and emissions free fuels, carbon capture and sequestration, and new technologies and business models. Additionally, SMUD plans to continue pursuing GHG emissions reductions through vehicle, building and equipment electrification. At the same time, SMUD’s plans for maintaining a sustainable power supply include assuring the reliability of SMUD’s electric system, minimizing environmental impacts on land, habitat, water and air quality, and maintaining competitive rates relative to other electric providers in the State.

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills regulate GHG emissions and promote the development of sustainable generation alternatives, principally through more stringent RPS. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings” herein.

### 2030 Zero Carbon Plan

In July 2020, the Board declared a climate emergency and adopted a resolution calling for SMUD to take significant and consequential actions to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030. On April 28, 2021, the Board approved SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (the “Zero Carbon Plan”). The Zero Carbon Plan is intended to be a flexible roadmap for SMUD to eliminate carbon emissions from its electricity production by 2030 while maintaining reliable and affordable service. To achieve these goals the Zero Carbon Plan is focused on four main areas: natural gas generation repurposing, proven technologies, new technologies and business models and financial impacts and options. SMUD plans to revisit the Zero Carbon Plan annually.

The natural gas generation repurposing focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for exploring the replacement of two of SMUD’s five Local Gas-Fired Plants (as defined herein) and the retooling of the other three Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” Based on SMUD’s studies to date, SMUD estimates that McClellan (as defined herein) and the Campbell Soup Project (as defined herein) can be replaced in the next several years depending on SMUD’s success with replacement resources. Final decisions about the replacement of these two Local Gas-Fired Plants will be based on additional reliability studies and engagement with the community. As part of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is also exploring converting the Carson Project (as defined herein) and the Procter & Gamble Project (as defined herein) to reliability use operations only and investigating the use of alternative fuels like Renewable Natural Gas-biomethane (RNG-biomethane), hydrogen and other biofuels for the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, and the Consumers Power Plant (as defined herein). In addition, SMUD is investigating new technologies such as long duration energy storage, carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and other clean fuel alternatives to help support.

the reduction of GHG emissions in SMUD’s energy supply. All final generator configurations are subject to reliability assessments.

The proven clean technologies focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for SMUD to procure approximately 1,100 to 1,500 MW of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (“PV”) generating capacity, 700 to 1,100 MW of local utility-scale battery storage, 300 to 500 MW of wind generating capacity, and 100 to 220 MW of geothermal generating capacity. The Zero Carbon Plan also estimates that customer installation of approximately 500 to 750 MW of behind-the-meter solar PV generating capacity and approximately 50 to 250 MW of behind-the-meter battery storage will assist SMUD with achieving the Zero Carbon Plan goals.

With respect to new technologies and business models, the Zero Carbon Plan focuses on evaluating, prioritizing and scaling the emerging technologies that SMUD expects will have the largest impact on reducing carbon in SMUD’s 2030 resource mix. SMUD is currently focused on various areas of technology and customer-focused programs, including electrification, demand flexibility, virtual power plants, vehicle-to-grid technology, and new grid-scale technologies. The Zero Carbon Plan forecasts that customer-owned devices and SMUD customer-focused programs will contribute between 360 and 1,300 MW of capacity to SMUD’s grid by 2030.

The financial impacts and options focus of the Zero Carbon Plan aims to keep SMUD rate increases at or below the rate of inflation while achieving SMUD’s goal of eliminating carbon emissions from its power supply by 2030. To pay for the expected costs of the Zero Carbon Plan and keep rate increases at or below the rate of inflation, the Zero Carbon Plan estimates the need for SMUD to realize between $50 million and $150 million of sustained annual savings. SMUD currently plans to achieve these sustained annual savings by exploring the implementation of operational savings and pursuing partnership and grant opportunities.

While the ultimate impacts of the Zero Carbon Plan on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy from clean technologies, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers, such impacts could be material.

Renewable Energy and Climate Change. The California Renewable Energy Resources Act, established by Senate Bill X1-2 (“SBX1-2”) and the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, enacted by Senate Bill 350 (“SB 350”) require that SMUD meets 33% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2020 and 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2030. Senate Bill 100 (“SB 100”), passed by the legislature and approved by then-Governor Brown on September 10, 2018, accelerates the RPS targets and establishes a new 60% target by 2030. The bill also created a planning goal to meet all of the State’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Renewables Portfolio Standards” for a discussion of the State RPS requirements.

SMUD’s compliance with State RPS requirements is evaluated over 3- or 4-year compliance periods. SMUD met the State RPS requirements for the first compliance period (2011-2013) and second compliance period (2014-2016). The third compliance period (2017-2020) required SMUD to source one-third of its energy from renewable resources, and SMUD had sufficient RECs to meet the third compliance period requirements. SMUD filed its 2020 and third compliance period RPS compliance report with the CEC in the second quarter of 2021 and the CEC adopted SMUD’s third compliance period verification report in December 2023. SMUD expects the confirmation letter from the CEC indicating that SMUD was A-9
<!-- Page 151 -->

in full compliance with its third compliance period RPS obligations in the first quarter of 2024. As of the end of the third compliance period (2020), SMUD had approximately one million surplus RECs available to help meet future RPS targets. SMUD expects to file its 2023 RPS compliance report by July 1, 2024, showing that SMUD will have provided approximately 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources in 2023, which is greater than the interim 2023 RPS target of 41.25%. RPS compliance is determined by compliance period and not by individual years and SMUD anticipates having sufficient surplus procured and/or under contract resources in the fourth compliance period (2021-2024) to be in compliance with the RPS requirements. In addition to meeting RPS standards, SMUD serves an additional 7.4% of its customer load with renewable energy through its voluntary SolarShares and Greenergy pricing programs described above. SMUD estimates that it has sufficient renewable energy deliveries, new power supply contract commitments, new power supply commitments under active discussion, and RPS-eligible surplus carryover to meet its RPS requirements through 2025. Additional resources have been identified that are expected to provide sufficient RPS-eligible resources to cover most of SMUD’s RPS requirements through 2030. Future solicitations may be needed to fill any remaining gaps. The following chart illustrates SMUD’s current RPS requirements through 2030 and its existing and committed resources utilized to meet those requirements.

In addition to procuring new sources, meeting the RPS requirements will require replacement of certain existing renewable contracts which expire in future years. While SMUD anticipates it will meet much of its renewable resource requirements through purchased contracts with third parties, it continues to explore additional options, including wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal developments, partnering with other utilities on future projects, and local development options. SMUD’s resource forecast (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources”) accounts for future renewable resources as a component of “Uncommitted Purchases.” To meet SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan goals, SMUD anticipates meeting loads in 2030 with approximately 70-80% renewable resources, in addition to hydro and other new zero carbon technologies. See “– 2030 Zero Carbon Plan” above.

Given the intermittent nature of power from renewable resources such as wind and solar, SMUD is exploring and investing in options that provide the flexibility to manage the intermittency of such renewable resources. Potential options include energy storage resources, which SMUD has committed to as part of the Zero Carbon Plan, and expanding load management resources. Additionally, on April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its membership in BANC, a joint exercise of powers agency formed in 2009, and currently comprised of SMUD, the Modesto Irrigation District (“MID”), the City of Roseville (“Roseville”), the City of Redding (“Redding”), the City of Shasta Lake and the Trinity Public Utilities District, commenced participation in the California Independent System Operator Corporation (“CAISO”) western energy imbalance market (“WEIM”). Participation in the WEIM benefits SMUD by providing it with broader access to balancing resources within the region to help manage its expanding renewable portfolio. In addition, other entities within the BANC Balancing Authority Area began participation in the WEIM on March 25, 2021. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Operational Independence and Local Control” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

In 2022, SMUD’s Board formally adopted the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan as SMUD’s updated IRP. SMUD filed the approved IRP update with the CEC on September 14, 2022, pursuant to the CEC’s guidelines, which called for updating SMUD’s IRP filing within five years of SMUD’s previous filing of April 29, 2019. SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan built upon the April 2019 IRP and set a goal for zero carbon emissions by 2030. SMUD’s next formal IRP process is expected to be completed and filed with the CEC in 2027. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

The State’s carbon cap-and-trade market established pursuant to Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”) began in 2013. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Greenhouse Gas Emissions” for a discussion of AB 32 and the State’s cap-and-trade program. SMUD anticipates that allowances allocated to SMUD will nearly equal SMUD’s compliance obligations under normal water year conditions. Under low water year conditions, SMUD may need to purchase additional allowances to cover its compliance obligations, including carbon obligations related to wholesale energy sales from SMUD’s natural gas power plants. As SMUD implements its clean power goals, SMUD expects its need for these allowances to decline.

There is scientific consensus that increasing concentrations of GHG have caused and will continue to cause a rise in temperatures in the State and around the world. The change in the earth’s average atmospheric temperature, generally referred to as “climate change,” is, among other things, expected to result in a wide range of changes in climate patterns, including increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including droughts and heat waves, more frequent incidences of wildfires, changes in wind patterns, sea level rise and flooding, any of which alone or in combination could materially adversely affect SMUD’s financial results or operations. See also “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION” and “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY – Other Factors.” As described above, SMUD is actively working to meet its sustainable power supply goals.

reduce its own GHG emissions, and assist the local governments in the territory it serves with their desired GHG reductions. In 2016, SMUD introduced the Pilot Natural Refrigerant Incentive Program, its first customer program providing incentives for GHG reduction in addition to kWh savings. SMUD is a founding member and active participant in the Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative, a public private partnership formed to better understand and plan for climate impacts expected in the region. SMUD is also an active member of the United States Department of Energy (the “DOE”) Partnership for Energy Sector Climate Resilience. SMUD regularly reviews scientific findings related to climate change and in 2016 published its Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan. In 2024, SMUD is planning to update the Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan along with other climate resiliency actions.

Energy Storage Systems. Assembly Bill 2514 (“AB 2514”) requires the Board to re-evaluate energy storage goals every three years. In compliance with AB 2514, the Board established a target of 9 MW of energy storage procurement by December 31, 2020, which SMUD has procured. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Energy Storage Systems” for further discussion of AB 2514. In September 2020, the Board directed that energy storage forecasts be implemented through SMUD’s IRP process going forward. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” above for a discussion of SMUD’s IRP. SMUD is also evaluating how to couple utility-scale solar with utility-scale storage to support future system reliability needs and enable energy goals.

Meeting Peak Load. A significant consideration for SMUD will be how it addresses its system peak load. SMUD has implemented programs and tools, such as advanced metering, energy efficiency options, and TOD rates for residential customers, to help customers manage their costs while helping SMUD reduce its peak load. Analysis of 2022 data showed a reduction of approximately 108 MW, weather adjusted, from the 2021 peak period (5-8 p.m. hours). SMUD will continue to monitor the progress and results of the implementation of TOD rates and will use this information to inform future rate actions and load forecasts. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Time-of-Day Rates.”

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved an optional residential Critical Peak Pricing rate (the “Peak Pricing Rate”), which went into effect June 1, 2022. The Peak Pricing Rate is designed to reduce load by increasing the price of energy when the grid is most impacted, up to 50 hours per summer. In exchange, customers on the rate will receive a per kWh discount on summer Off-Peak and Mid-Peak rates. SMUD is also exploring the use of more distributed energy resources and demand response programs that could further reduce SMUD’s system peak.

Operational Independence and Local Control. A key component of SMUD’s business strategy is focused on maintaining its independence in operating and maintaining its resources. As such, SMUD has taken a number of actions to mitigate the potential impacts of various federal and state regulatory actions. For example, in 2002 SMUD established itself as an independent control area (now termed “Balancing Authority”) within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (“WECC”) region. By removing itself from CAISO’s Balancing Authority area, SMUD became responsible for balancing electric supply and demand within its own service territory. This move substantially reduced fees paid to CAISO, preserved operational flexibility and helped to insulate SMUD from the uncertain regulatory environment and tariff structure of CAISO. In addition to decreased financial risks, this independence also reduced SMUD’s exposure to the impacts of capacity and energy shortages in the CAISO Balancing Authority area. Further, as an independent Balancing Authority, SMUD continued to support the statewide electric grid in events of electrical emergencies requiring rotating outages, such as loss of major transmission lines or equipment, as provided in the statewide emergency plan. By 2006, the SMUD Balancing Authority footprint expanded north to the California-Oregon border and south to Modesto, to include the service areas of the WAPA, MID, Redding and Roseville, and TANC-owned 340-mile 500-kV California-Oregon Transmission Project.

(“COTP”). In October 2009, SMUD, with the coordination and cooperation of WAPA, joined the Western Power Pool Reserve Sharing Group, which supports reliability and reduces operating costs. In May 2011, BANC assumed the role of the Balancing Authority, though SMUD continues to oversee operation of the grid on behalf of BANC. BANC members share cost responsibility for balancing authority-related compliance obligations, liabilities, and operations. BANC also serves as an important venue for SMUD and other BANC members to collaborate with respect to operational and market improvements inside the BANC footprint and to preserve their operational independence. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.” On April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its participation in BANC, began operating in the CAISO WEIM, which helps SMUD better manage the integration of renewable energy resources. The CAISO WEIM is a voluntary market, which allows SMUD to maintain its operational independence from the CAISO, while providing SMUD greater access to balancing resources throughout the western region. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

Electricity, Natural Gas, and Related Hedging

SMUD continues to utilize a comprehensive and integrated power and fuel supply strategy to acquire a reliable and diversified portfolio of resources to meet existing and future needs. This strategy includes a combination of both physical supply and financial hedging transactions to reduce price risk exposure over a five-year horizon. SMUD’s physical supply arrangements include ownership of power generating resources, as well as a diversified portfolio of power and fuel supply purchase contracts that range in duration, with a mixture of fixed and variable pricing terms.

With regard to the power purchase contracts, SMUD has entered into a series of contracts for the purchase of electricity to meet its resource needs. SMUD also actively manages its exposure on variable rate electricity purchases, and at times may enter into financial contracts to fix prices by using options to reduce price risk, in each case when warranted by economic conditions. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements.”

With regard to fuel supply contracts, SMUD utilizes a similar strategy of employing financial contracts of various durations to hedge its variable rate fuel supply contracts. As of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply – Supply.”

As provided in SMUD’s natural gas contracts, SMUD may be required to post collateral to various counterparties. As of February 29, 2024, SMUD did not have any collateral posting obligations. A decrease in natural gas prices could result in a collateral posting by SMUD. While the posting of collateral is not an expense for SMUD, it does temporarily encumber unrestricted cash balances.

To hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a pass-through rate component called the Hydro Generation Adjustment (the “IGA”), and established a Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund (the “HRSF”). Similarly, to hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a HGA and established a WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund (“WRSF”). These rate stabilization funds and rate pass through mechanisms help to offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs in years where precipitation levels at SMUD-owned and non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities are low. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

![Managing Risks](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Managing+Risks)

**Managing Risks**  
SMUD maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program, a strategic approach to managing enterprise-wide risks as a portfolio, to help reduce the chance of loss, create greater financial stability and protect SMUD resources. It is designed to maintain an early warning system to monitor changes in, and the emergence of, risks that affect the organization’s business objectives. Under the purview of the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee, composed of executive members and chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, ERM conducts ongoing risk identification, assessments, monitoring, mitigation, risk-based budgeting and reporting. To ensure accountability and oversight, each identified risk is assigned to an executive-level risk owner. Risk status and mitigation efforts are reported monthly to the Board.

**Competitive Challenges**  
In the coming decade, utilities like SMUD may face competition from companies in other industries looking to diversify into the energy sector. Examples of developing competitive areas include retail sale of electricity, distributed electric storage resources, renewable distributed generation (mostly solar in Sacramento), customer installation of fuel cells, third-party electric vehicle charging, home or business automation that enables greater customer participation in energy markets, and third-party provision of energy management software and solutions.

SMUD has a wide range of initiatives to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions and new industry participants. Key areas of focus include:

- **Enhancing customer experience.** Recognizing the importance of meeting customer expectations, SMUD introduced the Customer Experience Strategy in 2016 to provide customers “value for what they pay” and further strengthen customer loyalty. The initiative is focused on ensuring SMUD has the people, systems, technology, programs and services to consistently meet or exceed customers’ changing expectations. The customer experience is measured via surveys with the goal of achieving 80% of customers agreeing that SMUD provides them with value for what they pay by 2030.

- **Restructuring electric rates.** In 2017, the Board approved TOD rates as the standard rate for residential customers. The residential rate transition began in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the full transition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. All of SMUD’s business customers are also on time-based rates. In 2019, the Board approved a restructuring of commercial rates to collect a greater portion of fixed costs through fixed charges and to better align time periods and prices with energy markets. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” and “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

- **Ongoing integrated resource planning.** SMUD monitors and updates its integrated resource planning to ensure future sources of energy balance cost, reliability and environmental requirements with the flexibility to meet challenges of changing market and regulatory conditions, customer energy resources, and emerging technologies.

**Leveraging Core Competencies**  
In addition to these initiatives, SMUD is leveraging core competencies to improve industry safety and help communities serve their customers’ energy needs.

![Sacramento Power Academy](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Sacramento Power Academy.** The Sacramento Power Academy is SMUD’s operational training center providing training support for all of SMUD’s skilled trades professionals. Operating on a 10-acre training facility the academy oversees SMUD’s 14 skilled trades apprenticeships. The academy’s experienced training professionals serve as liaisons and mentors to apprentices progressing through on-the-job training, program testing, night schooling, and extensive training components. The academy also ensures SMUD’s skilled trades professionals are safe and compliant by coordinating and delivering annual regulatory and safety training. The academy is also a workforce development hub utilized by SMUD to increase awareness of and interest in skilled trades careers at SMUD, in SMUD’s community, and in the utility industry.

**Community Energy Services.** In 2002, Assembly Bill 117 was passed to establish Community Choice Aggregation in the State by authorizing Community Choice Aggregators (“CCAs”) to aggregate customer electric load and purchase electricity for customers. SMUD’s Community Energy Services department was established in 2017 to support organizations with values closely aligned with SMUD’s values, while also generating additional revenue for SMUD. CCA programs are proliferating in the State thanks to support for expanding renewable energy use and desire for local control particularly for electricity procurement. There are numerous CCAs operating in the State, and more are anticipated to launch in the future. CCAs are responsible for procuring wholesale power, setting the generation rate, and staffing a call center to handle opt-outs and questions about the power portfolio. The local investor-owned utility (“IOU”) continues to deliver electricity from the electric grid, maintain its electric infrastructure, bill customers and collect payments.

In October 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Valley Clean Energy (“VCE”) to provide technical, energy and support services, including data management and call center services, wholesale energy services, and business operations support, to VCE for a term set to end in 2023. SMUD and VCE recently executed a new contract for data management, contact center, consulting and debt collection services that expires on December 31, 2028. VCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the City of Woodland, the City of Davis and Yolo County to implement a local CCA program. The service territory expanded to include the City of Winters in 2021. The mission of VCE is to deliver cost-competitive clean electricity, product choice, price stability, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions to its customers in Yolo County. VCE began electric services to its customers in the summer of 2018, giving Yolo County residents a choice between two electricity providers, VCE and PG&E.

In November 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of East Bay Community Energy (“EBCE”) to provide call center and data management services for a three-year term beginning in January 2018. SMUD signed a new contract with EBCE in January 2022 for call center and data management services for an additional three-year term. EBCE recently changed its name to Ava Community Energy (“Ava”). Ava is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro and Union City in Alameda County to implement a local CCA program. Ava expanded its territory to the cities of Pleasanton, Newark, and Tracy in April 2021.

In June 2019, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Silicon Valley Clean Energy (“SVCE”) to provide program services to help local SVCE communities reduce carbon pollution while delivering engaging customer experiences. SVCE programs are focused on grid integration, as well as electrifying transportation, buildings and homes. This contract was extended through September of 2024. In June 2023, SMUD was selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s concierge service vendor for three years. In December 2023, SMUD was again selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s programs administrator for five years. SVCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Campbell, Cupertino, Gilroy, Lost Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill,

Mountain View, Saratoga, Sunnyvale and Unincorporated Santa Clara County to implement a local CCA program.

In July 2022, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Marin Clean Energy (“MCE”) to provide data management, billing, data analytic and system assessment services to MCE. MCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2010 and represents 37 member communities across four Bay Area counties: Contra Costa, Marin, Napa and Solano.

In September 2022, SMUD was selected through a competitive process by the governing board of Sonoma Clean Power (“SCP”) to provide market research services to SCP. In January of 2023, SMUD was selected to provide strategic consulting services, providing recommendations related to programs and marketing. SCP is a joint powers agency that serves Sonoma and Mendocino counties.

While CCAs have had success in the State, they are susceptible to business, regulatory and other risks that could lead to a financial loss and/or result in a cessation of operations for the CCA. These risks could extend to a CCA’s counterparties, including SMUD. SMUD has made an effort to identify and mitigate potential counterparty risks to the extent possible in service agreements with the CCAs described above. SMUD may pursue opportunities to provide similar services to additional CCAs in the future. SMUD management does not expect its current arrangements to have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

## FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION

### Precipitation Variability

SMUD uses a precipitation measuring station located at Fresh Pond, California to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s Upper American River Project (the “UARP”) hydropower reservoir. As of January 31, 2024, precipitation at Fresh Pond, California totaled 21 inches for the October-September hydropower water supply period. This is 75% of the 50-year rolling median of 28 inches. Total reservoir storage in the UARP hydropower reservoirs was 238 thousand acre-feet as of January 31, 2024, which was about 63% of capacity and approximately 6% above the historical average. SMUD manages its reservoirs to maximize water storage going into the summer season, which preserves generating capacity during SMUD’s high load months and ensures that SMUD meets its UARP FERC license requirements, including requirements for recreational and environmental flows.

There can be wide swings in precipitation from year to year. In years with below average rainfall, SMUD may have to generate or purchase replacement energy at additional cost. To hedge against variations in the volume of energy received from SMUD-owned UARP hydroelectric resources, SMUD uses the HRSF to help offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

SMUD is also exposed to precipitation variability through its contract with the WAPA. In an average water year this contract provides roughly 661 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of power. WAPA’s actual deliveries are based on hydroelectric generation (minus energy used for pumping) at Central Valley Project reservoirs in Northern California, which varies based on annual precipitation patterns, water deliveries for agriculture, and flow requirements in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Unlike the UARP, SMUD does not monitor precipitation stations to approximate power deliveries under the WAPA contract, and instead relies on a forecast of power deliveries from WAPA. As of January 31, 2024, WAPA has forecasted power deliveries of 703 GWh for 2024, approximately 6% more than an average water year. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration.”

# Wildfires

## General
Wildfires in the State have become increasingly common and destructive. Frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased, and could further increase, the possibility of wildfires occurring in areas where SMUD maintains generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The number of diseased and dead trees has increased, and could further increase this possibility. As a result, SMUD faces an increased risk that it may be required to pay for wildfire related property damage or
<!-- Page 159 -->
![Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory)](https://example.com/image.png)

**Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory).** In 2018, the CPUC approved a new statewide fire map that identifies areas of elevated and extreme wildfire risk from utility-associated assets located throughout the State. SMUD directly participated in the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map. In connection with the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map, a peer review and a team of independent nationwide experts led by Cal Fire affirmed that SMUD’s electric service area is properly located outside of these elevated (“Tier 2”) and extreme (“Tier 3”) high fire threat areas; however, SMUD’s UARP facilities are located within both Tier 2 and Tier 3 areas. According to the CPUC, Tier 2 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an elevated wildfire risk from utility assets and Tier 3 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an extreme risk from utility assets. As of June 8, 2021, approximately 37 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 19 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. SMUD is also a member of TANC. As of July 2022, approximately 116.3 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 4.5 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. In accordance with its FERC license, SMUD adheres to a FERC-approved Fire Prevention and Response Plan for its UARP facilities. On May 17, 2018, in accordance with State law, SMUD’s Board of Directors determined that the UARP area may have a “significant risk of catastrophic wildfire” resulting from overhead electric facilities and that SMUD’s FERC-approved UARP Fire Prevention and Response Plan meets requirements for presenting wildfire mitigation measures to the Board for its approval.

**Wildfire Mitigation.** In response to potential wildfire risk, SMUD has implemented and is continuing to implement a series of measures intended to prevent wildfires from occurring, minimize the spread of any fire that does occur and improve the resiliency of its system. These measures include an increase in the number of inspections of fuel reduction inside and adjacent to rights-of-ways, utilization of Cal Fire-approved operational material to reduce the risk of sparking; enhanced inspection and maintenance programs; increased use of ignition reduction techniques, including undergrounding of conductors; increased monitoring of identified responses to fire conditions, including operational procedures for the de-energization of lines during high fire conditions; and elimination of automatic reclosing on SMUD’s transmission lines and on SMUD’s distribution lines in certain areas during fire season.

SMUD’s proactive approach to vegetation management has been expanded to include the use of advanced technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (“LiDAR”), ortho and oblique imagery that is used to pinpoint tree health and/or condition that may not yet be visible to the naked eye. In addition, SMUD has installed additional weather stations in transmission corridors and substations for increased situational awareness and has continued coordination and collaboration with local agencies and first responders as well as vulnerable populations.

State legislation enacted in 2018 and 2019 (SB 901 and AB 1054, respectively) requires publicly owned utilities (“POUs”) to prepare and present Wildfire Mitigation Plans to their governing boards by January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter. SB 901 requires POUs, including SMUD, before January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, to prepare a wildfire mitigation plan and present it in a public meeting to their governing board. SB 901 requires POU’s to accept comments on the wildfire mitigation plan from the public, other local and State agencies, and interested parties, and to verify that the plan complies with all applicable rules, regulations, and standards, as appropriate. The bill requires a qualified independent evaluator to review and assess the comprehensiveness of its wildfire mitigation plan and present its report to the board in a public meeting. AB 1054 created a new Wildfire Safety Division within the CPUC to prioritize wildfire safety throughout the State, and established an appointed Wildfire Safety Advisory Board (“WSAB”) to advise and make recommendations relating to wildfire safety to this new Division. For POUs, the bill requires submittal of annual wildfire mitigation plans to the WSAB for review and advisory opinions relating to the content and sufficiency of the plans.

A-18
<!-- Page 160 -->
SMUD assembled an enterprise-wide team of subject-matter experts to prepare its plan in compliance with this legislation. SMUD’s initial Wildfire Mitigation Plan (“WMP”) was adopted by the Board in the fourth quarter of 2019, after circulation for public comment and review of the comprehensiveness of the plan by a qualified independent evaluator. The WMP and evaluator’s report were submitted to the WSAB in 2020.

SMUD reviews its WMP each year, presenting the updated plan to the Board for adoption at duly noticed public meetings. The updated plans and evaluator reports are submitted to the WSAB for advisory opinion and recommendations. SMUD responds to the WSAB’s comments regarding SMUD’s WMP as part of its WMP process. SMUD will continue to annually review and update its WMP, conducting a comprehensive review at least every third year.

SMUD recently completed a comprehensive review and update of its WMP after soliciting public input and independent evaluation. The 2023-2025 WMP was adopted by the Board on June 15, 2023, and duly submitted to the WSAB.

**Wildfire Insurance.** Wildfires both in California and nationally have not only increased potential liability for utilities, but have also adversely impacted the insurance markets, leading to higher costs for coverage; coverages becoming prohibitively expensive; limited or restricted coverage to certain types of risks; or coverage at insufficient levels. SMUD most recently renewed its general and wildfire liability insurance coverage on June 15, 2023, increasing the coverage limit by $25 million to $275 million. SMUD increased the commercially insured portion of its wildfire coverage program from $176 million to $212.5 million and maintained the self-insured layers and quota share portions of the coverage at $6.5 million.

In addition, it is expected that SMUD will be able to access a portion of the $500 million aggregate amount of its commercial paper and line of credit program to provide operational flexibility in the event of the occurrence of a wildfire or other operational event. However, SMUD has not covenanted to maintain the availability of the commercial paper program and line of credit program for these purposes and no assurances can be given that the commercial paper and line of credit program will be available at the time of, or during, such an event.

**August 2020 Heat Wave**

The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from August 14, 2020 through August 18, 2020. The CAISO was forced to institute rotating electricity outages in the State during this extreme heat wave. SMUD, as a member of BANC, and being outside of the CAISO did not have to implement any planned power disruptions. Additionally, SMUD was able to support the CAISO during some hours of the heat wave with both requested emergency assistance and wholesale market sales. SMUD’s peak demand between August 14, 2020 and August 18, 2020, varied between 2,874 MW and 3,057 MW, well below SMUD’s record peak of 3,299 MW.

**September 2022 Heat Wave**

The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from September 5, 2022 through September 8, 2022. On September 6, 2022, SMUD experienced its second highest peak demand of 3,263 MW. SMUD did not have to implement any planned power disruptions.

**Storm Damage**

In January 2023, SMUD experienced a series of winter storms that brought heavy rains and high winds causing damage to SMUD’s grid and widespread outages for SMUD’s customers. By the time the  
A-19

**storm response was complete, SMUD had experienced the largest mobilization of personnel and restoration crews in its history. SMUD incurred costs related to removing downed trees, restoring power from downed poles and broken lines, replenishing inventory, communicating with and providing assistance to customers, maintaining IT systems, and coordinating with local emergency agencies. SMUD is pursuing claims with Federal and State agencies to attempt to recover certain of SMUD’s costs related to the storms. The material financial impacts have been reflected in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, [which are included in APPENDIX B].**

**Cosumnes Power Plant Outage**

On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant (as defined herein) was shut down due to a ground fault in the Steam Turbine Generator (“STG”) stator. The ground fault was caused by delamination of the insulation on one of the through bolts. Damage from the ground fault resulted in a full rewind and restack of the stator core, replacement of all stator through bolts, and a full rewind of turbine rotor. The Cosumnes Power Plant repairs were completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. During the extended outage, SMUD shifted generation to the other local gas-fired plants and the Sutter Energy Center and procured additional energy and resource adequacy capacity. SMUD also requested and received approval from the California Air Quality Board and California Energy Commission to operate one or both of the gas turbines without the STG. During the September 2022 heatwave, both of the gas turbines at the Cosumnes Power Plant were operated without the STG, providing 270 MW at peak.

To mitigate the financial impact of unplanned outages from its thermal assets, SMUD carries commercial property insurance with a business interruption endorsement. At the time of the loss, the coverage provided up to $30.8 million of business interruption recovery per month at the Cosumnes Power Plant, with a sub-limit of $310 million over any 18-month period. During the period of loss, claims were subject to a $5 million equipment damage deductible and a 60-day business interruption claims waiting period.

SMUD has settled the equipment damage portion of the loss for $18.6 million, resulting in a $13.6 million recovery. The business interruption portion of the claim remains in process, with SMUD receiving a $50 million advance in December of 2022. As of January 2024, the carriers have confirmed an additional $51 million in undisputed recovery, which is anticipated to be received in the first quarter of 2024. Thus far, SMUD has recovered $114.6 million of the loss and will continue to work toward full settlement of the disputed portion of the claim, which is approximately $68 million.

**Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic**

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD has lessened since the height of the pandemic in 2020, SMUD is still experiencing impacts from the pandemic. However, compared to weather adjusted load levels, SMUD’s overall load is near or above pre-pandemic levels.

Part of the governmental response to the economic consequences of the pandemic required utility providers (including SMUD) to provide additional grace periods and flexible payment plans for the payment of utility bills or to refrain from pursuing collection remedies for unpaid bills for a period of time. SMUD also implemented a no-shutoff policy through January 2022 under which SMUD did not disconnect power to a customer for non-payment of their electric bill. Beginning in February 2022, SMUD resumed its normal payment, late fee, and disconnection process and began disconnections of unpaid accounts in late April 2022. As a result, SMUD has experienced an increase in delinquencies for customer electric accounts versus pre-pandemic levels. In December 2021, SMUD received $41 million from the California Arrearage Payment Program (“CAPP”) initial funding, and an additional $9.9 million in 2022. All funds were applied to delinquent balances. As of December 31, 2023, the total delinquencies for customer electric

**A-20**
<!-- Page 162 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

accounts were $38.2 million, after the CAPP credit, which is an increase from the February 2020 balance of total delinquencies for customer electric accounts of $16.9 million. The financial impacts stemming from delinquent accounts have been accounted for in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the preceding years. Any successful recovery of delinquent accounts will contribute to an increase in net income.

SMUD also paused the recertification process for existing customers in SMUD’s low-income discount program during the pandemic. The number of customers participating in the low-income assistance program increased by 16,407, or approximately 22% from February 2020 to December 2023. SMUD has resumed the recertification process for existing customers in the low-income discount program in 2023.

While the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD have lessened, if the pandemic and its consequences again become more severe or another similar event occurs, the impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations could be material.

## RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE

### Rates and Charges

SMUD’s Board of Directors has autonomous authority to establish the rates charged for all SMUD services. Unlike IOUs and some other municipal utility systems, retail rate and revenue levels are not subject to review or regulation by any other federal, State or local governmental agencies. Changes to SMUD rates only require formal action by the Board of Directors after two public workshops and a public hearing. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government. SMUD typically reviews and sets rates on a two-year cycle.

### 2019 Rate Action

On June 24, 2019, the Board approved a 3.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2020, a 3.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2020, a 2.50% rate increase effective January 1, 2021, and a 2.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2021, for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved a restructuring of the commercial rates, including new time periods and an overall increase in the fixed bill components, such as the System Infrastructure Fixed Charge and demand charges, and a corresponding decrease in energy charges, making the restructuring revenue neutral by rate category. To minimize bill impacts, rate categories will be restructured over an eight-year period.

### 2021 Rate Action

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved a 1.5% rate increase effective March 1, 2022 and a 2.0% rate increase effective January 1, 2023 for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved the Solar and Storage Rate, the optional residential Peak Pricing Rate, and updates to certain schedules of SMUD’s Open Access Transmission Tariff (“OATT”). The Board also approved a new timeline for the commercial rate restructure transition, and all impacted commercial customers were transitioned to the new rates by the end of the first quarter of 2022.

SMUD also implemented a solar interconnection fee based on the size of solar interconnection and supporting programs such as battery incentives, incentives to enroll in SMUD’s Peak Pricing Rate, battery incentives for Virtual Power Plants, and a program to bring the benefits of solar to under-resourced multi-family communities. These programs and fees are not subject to Board approval.
<!-- Page 163 -->
![2023 Rate Action](https://example.com/image.png)

**2023 Rate Action**

On September 21, 2023, the Board approved a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2025, and a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2025 for all customer classes. The Board also approved establishing the Energy Assistance Program Rate (“EAPR”) Rate Stabilization Fund, which will provide an additional discount to those low-income customers with the greatest need. The discount will be funded with discretionary, non-retail rate revenue, as to not have an impact on any future required rate changes. There is currently pending litigation concerning the adoption of the 2023 rates. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”

**Rate Stabilization Funds**

The Rate Stabilization Fund (“RSF”) is maintained by SMUD to reduce the need for future rate increases when costs exceed existing rates. At the direction of the Board, amounts may be either transferred into the RSF (which reduces revenues) or transferred out of the RSF (which increases revenues). The Board authorizes RSF transfers on an event driven basis. The RSF includes funds to hedge variations in the volume of energy received from WAPA hydroelectric generation, variation in AB 32 revenue and variations in Low Carbon Fuel Credit (“LCFS”) revenue. As of December 31, 2023, the balance in the RSF was $115.8 million, which is approximately 7.2% of annual retail revenue.

Effective July 2008, SMUD implemented the HGA, which is a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from the UARP (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric”). The HGA is designed to increase the deposits to the HRSF in wet years when SMUD has more hydroelectric generation than expected. Each year SMUD determines the impact of precipitation variances on projected hydroelectric generation from the UARP. When the precipitation variance results in a deficiency of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, transfers from the HRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is zero. When the precipitation variance results in a projected surplus of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, deposits will be made into the HRSF in an amount approximating the positive impact to SMUD from the surplus hydroelectric generation (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is not sufficient to cover transfers that would otherwise be made in the event of a projected deficiency in UARP hydroelectric generation, a 12-month HGA surcharge will automatically be included on customers’ electric bills at a level that generates up to 4% of retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue on any precipitation variance calculation date and the precipitation variance results in a projected UARP hydroelectric generation surplus, the positive impact of the surplus may be used for other purposes at staff’s recommendation, with the approval of the Board, including returned to customers through an electric bill discount up to 4% of retail revenue. SMUD calculates HRSF transfers based on an April-March (water year) precipitation period at Fresh Pond, California. This precipitation station is used to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s UARP hydropower reservoirs. As of January 31, 2024, and based on the current HRSF water year precipitation forecast, SMUD anticipates transferring $20.8 million out of the HRSF in April 2024.

In September 2023, SMUD added a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from WAPA. Each year SMUD determines the WAPA Energy Delivery Variance (“EDV”) based on forecasted energy delivery minus the actual energy delivery. When the EDV variance is positive, transfers from the WRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 2% of cash).

**Low-Income Discount**

As of December 2023, approximately 91,407 customers received the low-income discount offered by SMUD, which represents approximately 16% of all residential customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, SMUD suspended recertification during the pandemic. In 2023, the total discount was approximately $32.7 million. As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn, SMUD experienced an increase in low-income discount applicants. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

While the low-income discount has provided substantial benefits to low-income customer bills for years, multiple economic variables, such as inflation and rate increases, have had disproportionately negative impacts on low-income customers, particularly those in the 0-50% Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”). In 2023, SMUD established an EAPR Rate Stabilization Fund (“ERSF”) to provide an additional discount to the electricity usage charge up to an established maximum discount (“ERSF Additional Discount”) for customers in the 0-50% FPL. The ERSF is funded by discretionary non-retail rate revenue, reviewed on an annual basis, and the specific monthly ERSF Additional Discount is set before the year the value is in effect. SMUD expanded its programs and services starting in 2016 to help customers with energy assistance, home improvement packages, and education. SMUD is creating tailored solutions to best meet the needs of low-income customers. These solutions include free solar panels and inspecting homes to identify energy saving and fuel switching opportunities. As of December 2023, SMUD has performed 30,000 energy retrofits and, in partnership with Grid Alternatives (a non-profit organization that focuses on implementing solar power and energy efficiency for low-income families), 230 customers have benefited from free solar installations. Forty-eight additional homes received solar and energy efficiency through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento. As part of SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan and the focus on building electrification, SMUD has also been ramping up electrification investments for low-income customers. Additionally, since 2019, SMUD has assisted more than 2,600 households with electrification upgrades. Furthermore, SMUD has installed nearly 450 electric vehicle chargers and more than 400 electric vehicle circuits in low-income households or areas that serve low-income customers.

# Customer Base: Largest Customers

A stabilizing influence on SMUD’s revenues is that a substantial proportion is derived from residential customers (49.2% in 2023). Historically, revenue from commercial and industrial consumption has been more sensitive to economic fluctuation. Furthermore, SMUD has no dominant customers that account for a significant percentage of annual revenues. In 2023, no single customer contributed more than 3% of revenues. The top ten customers generated approximately 9% of revenues and the top 30 generated approximately 15% of revenues. The following table presents information on SMUD’s top ten customers as of December 31, 2023.

# Power Generation Facilities

## Hydroelectric
The UARP consists of three relatively large storage reservoirs (Union Valley, Loon Lake and Ice House) with an aggregate water storage capacity of approximately 400,000 acre-feet and eight small reservoirs. Project facilities also include eight tunnels with a combined length of over 26 miles and eight powerhouses containing 11 turbines. In addition to providing clean hydroelectric power and operating flexibility for SMUD, the UARP area provides habitat for fish and wildlife and a variety of recreational opportunities, including camping, fishing, boating, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and cross-country skiing.

The combined capacity of the UARP is approximately 685 MW at SMUD’s load center in Sacramento. Under current licensing and mean water conditions, these facilities are expected to generate approximately 1,600 GWh of electric energy annually, which represents approximately 15% of SMUD’s current average annual retail energy requirements. In 1957, the Federal Power Commission (predecessor agency to FERC) issued a license to SMUD for the UARP. This 50-year license was subsequently amended to add and upgrade facilities and now includes all segments of SMUD’s hydroelectric facilities located on the South Fork of the American River and its tributaries upstream from the Chili Bar Project (described below). On July 23, 2014, FERC issued to SMUD a new 50-year license for the UARP.

On November 9, 2016 FERC issued an Order authorizing SMUD to construct the South Fork Powerhouse downstream of the UARP’s Slab Creek Dam. Construction was substantially completed in the fall of 2020, and the new powerhouse was placed into operation on October 25, 2022, adding 1.8 MW of generation to the UARP’s overall capacity.

On June 16, 2021, pursuant to Board authorization, SMUD approved the Chili Bar Hydroelectric Project which consists of a 7 MW powerhouse, reservoir, dam and spillway, north of Placerville on the South Fork of the American River for approximately $10.4 million (the “Chili Bar Project”). The Chili Bar Project is immediately downstream from the UARP and operates as the regulating reservoir for the UARP’s largest powerhouse. Owning the UARP and the Chili Bar Project enables SMUD to operate the two projects with a holistic approach to license compliance and generation efficiency.

## Solano 2 Wind Project
SMUD owns and operates an 87 MW wind project, located in Solano County, known as Solano 2. Solano 2 consists of 29 wind turbine generators (“WTGs”) rated at 3.0 MW. Energy from the project is collected at 21 kV and transmitted over a dedicated 3-mile overhead system to the SMUD-owned Russell substation. At the Russell facility, the energy is transformed to 230 kV and interconnected to PG&E’s Birds Landing Switching Station. Energy deliveries are scheduled through the CAISO.

## Solano 3 Project
In 2011 and 2012, SMUD constructed a 128 MW wind project adjacent to Solano Phase 2, known as Solano 3. The Solano 3 project consists of 31 WTGs rated at 1.8 MW and 24 WTGs rated at 3.0 MW. The project interconnects through a 34.5 kV underground collection system to the Russell substation. Like the Solano Phase 2 project, this energy is transformed to 230 kV and delivered through the CAISO.

## Solano 4 Project
SMUD has developed the Solano 4 Wind Project on land with a wind easement owned by SMUD near the Solano 3 project, known as the Collinsville and Roberts properties, to install 10 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW, and to remove the Solano 1 turbines and replace them with 9 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW. SMUD has met all of the CAISO requirements and has executed a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement (“GLIA”) as of June 2021 that will allow for 90.8 MW of capacity at the point of interconnection. In April 2021, SMUD submitted an application for advisory review by the Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (the “Solano ALUC”) of the Solano 4 Wind Project’s consistency.

with the 2015 Travis Air Force Base Land Use Compatibility Plan (the “Travis Plan”). In May 2021, the Solano ALUC purported to resolve that the Solano 4 Wind Project was inconsistent with the Travis Plan. In August 2021, the Board approved the Project Environmental Impact Report, made findings overriding the Solano ALUC’s finding of inconsistency, made findings there was no alternative to the project, and approved the Solano 4 Wind Project. In September 2021, Solano County filed a writ petition challenging SMUD’s approval of the Solano 4 Wind Project based on procedural, environmental, zoning and land use grounds. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 14, 2022, and the suit was dismissed on January 10, 2023. The settlement agreement allows for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project as planned.

In addition, SMUD applied for and obtained extensions of the Federal Aviation Administration Determinations of No Hazard allowing for construction of the turbines. A contract for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project was awarded to Vestas Corporation and the Solano 4 Wind Project is currently under construction. The expected operation date for the Solano 4 Wind Project is May 2024. PG&E identified upgrades needed to interconnect the Solano 4 Wind Project that will not be complete before the expected Solano 4 commercial operation date. PG&E has an approved project and expects to complete the needed upgrades by May of 2025. Realization of the full capacity of the Solano 4 Wind Project may be delayed into the second quarter of 2025 due to the timeframe established for the PG&E required transmission upgrades. SMUD has developed a mitigation plan for the limited interconnection capacity for the first year of operation, in coordination with CAISO and PG&E, of using all of the existing SMUD Solano Russell substation interconnection capacity combined for the dispatch of all the Solano Wind Project. SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process, which combines all phases of the Solano Wind Project so it may operate as one project. This was fully executed by SMUD, CAISO, and PG&E on February 27, 2023.

As of the end of 2023, all of the turbine site delivery roads and foundations for the Solano 4 Project have been completed, and all of the turbine components have been delivered to the Solano 4 Project site and 10 of the Solano 4 Project turbines have been fully erected.

At the completion of the Solano 4 project, SMUD will have an installed wind capacity of 303 MW in connection with the overall Solano Wind Project, leaving 18 MW at the point of interconnection for future development.

**Distributed Solar Photovoltaic.** SMUD owns and operates approximately 2 MW of solar photovoltaic generating facilities. These facilities include installations at the Hedge Substation property, SMUD Headquarters, the East Campus Operations Center, and other smaller photovoltaic systems throughout the service area on parking lots.

**Hedge Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 4 MW, 8 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached commercial operation in January 2023.

**ESS Flow Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 0.45 MW, 3 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached test operation in September 2023, and commercial operation is planned for March 2024.

**Local Gas-Fired Plants.** SMUD constructed five local natural gas-fired plants in its service area: the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, the Campbell Soup Project, McClellan and the Cosumnes Power Plant (each defined below). These five plants are referred to collectively as the “Local Gas-Fired Plants.” These plants are a strategic component of SMUD’s resource mix. In addition to providing SMUD a total capacity of approximately 1,139 MW, the Local Gas-Fired Plants provide SMUD with needed

**Local Gas-Fired Plants Overview**

SMUD has entered into long-term agreements with SFA providing for the purchase by SMUD of all of the power from each of the Local Gas-Fired Plants on a take-or-pay basis. This consolidation created operational and administrative efficiencies without changing any of the functionality of the power plants. Although the Local Gas-Fired Plants are owned by SFA, SMUD has exclusive control of their dispatch and manages their operations as part of its overall power supply strategy.

Payments under the power purchase agreements are payable from the revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of the principal of or interest on SMUD’s Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the caption “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below), as are other maintenance and operation costs and energy payments. For further discussion of SMUD’s obligations to make these payments to SFA, see “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Joint Powers Authorities.”

**Description of the Five Local Gas-Fired Plants:**

1. **The Cosumnes Power Plant (the “Cosumnes Power Plant”)**  
   The Cosumnes Power Plant is a 612 MW natural gas-fired, combined cycle plant located in the southern portion of Sacramento County adjacent to SMUD’s decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant. Commercial operation of the Cosumnes Power Plant commenced on February 24, 2006. SFA increased the net generating capacity of the facility by 81 MWs via an Advanced Gas Path (“AGP”) upgrade. The additional AGP generation was realized after hardware and software upgrades were completed. The Cosumnes Power Plant is owned by SFA, a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and MID. The existing take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA expires no earlier than when the related bonds have been paid in full (the outstanding related bonds are scheduled to mature on July 1, 2030). On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant was shut down due to a ground fault in the STG stator. The repair was completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Cosumnes Power Plant Outage”.

2. **The Carson Cogeneration Project (the “Carson Project”)**  
   The Carson Project, a 103 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project consisting of separate cycle and peaking plants, provides steam to the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) wastewater treatment plant adjacent to the site. The Carson Project was originally owned by the Central Valley Financing Authority (“CVFA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and the SRCSD. Construction of the Carson Project was completed and the plant began commercial operation on October 11, 1995. The CVFA bonds issued to finance the Carson Project were defeased in September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Carson Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

3. **The Procter & Gamble Cogeneration Project (the “Procter & Gamble Project”)**  
   The Procter & Gamble Project, a 182 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, is located in an established industrial area of Sacramento. The initial combined cycle portion of the plant began commercial operation on March 1, 1997. Construction of the peaking plant portion of the Procter & Gamble Project commenced during 2000 and the unit achieved commercial status on April 24, 2001. The Procter & Gamble Project produces steam for use in Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company’s oleochemical manufacturing processes and electricity for sale to SMUD. The Procter & Gamble Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Cogeneration Authority (“SCA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA, a separate joint powers authority. The SCA bonds issued to finance the Procter & Gamble Project were defeased in
<!-- Page 173 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Procter & Gamble Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Procter & Gamble Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

**The Campbell Soup Cogeneration Project (the “Campbell Soup Project”).** The Campbell Soup Project, a 170 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project, was completed and began commercial operations on December 4, 1997. Upgrades were implemented during 2000, which increased the plant’s peaking capacity to 180 MW, well above its net demonstrated capacity of 159.8 MW. The plant is located in south Sacramento adjacent to the Capital Commerce Center (formerly the Campbell Soup Company food processing facility). The Campbell Soup Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Power Authority (“SPA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA. The SPA bonds issued to finance the Campbell Soup Project were redeemed in July 2015. In late 2021, ownership of the Campbell Soup Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Campbell Soup Project (the “Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA”) covers both the Campbell Soup Project and McClellan and will be in effect until terminated by SMUD. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing the Campbell Soup Project in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**The McClellan Gas Turbine (“McClellan”).** McClellan is a 72 MW natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine generating plant at McClellan Business Park in Sacramento. This turbine is connected to SMUD’s electric system and is operated to meet SMUD’s peak-load requirements. McClellan is aligned for remote starting and operation with black start and fast start capabilities. SMUD constructed the McClellan unit in 1986 as a 50 MW emergency power source for the McClellan Air Force Base. In 2001, following the Air Force base closure, McClellan was repurposed for SMUD’s use. In May 2007, SMUD transferred ownership of McClellan to SPA for more efficient operation. SPA did not issue debt related to McClellan. In late 2021, ownership of McClellan was transferred to SFA. SFA pays all costs of operations and maintenance through to SMUD in accordance with the terms of the Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA. In exchange for paying all costs related to McClellan, SMUD receives all of the power generated thereby on a take-or-pay basis. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing McClellan in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**Fuel Supply**

**General.** SMUD is obligated to arrange for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Management of the natural gas procurement and delivery process is a key focus of SMUD’s reliability and risk policies. Although the natural gas consumption of the power plants for SMUD’s load can vary significantly depending on the season, precipitation, and the market price of power and natural gas, the plants are forecasted to need, on average in 2024, a total of approximately 91,000 Decatherms per day (“Dth/day”) with a daily peak slightly more than 171,000 Dth/day of natural gas. SMUD has implemented a comprehensive strategy to secure a reliable and diversified fuel supply through a variety of agreements for the supply, transportation, and storage of natural gas.

**Supply.** SMUD hedges a significant portion of its expected gas needs to meet customer power requirements. This includes gas for the Local Gas-Fired Plants and for the Sutter Energy Center. See “Power Purchase Agreements – Sutter Energy Center”. This is accomplished through a combination of long-term supply arrangements and an exposure reduction program. The program consists of a primarily rolling three-year exposure reduction component, a fuel hedging component on a rolling three-year basis, as well as supplemental fixed calendar year components reaching out up to five calendar years. Long-term

A-32
<!-- Page 174 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

arrangements may consist of a combination of physical commodity supply contracts, financial hedges, or options. Natural gas is purchased from a wide variety of producers and marketers at the northern and southern California borders, and from the San Juan and the Rocky Mountain supply basins. SMUD has a number of both fixed-price supply agreements and financial hedging contracts to fix gas costs ranging from one month to several years in duration. Including fixed price biogas contracts as of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted.

SMUD has contracted with NCGA to purchase an approximate average of 8,700 Dth/day over the remaining life of a contract expiring May 31, 2027 (the “NCGA Contract”). Under the NCGA contract, SMUD pays a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. Until November 1, 2023 the delivery point for the NCGA Contract was the AECO hub in Alberta. Starting November 1, 2023, to increase delivery efficiencies, SMUD has exchanged the gas delivered at the AECO hub under the NCGA Contract with gas delivered at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border. From there SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants.

SMUD has also contracted with NCEA to purchase an approximately 22,000 Dth/day on average, or to be converted to the appropriate cash flow value in Megawatt-hours (“MWh”) of electricity over the remaining life of a contract expiring on May 31, 2049. The gas will be delivered to the SMUD system via the Malin receipt point on the PG&E backbone system. SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants. SMUD will pay a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. In connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement), SMUD expects to amend and restate the contract with NCEA in connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement.) [adjust for 2024 Senior Bonds offering documents]

**Renewable Natural Gas Supply.** As a component of meeting SMUD’s RPS goals, SMUD procures renewable natural gas and digesters gas as fuels to generate renewable electricity from the Cosumnes Power Plant. Descriptions of the renewable natural gas supply agreements are provided below.

In March 2009, SMUD entered into a 15-year contract (that qualifies as renewable energy) with Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (“Shell Energy”) to purchase up to 6,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from a landfill project in Texas. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in April 2009. In March 2012, SMUD amended the contract with Shell Energy to increase the maximum volumes to 7,300 Dth/day and extended the term by 10 years to March 31, 2034. Currently, the delivery point is PG&E Topock and SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In 2016, SMUD entered into a 3-year contract with Shell Energy to sell back the entire volume of renewable natural gas purchased, less 500 Dth/day, to be sold into the vehicle transportation markets. Upon expiration of the initial 3-year contract for the sale of biogas to Shell Energy, SMUD extended the sell back of the entire volume of biogas twice for an additional three years with Element Markets (now RNG, LLC), starting in 2020 and 2023. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

SMUD contracted with Heartland Renewable Energy, LLC (“HRE”) in December 2009 for a 20-year supply of up to 7,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas from a digester facility in Colorado. Deliveries began in March of 2014. Currently, the delivery point is Opal, Wyoming and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. HRE has not delivered volumes from the project to SMUD since December 2016 due to litigation with Weld County, Colorado regarding odor and
<!-- Page 175 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

permit issues. EDF Renewables, the majority owner of HRE, notified SMUD in August of 2017 that it is in discussions with a short list of bidders to sell its interests in the facility. In June of 2020, the project was purchased and SMUD’s contract was assigned to the new owner, Platte River Biogas, LLC (“PRB”). SMUD and PRB reached a settlement in the third quarter of 2021 that could lead to terminating the contract.

In September 2011, SMUD and CVFA entered into a “Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement” through which the Carson Project cleans nearly all of the digester gas received from Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) and sells it to SMUD for delivery to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In return, SMUD pays all of the Carson Project’s costs in acquiring, cleaning and making the gas available to SMUD. The Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, along with the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The Carson Project is currently receiving, processing and selling up to 1,500 Dth/day with provisions for volume increases over time to 2,500 Dth/day. Digester gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations.

In December 2011, SMUD entered into a 20-year agreement with EIF KC Landfill Gas LLC (“EIF”) to purchase up to 7,050 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from multiple landfill projects. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in January 2014. Currently the delivery point is Kern River – Opal and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. Renewable natural gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations. In April 2022, SMUD entered into a transaction to sell the renewable natural gas purchased into the renewable transportation markets. The transaction expires in March 2025. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

AB 2196 is a law that defines the criteria by which existing and future renewable natural gas contracts will qualify for the State RPS program. The CEC adopted a RPS Eligibility Guidebook on April 30, 2013, which includes detailed rules for implementation of AB 2196. SMUD received an updated certificate of eligibility from the CEC in July 2014 for the Cosumnes Power Plant that included the quantities of renewable natural gas from all contracts. The CEC adopted a revised RPS Eligibility Guidebook (Ninth Edition) on April 27, 2017. This latest guidebook did not change the RPS eligibility of any of the above SMUD renewable natural gas and digester gas contracts, but did simplify reporting requirements for these contracts.

Gas Transmission

SMUD has satisfied its obligation to deliver natural gas to its power plants by constructing a natural gas pipeline, purchasing an equity interest in two PG&E backbone gas transmission lines, and contracting for capacity on a number of existing interstate natural gas transmission lines.

The Local Pipeline. SMUD constructed and owns a 20-inch, 50-mile natural gas pipeline in the greater Sacramento area (the “Local Pipeline”) that transports gas to all of the Local Gas-Fired Plants except McClellan. The Local Pipeline is interconnected with PG&E’s major State gas transmission lines 300 and 401. Additionally, it may be interconnected with one or more private gas gathering pipelines located in the area, a gas storage project and/or other FERC approved pipelines that may be built in the local area. In conjunction with the construction of the Cosumnes Power Plant, SMUD extended the Local Pipeline to the plant site. The 26-mile extension was completed in 2004. The extension is 24 inches in diameter and was designed to serve both the Cosumnes Power Plant and an additional second phase, if constructed.

![PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401](https://example.com/image.png)

**PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401.** In 1996, SMUD purchased an equity interest in PG&E’s backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 (referred to as the PG&E backbone). The total capacity acquired at that time was approximately 85,000 Dth/day and consisted of approximately 43,600 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, Oregon and 44,700 Dth/day from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California. SMUD was also entitled to a share of non-firm capacity, which was approximately 4,360 Dth/day; making the total capacity potentially available to SMUD almost 90,000 Dth/day. This purchase made SMUD a co-owner of the PG&E backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 and obligated SMUD to pay PG&E to operate the pipelines on its behalf subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and operating protocols. PG&E reduced operating pressures on Line 300 after PG&E suffered a natural gas explosion in San Bruno, CA in September of 2010. Operating pressures and capacity may also fluctuate due to regulatory and other changes. As of December 1, 2021, SMUD holds a total capacity of approximately 87,000 Dth/day, consisting of approximately 47,572 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, and 39,193 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California.

**Kern River Gas Transmission Company Long Term Agreement.** SMUD has an agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company for 200,000 Dth/day of firm capacity through April 30, 2028. This capacity gives SMUD access to the Rocky Mountain supply basin at Opal, Wyoming, and connects to PG&E Line 300 (owned in part by SMUD) at Daggett, California.

SMUD’s diversified portfolio of gas transmission arrangements allows for the purchase of gas from a variety of suppliers and locations, and the opportunity to capitalize on regional price differentials where possible. In addition, it ensures diversity in the SMUD/PG&E backbone and better pipeline enhances the reliability of SMUD’s gas supply.

**Gas Storage**

SMUD also employs gas storage as part of its overall fuel supply strategy. Gas storage is useful in helping to balance gas supply, mitigate market price volatility, and provide a reliable supply to meet peak day delivery requirements.

SMUD has a contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2023 and expires in March 2026, for capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity.

SMUD also has a second contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2022 and expires in March 2024, for additional capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity. SMUD does not plan to renew this contract upon expiration.

SMUD has a contract with Wild Goose Storage LLC, that will begin in April 2024 (but which allows for early injection (December 2023 – March 2024)) for capacity in the Wild Goose Storage project located near Gridley in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 0.2 million Dth of storage inventory, ratcheted (12,500-14,000 Dth/day) volumes of injection rights and ratcheted (10,000 – 24,000 Dth/day) volumes of withdrawal capacity.

# Power Purchase Agreements

SMUD has a number of power purchase agreements to help meet its power requirements. Some of these agreements are described below.

## Western Area Power Administration
Effective January 1, 2005, SMUD entered into a 20-year contract with WAPA. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement extending the term by 30 years for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2054. Power sold under this contract is generated by the Central Valley Project (“CVP”), a series of federal hydroelectric facilities in northern California operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The contract provides WAPA’s CVP Base Resource customers (including SMUD) delivery of a percentage share of project generation in return for reimbursement of an equivalent share of project costs. SMUD’s CVP Base Resource share is roughly 25% of project generation and costs. This is expected to be approximately 318 MW of capacity and 661 GWh of energy in an average water year but will vary depending on precipitation. Energy available under the contract is determined by water releases required for water supply and flood control and is then shaped into higher value periods within other CVP operating constraints. More capacity and energy are typically available in spring and summer months and less in fall and winter.

SMUD also has a contract with WAPA expiring December 31, 2024, by which WAPA delivers an additional 200-300 MW per hour from projects located in the Pacific Northwest based on certain contractual parameters. In 2022, SMUD received 1,913 GWh of energy under this contract. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement for the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2030.

## Avangrid (formerly Iberdrola Renewables (“Iberdrola”))
SMUD has a contract with Iberdrola for 126 GWh of wind power generated in Solano County, California. The SMUD Board approved an extension of the wind contract through June 30, 2025.

## Patua Project LLC
In April 2010, SMUD entered into a power purchase agreement with Patua Project LLC (“Patua”), a subsidiary of Gradient Resources, for the delivery of up to 132 MW (expected to be 120 MW nominal power output) of renewable energy from geothermal generation being developed in north central Nevada, from a Gradient Resources project known as the Patua Project. The Patua Project was to have been developed in three phases. Since 2010, the agreed upon capacity has been reduced several times. In December 2013, Phase 1 of the project, which had been reduced to 30 MW, finally achieved commercial operation. In 2014, the parties concluded negotiations on the fourth amendment to the power purchase agreement with Patua, which reduced the total capacity down to 40 MW, extended the commercial operation date of Phase 2 to January 1, 2016, and allowed Patua to add up to 13 MW of solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production. In addition, this amendment shifted responsibility to Patua for a portion of the long-term transmission service agreements that have been underutilized due to the project not meeting its targets. In November 2015, the Patua Project was acquired by TL Power, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cyrq Energy, Inc. (“Cyrq”). In December 2015, Cyrq terminated Phase 2. Upon termination of Phase 2, the contractual right for Cyrq to add solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production was reduced to 10 MW. As a result of poor performance during the first year of operation, SMUD reduced its obligation to take power from 30 MW to 25 MW. Performance continued to lag in 2015 and 2016 and SMUD further reduced its obligation to take power from 25 MW to 19 MW.

## Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff
In September 2009, SMUD’s Board authorized a feed-in tariff program for the purchase of renewable energy from local renewable energy projects connected to SMUD’s distribution system. SMUD’s Board authorized connection of up to 100 MW under the feed-in tariff which included standard payment rates and standard purchase terms for power. The feed-in tariff program became effective on January 1, 2010. Under the feed-in tariff, SMUD has executed 20-year term power purchase agreements. 

A-36

agreements for solar projects totaling 98.5 MW. Construction and start-up were completed on all projects between 2010 and 2012.

**CalEnergy LLC.** In August 2014, SMUD entered into a 22-year power purchase agreement with CalEnergy LLC for the purchase of 30 MW per year of renewable energy from its Salton Sea geothermal facilities. As of July 1, 2017, SMUD began receiving up to 10 MW from the CalEnergy portfolio, which escalated to the full 30 MWs on May 1, 2020.

**Rancho Seco Solar.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Rancho Seco Solar LLC for the purchase of energy from a 10.88 MW solar PV project sited on SMUD’s property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Commercial operation was achieved in August of 2016. Rancho Seco Solar LLC leased the property from SMUD under a land lease agreement. The output of this project directly serves two large commercial customers that executed agreements with SMUD for retail supply of solar power.

In May 2019, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement for an additional 160 MW solar PV project with Rancho Seco Solar II, LLC. The project is located on SMUD-owned property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, adjacent to the existing 10.88 MW solar PV project. Construction began in 2019, and the project became commercially operable in February 2021.

**Grady Wind Energy.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Grady Wind Energy LLC (“Grady”) for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW wind project located in New Mexico (the “Grady Project”). The Grady Project began commercial operations on August 5, 2019. Energy from the Grady Project is delivered to CAISO. SMUD purchases 100% of the Grady Project output, which includes energy, renewable energy credits, and capacity attributes.

**Great Valley Solar 2, LLC.** In January 2017, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Great Valley Solar 2, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 60 MW solar PV project located in Fresno County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was December 28, 2017.

**ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC.** On September 14, 2016, Senate Bill 859 (“SB 859”) was signed into law. Under SB 859, a POU must procure its proportionate share of 125 MW of renewable energy from biomass plants burning high hazard forest fuels, subject to terms of at least five years. Seven POUs (SMUD, MID, Turlock Irrigation District (“TID”), Anaheim Public Utilities, Imperial Irrigation District, and Angeles Department of Water & Power and Riverside Public Utilities, collectively described herein as the “ARP-Loyalton POUs”) jointly solicited proposals for up to 29 MW of contract capacity for renewable energy to meet the requirements of SB 859. In January 2018, SMUD entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC to fulfill 18 MW of the required 29 MW with SMUD’s share being just over 23 percent (the “ARP-Loyalton PPA”). See “—Roseburg Forest Products Co.” below for a discussion of the remaining SB 859 capacity. The contract became effective on April 1, 2018. On February 18, 2020, ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and stopped producing and selling energy from the biomass plant. On May 7, 2022, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the Loyalton facility to Sierra Valley Enterprises, LLC (“SVE”). SVE initially expressed interest in bringing the facility back into service; however, the bankruptcy trustee requested requested extension of the deadline for SVE to accept or reject the ARP-Loyalton PPA. The latest deadline was April 19, 2023, the date of expiration of the ARP-Loyalton PPA terms. SVE did not resume operations before the end of the ARP-Loyalton PPA term, the ARP-Loyalton POUs have negotiated a settlement agreement with the bankruptcy trustee (the “ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement”). The ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement, which SMUD executed and is filed with the court, defines funds from the performance security that the ARP-Loyalton POUs will keep to cover legal and administrative fees, along with a contingency amount to cover potential risk of future damages. Since the ARP-Loyalton POUs entered into a five-year agreement to

procure compliant biomass and provided SVE the opportunity to accept the ARP-Loyalton PPA and restart operations, the ARP-Loyalton POUs consider their statutory obligations to have been fulfilled.

**Roseburg Forest Products Co.** For the remaining SB 859 biomass obligation of 11 MW, SMUD and the other ARP-Loyalton POUs have entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with Roseburg Forest Products Co. SMUD’s share of the contract capacity is 2.5795 MW, and the plant began operating under the contract on February 26, 2021.

**Sutter Energy Center.** SMUD entered into an initial two-year contract (with a third-year exercisable option) with Calpine Energy Services, L.P. (“Calpine”) for the ability to schedule up to 258 MW of energy from Sutter Energy Center. The Sutter Energy Center is a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle facility located in Yuba City, California. The initial contract became effective on April 1, 2018. SMUD exercised its option to extend the contract, which expired November 1, 2020. SMUD entered into a new contract with Calpine for the same 258 MW of energy that became effective January 1, 2021, and had an original expiration date of January 1, 2024. In December 2021, SMUD extended this contract through December 31, 2026.

**Drew Solar, LLC.** In June 2018, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Drew Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 100 MW solar PV project located in Imperial County, California. The project’s scheduled commercial operation date was set to be December 31, 2021. The commercial operation date was delayed due to Force Majeure claims surrounding the COVID pandemic and supply chain constraints caused by changes in Federal regulatory requirements. The project began commercially operating on November 3, 2022.

**Wildflower Solar, LLC.** In October 2018, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Wildflower Solar I, LLC, for the purchase of energy, capacity, and RECs from a 13 MW solar PV project located in Rio Linda, California. The project began commercially operating on December 18, 2020.

**Coyote Creek (Formerly Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC.)** In August 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW solar PV and 100 MW four-hour Battery Energy Storage System (“BESS”) capacity project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but has been delayed to 2026 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

**SloughHouse Solar, LLC.** In September 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with SloughHouse Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 50 MW solar PV project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but the commercial operation date has been delayed to March 31, 2025 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

# Transmission Service Agreements

## TANC California-Oregon Transmission Project
The 340-mile COTP is one part of a three 500-kV line coordinated system known as the California-Oregon Intertie (“COI”). The COTP is allocated one-third of the 4,800 MW capability of the COI system (see related agreements below). TANC is entitled to 1,390 MW and is obligated to pay approximately 80% of the operating costs of the COTP. SMUD is a member of TANC and a party to Project Agreement No. 3 (“PA3”), under which it is entitled to 378 MW and obligated to pay on an unconditional take-or-pay basis about 27.5% of TANC’s COTP debt service and operations costs, subject to a “step-up” obligation of up to 25% of its entitlement share upon the unremedied default of another TANC member-participant. In 2009, SMUD entered into a long-term layoff agreement with certain members that increased SMUD’s entitlement by 35 MW. In 2014, SMUD entered into another long-term layoff agreement with certain other members that increased SMUD’s COTP entitlements by 128 MW and amended the 2009 layoff agreement that returned 13 MW to a member. In January 2024, SMUD entered into an agreement to extend the 2009 long-term layoff agreement with certain members to January 31, 2034. As of January 31, 2024, SMUD was entitled to approximately 528 MW of TANC’s transfer capability for imports and 405 MW for exports, and is obligated to pay approximately 38.6% of COTP debt service and operations costs. SMUD’s payments under this contract, like SMUD’s payments under its other power purchase and transmission service agreements, are treated as “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the resolutions securing the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the section “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below). SMUD relies on its COTP rights to purchase power, access contingency reserves through the Western Power Pool, and obtain renewable resources to supplement its own resources to serve its load. TANC maintains insurance coverage on a per unit/casualty insurance program. TANC’s budget for COTP costs, support services and advocacy expenses is about $45.4 million for 2023. SMUD’s obligation on the TANC budget is about $8.5 million for 2023.

## TANC Tesla-Midway Transmission Service
TANC has a long-term contract with PG&E to provide TANC with 300 MW of transmission service between PG&E’s Midway Substation and the electric systems of the TANC Members (the “Tesla-Midway Service”). SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service had been 46 MW. As part of the 2009 long-term layoff agreement, SMUD acquired an additional 2 MW of South-of-Tesla Principles (“SOTP”) transmission rights for 15 years starting February, 2009 from another TANC member, bringing SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service to 48 MW.

## Bonneville Power Administration
In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration (“BPA”) for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service from BPA’s Hilltop substation in northeastern California to the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua geothermal project over BPA’s 230kV transmission lines. In early 2013, in accordance with BPA’s transmission tariff, the transmission service was split into two 30 MW services and deferred as appropriate to better fit the timing of expected commercial operation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Patua Project LLC.” SMUD submitted another request for the 30 MW of transmission procured for Phase 2 of the Patua Project to split the service into a 10 MW and a 20 MW service, with the 10 MW service deferred and timed with the originally expected commercial operation date of Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 1 of the Patua Project and SMUD’s reduced obligation due to the poor performance of Phase 1 of the Patua Project, much of the transmission reserved for it will no longer be needed. BPA does not have a provision in its transmission tariff for early termination of transmission service. However, the power purchase agreement with Patua requires Patua to cover unused transmission that SMUD has procured for the Patua purchases. On January 1, 2020, SMUD’s transmission rights with BPA were reduced to 19 MW. This now aligns with SMUD’s PacifiCorp transmission rights of 19 MW described in the immediately following paragraph.

**PacifiCorp.** In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with PacifiCorp for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service across PacifiCorp’s high voltage step-up transformer at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In early 2013, in accordance with PacifiCorp’s transmission tariff, the commencement of the 60 MW of transmission service was deferred to fit the timing of first deliveries expected from the 30 MW of Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In 2013, SMUD terminated the 60 MW of transmission service and requested two new transmission services of 30 MW each, with service start dates timed to better fit with the expected start dates of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the reduction in expected output of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the second 30 MW transmission agreement, and replaced it with a 10 MW transmission service agreement for Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 2 of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the 10 MW PacifiCorp transmission service agreement and as a result of the reduced obligation to take power from the Patua Project, SMUD has reduced its remaining PacifiCorp transmission service from 30 MW to 19 MW.

**Western Area Power Administration.** SMUD does not have a direct interconnection of its power system to the COTP. To receive power deliveries that use its COTP rights, SMUD has a long-term transmission service agreement with WAPA for transmission of 342 MW of power from the COTP line (received at WAPA’s Tracy or Olinda substations) to SMUD’s system. In May of 2011, WAPA completed the Sacramento Voltage Support Transmission Project. Completion of this project has given SMUD an additional 165 MW of transmission service rights on WAPA’s system from the COTP at the Olinda Substation to SMUD’s system at the Elverta Substation.

**Projected Resources**

The following tables titled “Projected Requirements and Resources to Meet Load Requirements Energy Requirements and Resources” (the “Energy Table”) and “Capacity Requirements and Resources Net Capacity – Megawatts” (the “Capacity Table”) describe SMUD’s contracted commitments and owned resources available to meet its forecasted load requirements through the year 2033. Resources are shown on an annualized basis with market purchases netted against surpluses to arrive at a single net position for each year. Because SMUD’s available resources do not exactly match its actual load requirements on an hourly basis, there are times during a year when resources available will either exceed or be insufficient to meet SMUD’s needs. Expected actual capacity values are included in the tables. These values may differ from measured net demonstrated capacity values of the Local Area Gas-Fired Plants. The table below also includes the impact energy efficiency has on resource requirements as discussed below under “Demand Side Management Programs.” See “BUSINESS STRATEGY” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.”

Resources listed in both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table are listed as either renewable or non-renewable. Generally, SMUD follows the CEC guidelines for eligibility requirements. Some of SMUD’s renewable resources listed include solar, wind, geothermal, small hydroelectric facilities with a capacity of 30 MW or less, and biomass (representing generation from a fuel comprised of agricultural wastes and residues, landscape and tree trimmings, wood and wood waste).

As in any forecast, assumptions are made. In both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table the WAPA and UARP forecasts assume average water conditions throughout the period. On the capacity table, WAPA and Cosumnes Power Plant renewable capacity is estimated based on the ratio of renewable energy to total WAPA or Cosumnes Power Plant energy. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric.”

A-40
<!-- Page 182 -->
The Uncommitted Purchases (Sales) on the tables represent either anticipated future needs or surpluses. Future needs are met well in advance of delivery. They also include both renewable and non-renewable resources.

The Transmission Losses represent reductions in the amount of energy or capacity from the location it was purchased to the point of entering SMUD’s electrical system. This amount reduces the Total Resources available to meet the Total Projected Energy Requirements of the electrical system.

## Demand Side Management Programs

SMUD’s demand-side management initiatives represent an integral element of its total resource portfolio, and are organized into two major components: energy efficiency and load management programs. Energy efficiency offerings include a wide variety of programs and services to customers to retrofit or upgrade existing equipment and fixtures and to install new energy efficiency measures in existing and new construction facilities. Load management allows SMUD to reduce the load on the electric system by cycling residential air conditioning, and calling upon commercial/industrial customers to curtail energy usage when energy is constrained during the summer or system emergencies. Load management programs are projected to allow SMUD to shed approximately 60 MW of peak load in an emergency on a hot day, representing about 2% of SMUD’s maximum system peak demand.

The customer “smart meter” system with 2-way communication capability provides information regarding customer usage patterns, which is expected to help SMUD tailor rate designs that provide customers with both the information and ability to manage their energy usage around high energy cost periods.

# Balancing Authority Area Agreements

## Background
SMUD began operating as an independent control area, later termed a Balancing Authority, on June 18, 2002 within the WECC reliability organization’s region. This reduced SMUD’s exposure to the costs and reliability risks of the CAISO’s markets. SMUD expanded its operational footprint beyond SMUD’s service territory to include WAPA’s electric system, including the MID, Roseville, and Redding service areas (on January 1, 2005) and the COTP (on December 1, 2005). As described further below, SMUD ceased to be the Balancing Authority on April 30, 2011, as BANC took SMUD’s place as the Balancing Authority. SMUD remains the operator of the Balancing Authority through a contract with BANC. SMUD administers the contracts with WAPA and TANC to provide specified Balancing Authority-related and other services, and is compensated by WAPA and TANC. TANC recovers such Balancing Authority services costs as a part of its annual operating budget from the COTP Participants and WAPA recovers its Balancing Authority services costs through its rates for power and transmission service. The agreement with WAPA, among other terms, establishes operating procedures and reserve obligations between the parties and terminates on December 31, 2024. BANC, SMUD and WAPA will develop successor agreements in 2024 to take effect upon expiration of the existing contract. WAPA in turn has agreements with electric systems connected to it to assure that such systems also operate reliably (i.e., MID, Roseville and Redding). As a result of the transition to BANC as the Balancing Authority, SMUD assigned or terminated its interconnection and operations agreements with other connecting Balancing Authority areas (i.e., CAISO, BPA and TID). BANC is now the party to these agreements as they primarily address only Balancing Authority matters required for compliance with the reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”), such as emergency assistance arrangements. See also “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY” – Western Energy Imbalance Market.”

## Reliability Standards
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC authority to enforce reliability standards for the bulk electric system. In June 2007, these standards became mandatory for SMUD and BANC.

In 2022, SMUD and BANC underwent a combined NERC/WECC audit to evaluate compliance with applicable reliability standards. These audits occur every three years. At the conclusion of the audit, regulators determined that neither entity had any compliance violations related to the Operations and Planning or Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards. SMUD and BANC will undergo another NERC/WECC audit sometime in 2025.

## Balancing Authority of Northern California
SMUD, MID, Redding and Roseville executed a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (the “BANC JPA Agreement”) creating BANC on May 8, 2009. BANC became operational on May 1, 2011 as a Balancing Authority and replaced SMUD as the entity responsible for Balancing Authority-related reliability standards. Since that time, the Trinity Public Utilities District and the City of Shasta Lake have also become members of BANC. As provided in the BANC member agreement, liability for penalties associated with such Balancing Authority-related reliability standards are shared on a pro rata basis among the members of BANC. SMUD is the Balancing Authority operator under contract and performs Balancing Authority operational functions on behalf of BANC, much as it did when it was the Balancing Authority. The BANC JPA Agreement assigns cost responsibility based on member load within the BANC Balancing Authority, with SMUD representing approximately 70% of the total load.

## Power Pool and Other Agreements

### Western Power Pool Agreement
The Western Power Pool (“WPP”) is an agreement among over 30 utilities and public agencies in the western United States to coordinate contingency reserve sharing.
<!-- Page 186 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Displayed)

referred to as the WPP Reserve Sharing Program (“RSP”). The RSP permits participants to rely on one another in the event that any participant experiences a generating resource outage. While SMUD became an RSP participant in 2009, participation is limited to Balancing Authorities, which SMUD relinquished to BANC in 2011. Under the RSP, BANC and TID (also a WPP member) share their reserve amounts and when necessary and when sufficient unused COTP rights and capacity are available, may call upon WPP reserves from the RSP member systems in the Pacific Northwest. The WPP RSP permits members to operate more efficiently by reducing the contingency reserves that they would otherwise need to have available if they could not rely on each other.

**TANC-SMUD OASIS Administration Agreement.** SMUD entered into an agreement with TANC to provide OASIS services (transmission sales and scheduling related services in the BANC BA of TANC members’ COTP rights) on September 29, 2005. SMUD is compensated for performing these services. TANC and SMUD entered into a letter agreement dated October 25, 2010 to clarify each party’s role for regulatory reliability standards compliance responsibilities and take into account SMUD’s increased efforts related to supporting TANC’s compliance requirements. SMUD and TANC entered into an agreement to transition this service to the Western Area Power Administration, effective on May 1, 2023. Going forward SMUD will only have a minor role in receiving payments and distributing revenues to the TANC members.

**Other Interconnection Agreements**

**Background.** SMUD’s electric system was originally purchased from PG&E in 1947. SMUD’s service area is mostly surrounded by PG&E’s and WAPA’s service areas. The SMUD and PG&E electric systems are interconnected at SMUD’s Rancho Seco and Lake 230-kV substations. SMUD and WAPA are interconnected at SMUD’s Hurley, Elverta, Natomas and Folsom 230-kV substations.

**PG&E Interconnection Agreement.** PG&E and SMUD executed a Replacement Interconnection Agreement (“RIA”) which became effective on January 1, 2010. The RIA provides that SMUD and PG&E operate their interconnections reliably, plan their electric systems to meet their load requirements, and avoid or mitigate impacts the cause by certain electric system modifications. The agreement has a termination date of December 31, 2024, subject to FERC approval. SMUD and other Northern California utilities have similar interconnection agreements with PG&E, albeit with different expiration dates. PG&E filed a successor interconnection agreement with one of these utilities, TID, on November 1, 2023, to become effective on January 1, 2024. Many interconnection customers, including SMUD, intervened and submitted comments or protests in the FERC docket. FERC accepted the filing and TID and PG&E are now in a settlement process, pending litigation of the parties action and resolve the disputed items. SMUD anticipates that PG&E will seek to negotiate a successor interconnection agreement with SMUD which will be informed by the TID settlement or litigation process. While some functional mechanisms in the interconnection agreement may change, SMUD expects that its successor interconnection agreement will substantially preserve the balance of burdens and benefits consistent with FERC’s standard of requiring rates and terms of service that are just and reasonable. SMUD expects this process to be completed by the current expiration date of the RIA.

**PG&E Generator Interconnection Agreements.** SMUD signed a LGIA with CAISO and PG&E for the Solano 3 Wind Project, effective December 16, 2008, with a 50-year term. The Solano 2 Wind Project has interconnection rights granted through a LGIA, also with the CAISO and PG&E. The agreement became effective in January 2010 and has a term of 20 years. On June 3, 2021, SMUD entered into a LGIA with the CAISO and PG&E, for the planned 90.8 MW Solano 4 Wind project with a 10-year term and automatic renewal for successive one-year terms thereafter. On February 27, 2023, SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process which combines the Solano 2, 3 & 4 projects into one Solano Wind Project. The original agreement conditions for the individual projects are carried forward with

A-45
<!-- Page 187 -->
a new combined project maximum production limit of 320.8 MW at the point of interconnection at the Russell Substation.

Other PG&E generator interconnection agreements include a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for Slab Creek with a 22-year term which became effective on January 14, 2010, and a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for the Chili Bar Project with a 10-year term which became effective on June 2, 2021.

WAPA Interconnection Agreement and other WAPA Agreements. SMUD and WAPA executed an interconnection agreement on May 8, 2008 for a term of 40 years which establishes the terms and conditions under which the SMUD and WAPA transmission systems are interconnected and memorializes related understandings. SMUD is working with WAPA on a reconfiguration at the shared Elverta interconnection to increase reliability and accommodate new generation interconnection in the area. SMUD has other agreements with WAPA including for operation of the Sutter Energy Center generating facility, communication systems terms and fiber optic access, training and for use of WAPA labor and heavy equipment to assist SMUD’s maintenance activities on an as-available basis.

![Management's Discussion of SMUD's Operating Results](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Management's+Discussion+of+SMUD's+Operating+Results)

**Management’s Discussion of SMUD’s Operating Results**

**Year Ended December 31, 2023.** For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $218.1 million as compared to an increase of $70.7 million for 2022.

Operating revenues were $228.5 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower sales of surplus gas ($118.3 million), transfers to the RSF ($67.2 million), sales to customers ($28.3 million), transfers from the RSF ($21.9 million), and LCFS revenue ($3.9 million), partially offset by higher sales of surplus power ($136.6 million), AB 32 revenue ($3.7 million), customer fees ($1.1 million), and lower transmission revenue ($2.3 million).

Operating expenses were $292.8 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower purchased power expenses ($175.5 million), production operating expenses ($146.4 million), depreciation expenses ($22.7 million), production maintenance expenses ($12.3 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($7.2 million), partially offset by higher administrative and general expenses ($33.4 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($15.8 million), public good expenses ($8.8 million), and customer service and information expenses ($6.6 million).

Non-Operating income increased by $55.2 million primarily due to fair market value assessment and gain on sale of land ($33.3 million), higher interest income ($21.7 million), higher unrealized holding gains ($11.4 million), higher CCA revenue ($5.7 million), partially offset by lower investment income ($39.1 million).

Interest expense decreased $27.9 million from 2022.

**Year Ended December 31, 2022.** For the year ended December 31, 2022, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $70.7 million as compared to an increase of $347.3 million for 2021.

Operating revenues were $363.0 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher sales to customers ($130.7 million), sales of surplus gas ($96.0 million), sales of surplus power ($62.2 million), transfers to the RSF ($28.9 million), transfers from the RSF ($24.3 million), customer fees ($9.5 million), AB 32 revenue ($4.9 million) and LCFS revenue ($2.2 million), partially offset by lower gain on sale of carbon allowance futures ($3.7 million).

Operating expenses were $601.2 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher purchased power expenses ($263.6 million), amortization of pension and OPEB ($126.9 million), production operating expenses ($125.1 million), depreciation expenses ($49.5 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($22.1 million), production maintenance expenses ($18.4 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($8.1 million), public good expenses ($7.4 million), and customer service and information expenses ($4.5 million), partially offset by lower administrative and general expenses ($27.4 million).

Non-Operating income decreased by $19.0 million primarily due to lower grant revenue ($39.6 million), unrealized holding losses ($3.7 million), partially offset by higher investment income ($19.7 million), closeout of escrow account ($2.8 million), and loss on asset retirements ($1.9 million).

Interest expense increased $19.5 million from 2021.

**Regulatory Assets.** In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” SMUD defers, as regulatory assets, certain types of expenditures. These assets are amortized and collected through future rates.

As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had a total of $916.1 million recorded for regulatory assets. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 68 which requires SMUD to record a net pension liability was $323.5 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 68 was $174.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 75 which requires SMUD to record a net Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) liability was $268.2 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 75 was $39.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with Rancho Seco decommissioning costs totaled $108.0 million at December 31, 2023. Nuclear fuel storage costs and non-radiological decommissioning costs have been collected in rates since 2009. For a complete description of these regulatory assets, see Note 8 (Regulatory Deferrals) to SMUD’s financial statements.

The Board has authorized the deferral of any charges or credits that result from the change in valuation of ineffective hedges that should be reported as Investment Revenue/Expense on the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and changes in net position. The Board’s resolution establishes that such charges or credits are not included in rates based on market value changes but are included in rates when the underlying transactions occur. Therefore, under GASB No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” any such changes are included in the Statement of Net Position as regulatory assets or liabilities. For a complete description of these derivative financial instruments, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s financial statements.

RANCHO SECO DECOMMISSIONING

Overview. The 913 MW Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant (“Rancho Seco”) began operation in 1970 and was licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”). In June 1989, the NRC issued a notice of violation against allowing SMUD to continue to operate Rancho Seco as a nuclear generating facility, and the plant was shut down. In 1991, SMUD submitted a report (the “Financial Assurance Plan”) providing financial assurance to the NRC that SMUD will have sufficient funds available to pay for the cost of decommissioning. On March 17, 1992, the NRC granted SMUD a change from operating to a possession-only license for Rancho Seco that relieved SMUD from compliance with a number of NRC regulations applicable to operating nuclear power plants. SMUD also filed a proposed decommissioning plan with the NRC (the “Decommissioning Plan”), which was approved in March 1995.

After the decommissioning efforts began, no suitable disposal option was available to SMUD for the Class B and Class C low level radioactive waste generated during the plant decommissioning. With the used nuclear fuel stored onsite requiring oversight staff, SMUD opted to store the Class B and Class C radioactive waste in an existing interim onsite storage building until a suitable disposal option was available. In November 2007, the possession-only license for Rancho Seco was amended to update the Decommissioning Plan to terminate the possession-only license for the Class B and Class C waste in two phases. Phase I of the decommissioning was completed at the end of 2008. Following verification of the site conditions, SMUD submitted a request to the NRC to reduce the licensed facility from 2,480 acres to the interim onsite storage building and about one acre surrounding it. The request was approved by the NRC in September 2009. Phase II of decommissioning included the approximately two-acre interim storage building containing the Class B and Class C radioactive waste and surrounding area. In September 2013, SMUD entered into a contract with the operator of the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility located in Andrews, Texas. Shipment of the Class B and Class C radioactive waste for disposal was completed in November 2014. SMUD conducted additional clean-up activities and radiological surveys, which were followed by NRC confirmatory surveys. The results of these surveys demonstrated unit dose criteria well below NRC release criteria, and the NRC approved the Phase II area for unrestricted use. On September 21, 2017, SMUD formally requested the termination of the possession-only license. On August A-51

31, 2018, the NRC officially terminated SMUD’s possession-only license for the remaining Class B and Class C waste at Rancho Seco.

As part of the Decommissioning Plan, the nuclear fuel and Greater Than Class C (“GTCC”) radioactive waste is being stored in a dry storage facility (the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation or “ISFSI”) constructed by SMUD, adjacent to the former reactor facility. The NRC has separately licensed this facility. The DOE, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, is responsible for permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel and GTCC radioactive waste. SMUD has a contract with the DOE for the removal and disposal of this waste. The DOE was to have a waste repository operating by 1998, but has experienced significant and ongoing delays. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act designates Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the final and exclusive repository for the nation’s used nuclear fuel. The DOE discontinued the Yucca Mountain license review activities in 2010, but after a court ordered the NRC to resume its review in 2013, the NRC published its final safety evaluation report in 2015. The final safety report, and the final environmental impact statement, concluded that the proposed repository would be safe and environmentally sound for one million years.

Nevertheless, seeking alternatives to Yucca Mountain, the Blue-Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future delivered its final report in January 2012 with several recommendations. The DOE responded to the recommendations by issuing a report in January 2013 (Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste). Key to both documents is a focus on used fuel from decommissioned sites including Rancho Seco. The DOE report accepts most of the Blue-Ribbon Commission recommendations, and contains timelines for fuel management options which proposed removing the fuel from Rancho Seco as early as 2021. However, any progress on the strategies proposed by the DOE is dependent on legislative action by Congress. With no legislative action taken to date, the 2021 projected date for removal slips year-for-year. Therefore, SMUD continues to incur costs at this time when the DOE will fulfill its contractual obligations to remove the nuclear fuel and GTCC waste from the Rancho Seco facility. In the meantime, SMUD continues to incur costs of approximately $5 to $7 million per year for storage of used nuclear fuel at the ISFSI. SMUD has filed a series of successful lawsuits against the federal government for recovery of past spent fuel costs. SMUD has recovered over $14 million in 2023. SMUD plans to continue pursuing cost recovery claims to ensure it is reimbursed for all such costs in the future. The ISFSI will be decommissioned, and its license terminated after the fuel and GTCC is removed.

Financial Assurance Plan. In accordance with the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD established and funded an external decommissioning trust fund currently held by Computershare Corporate Trust (the “Decommissioning Trust Fund”). Pursuant to the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD made the final deposit into the Decommissioning Trust Fund in 2008. Additional deposits are not expected but will be made if increased cost estimates or reduced fund interest earnings require it. In 2011, the NRC began requiring that SMUD demonstrate financial assurance for decommissioning the ISFSI as well as the former power facility, increasing the overall cost for decommissioning Rancho Seco. The estimated total cost for decommissioning the ISFSI was approximately $7.1 million on December 31, 2023. The decommissioning cost estimate is required to be updated every three years. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the Decommissioning Trust Fund was $9.4 million, excluding unrealized gains and losses. Based on the current decommissioning cost estimate and the value of the fund, SMUD’s existing Decommissioning Trust Fund provides sufficient funds to complete decommissioning and terminate the ISFSI license.

In addition to these costs, SMUD also estimates that it would cost approximately $13.1 million to restore the site to make it available for other SMUD uses with some major structures remaining intact. Site restoration is not a legal requirement. No site restoration is currently underway.

# EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

SMUD has approximately 2,334 employees, most of whom are covered by a civil service system. SMUD is a contracting member of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“PERS”). Approximately 50% of SMUD’s work-force is represented as to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment, by one of three recognized employee organizations, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) Local 1245, the Organization of SMUD Employees (“OSE”), and the SMUD Public Safety Officers’ Association (“PSOA”). The remaining 50% of SMUD’s workforce, which includes managers, professional, administrative, supervisory, confidential and security staff, is unrepresented.

SMUD negotiated a four-year Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with IBEW and the OSE, effective January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2025. Both contracts contain a no-strike/no-lockout clause effective during the life of the agreements. SMUD has an MOU with PSOA effective through December 31, 2026. SMUD has experienced only one labor interruption, which occurred in January 1980 that lasted four days.

# RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POST-EMPLOYMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

## Pension Plans

SMUD participates in PERS, an agent multiple-employer public employee defined benefit pension plan. PERS provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. PERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State. Benefit provisions are established by State statute and SMUD policies. The pension plan provides retirement benefits, survivor benefits, and death and disability benefits based upon employees’ years of credited service, age, and final compensation.

As of June 30, 2022, the last actuarial valuation date for SMUD’s plan within PERS, the market value of the SMUD plan assets was $2.32 billion. The plan is 87.8% funded on a market value of assets basis, a decrease of 12.3% compared to the June 30, 2021 funded status based on the market value of assets.

As an employer, SMUD is required to contribute a percentage of payroll each year to PERS to fund SMUD’s plan based on actuarial valuations performed by PERS. PERS collects the normal cost based on a percentage of payroll and the unfunded liability portion is based on a dollar amount. SMUD also makes partial contributions required of SMUD employees on their behalf and for their account. At the PERS fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, SMUD’s required employer contribution rate for normal cost was 9.8% of payroll and the unfunded liability contribution was $22.4 million. During 2023, SMUD contributed $37.4 million to PERS (including SMUD’s contributions to cover required employee contributions), and SMUD employees paid $18.3 million for their share of the PERS contribution.

For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025, SMUD is required to contribute 9.6% and 9.5% of payroll for normal costs and $10.7 million for fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 for the unfunded liability contribution. There is no estimated employer contribution to the unfunded liability for fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Assuming no amendments to the plan and no liability gains or losses (which can have a significant impact), PERS has projected that SMUD will be required to contribute 9.4% of payroll to the plan for normal costs and $15.7 million for the unfunded liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions. The amount SMUD is required to contribute to PERS is expected to increase in the future. The actual amount of such increases

SMUD has the option to prepay an annual lump sum payment to PERS for the unfunded accrued liability portion only (not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions). SMUD made an annual lump sum prepayment of $19.5 million, and also voluntarily made an additional payment of $47.3 million, for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. SMUD was not required to make an annual lump sum prepayment and, to date, has not voluntarily made additional payments for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

While SMUD has some ability to adjust the retirement benefits provided to its employees, PERS determines the actuarial methods and assumptions used with respect to assets administered by PERS (including the SMUD plan assets) and makes the investment decisions with respect to such assets. For a description of such actuarial methods and assumptions (including the smoothing conventions used by PERS when setting employer contribution rates) and investments, see the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS (SMUD’s plan is part of the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund of PERS) available on its website at www.calpers.ca.gov. SMUD cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information and neither the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS nor any other information contained on the PERS website is incorporated by reference in or part of this Official Statement. Actuarial assessments are “forward-looking” information that reflect the judgment of the fiduciaries of the pension plans, and are based upon a variety of assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be inaccurate or be changed in the future. Actuarial assessments will change with the future experience of the pension plans.

GASB issued Statement No. 68 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – An Amendment of GASB Statement No. 27” (“GASB No. 68”). The primary objective of GASB No. 68 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for pensions. Under GASB No. 68, SMUD is required to report the net pension asset or net pension liability (i.e., the difference between the total pension liability and the pension plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of investment gains and losses. GASB No. 68 separates financial reporting from funding requirements for pension plans. The pension liability as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is $259.0 million and $235.5 million, respectively.

SMUD provides its employees with two cash deferred compensation plans: one pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 401(k) (the “401(k) Plan”) and one pursuant to IRC Section 457 (the “457 Plan” and collectively, the “Plans”). The Plans are contributory plans in which SMUD’s employees contribute the funds. Each of SMUD’s eligible full-time or permanent part-time employees may participate in either or both Plans, and amounts contributed by employees are vested immediately. Such funds are held by a trustee in trust for the employees upon retirement from SMUD service and, accordingly, are not subject to the general claims of SMUD’s creditors. SMUD makes annual contributions to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of certain employees pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with both of its collective bargaining units. SMUD matches the non-represented employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to a set amount. SMUD also makes limited discretionary contributions to non-represented employees hired after January 1, 2013, which contributions fully vest after five years. Prior to 2022, SMUD did not match employee contributions, nor make contributions on behalf of its employees to the 457 Plan. Beginning in 2022, SMUD makes annual contributions to the 457 Plan on behalf of certain employees and matches employee contributions up to a set amount pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with one of its collective bargaining units. SMUD made contributions to both Plans of $6.9 million in 2023 and to the 401(k) Plan of $7.0 million in 2022. Participating employees made contributions into both Plans totaling $34.3 million in 2023 and $32.4 million in 2022.

![Other Post-Employment Benefits](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Other+Post-Employment+Benefits)

**Other Post-Employment Benefits**

SMUD provides post-employment healthcare benefits, in accordance with SMUD policy and negotiated agreements with employee representation groups in a single employer defined benefit plan, to all employees who retire from SMUD, and their dependents. SMUD also provides post-employment healthcare benefits to covered employees who are eligible for disability retirement. SMUD contributes the full cost of coverage for retirees hired before January 1, 1991, and a portion of the cost based on credited years of service for retirees hired after January 1, 1991. SMUD also contributes a portion of the costs of coverage for these retirees’ dependents. Retirees are required to contribute the portion that is not paid by SMUD. The benefits, benefit levels, retiree contributions and employer contributions are governed by SMUD and can be amended by SMUD through its personnel manual and union contracts.

SMUD’s post-employment health care benefits are funded through the PERS California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (“CERBT”), an agent multiple-employer plan. The funding of a plan occurs when the following events take place: the employer makes payments of benefits directly to or on behalf of a retiree or beneficiary; the employer makes premium payments to an insurer; or the employer irrevocably transfers assets to a trust or other third party acting in the role of trustee, where the plan assets are dedicated to the sole purpose of the payments of the plan benefits, and creditors of the government do not have access to those assets.

SMUD has elected to contribute the normal costs to the CERBT but annually receive reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT. In 2024, SMUD’s contribution for the normal costs to CERBT is $10.6 million. In 2023, SMUD made a contribution to the CERBT for normal costs in the amount of $8.6 million. In 2022, SMUD decided to forgo making a contribution for the normal costs to the CERBT because there was a net OPEB asset as of December 31, 2021. SMUD made additional contributions to the trust. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD made healthcare benefit contributions by paying actual medical costs of $24.7 million and $24.5 million, respectively. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD received $24.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively, reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT.

At June 30, 2023 and 2022, SMUD estimated that the actuarially determined accumulated post-employment benefit obligation was approximately $403.6 and $381.7 million, respectively. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the plan was 92.3% and 97.9% funded, respectively.

SMUD’s actuary uses PERS economic and other assumptions as the basis for the calculation of the post-employment benefit obligation. The actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will vary substantially if such PERS assumptions, such as interest rate and life expectancy, among others, prove to be inaccurate or different than SMUD’s actual experience. Although SMUD believes that such assumptions and estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that any such assumptions will prove to be accurate, or that SMUD’s actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will not materially exceed its estimates. Additional information is available in Note 15 (Other Postemployment Benefits) and “Required Supplementary Information” to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

GASB previously issued SGAS No. 75 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions”. The primary objective of GASB No. 75 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for post-employment benefits other than pensions (“OPEB”). Under GASB No. 75, SMUD is required to report the net OPEB asset or net OPEB liability (i.e., the difference between the total OPEB liability and the OPEB plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of

**CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS**

**Estimated Capital Requirements**

SMUD has a projected capital requirement of approximately $2.8 billion for the period 2024 through 2028 as shown in the table below. Approximately 60% of this requirement is anticipated to be funded with internally generated funds and cash on hand.

Special projects include costs relating to construction of large substations and the construction of Solano Phase 4. The Estimated Capital Requirements table below includes $51 million for Solano Phase 4. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Solano 4 Project.”

**Outstanding Indebtedness**

**General.** SMUD typically finances its capital requirements through the sale of revenue bonds, the sale of commercial paper, from draws on its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and from internally generated funds. With the enactment of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2024 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, SMUD is monitoring and exploring new methods of financing, including those afforded under these two federal laws, that provide not-for-profit public power utilities with direct federal incentive payments.

SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Senior Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 (the “Senior Resolution”) adopted in 1971, as amended and supplemented (the “Senior Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Senior Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $1,783,965,000 outstanding. The Senior Bonds are payable solely from the Net Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Senior Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of “Maintenance and Operation Costs” and “Energy Payments” as defined in the Senior Resolution, including payments by SMUD to TANC under PA3, payments by SMUD under power purchase agreements related to the Authorities and payments by SMUD to NCGA and NCEA under their respective gas supply contracts. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD’s Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the “Subordinated Resolution”).
<!-- Page 198 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

“Subordinate Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Subordinated Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds.

SMUD issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of March 21, 2024, SMUD’s Notes were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes (and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit) are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD also entered into a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank and issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes thereunder (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in February 2022. As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

Joint Powers Authorities. SMUD has entered into long-term take-or-pay purchase agreements with SFA relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Under such agreements, SMUD has exclusive control of the dispatch of all five of the Local Gas-Fired Plants and takes all of the power produced by the Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” The Authorities are each treated as component units of SMUD for accounting purposes. Only SFA has outstanding debt, which relates solely to the Cosumnes Power Plant and is payable solely from capacity payments made by SMUD under the related power purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2023, bonds issued by SFA to finance the Cosumnes Power Plant were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $87,890,000. SMUD’s payments under the power purchase agreements relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal of and interest on the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and Subordinate Resolution.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCGA as a joint powers authority. NCGA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCGA issued $757,055,000 in bonds in May 2007 for the purpose of paying Morgan Stanley Capital Group in advance for natural gas to be delivered to NCGA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas supplies delivered by NCGA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the 

A-57

![NCGA bonds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=NCGA+bonds)

NCGA bonds. As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $120,070,000 remain outstanding.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCEA as a joint powers authority. NCEA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCEA issued $539,615,000 in bonds in December 2018 for the purpose of paying J. Aron & Company LLC in advance for natural gas or electricity to be delivered to NCEA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas or electricity supplies delivered by NCEA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the NCEA bonds. [As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $537,295,000 remain outstanding. As described in the forepart of this Official Statement, the bonds issued by NCEA in 2018 are expected to be refunded with proceeds of the Bonds (as defined in the forepart of this Official Statement.)] [to be revised for 2024 Senior Bond offering documents]

**Interest Rate Swap Agreements.** SMUD has two interest rate swap agreements relating to previously or currently outstanding Subordinated Bonds, as shown in the following table. For more information, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

| Effective Date | Termination Date | SMUD Pays | SMUD Receives | Notional Amount (000's) | Counterparty |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 7/2/1997       | 7/1/2024         | Floating SIFMA | 5.154% | $19,570 | J Aron & Company LLC |
| 07/12/2023     | 08/15/2041       | Fixed 0.718% SOFR | [70% of 1M] | 132,020 | Barclays Bank |

The obligations of SMUD under the swap agreements are not secured by a pledge of revenues of SMUD’s electric system or any other property of SMUD. SMUD does not currently have any collateral posting requirements with respect to the interest rate swap agreements, but SMUD may be required to post collateral under certain circumstances.

**Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments.** SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”) and Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series W (the “2010 Series W Bonds”) were issued as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. At the time the 2009 Series V Bonds and 2010 Series W Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive an annual cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. However, as a result of the federal budget process, many payments from the federal government, including Build America Bonds subsidy payments, have been reduced. Absent the federal budget reductions, the aggregate annual cash subsidy payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds would be approximately $9.8 million. With the current federal budget reductions, SMUD has typically been receiving aggregate annual cash subsidy payments with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds of approximately $9.2 million. It is possible that future federal budget actions could further reduce, or eliminate entirely, the annual cash subsidy payments with respect to Build America Bonds, including the annual cash subsidy payments payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. SMUD cannot predict the likelihood of the further reduction or elimination of the Build America Bonds subsidy payments. A significant reduction or elimination of the cash subsidy

# INSURANCE

SMUD maintains a comprehensive property/casualty insurance program designed to protect against catastrophic losses that would have an adverse effect on its financial position or operational capabilities. Insurance programs are continuously reviewed and modified when construction, operational exposures, or developments in the insurance industry so warrant. Long-term relationships with a variety of insurers minimize SMUD’s susceptibility to the effects of market cycles. SMUD budgets reserves to meet potential insurance deductibles and self-insured liability claims.

SMUD safeguards assets with all-risk property and boiler/machinery insurance with limits of $800 million per occurrence for physical damage and business interruption combined. Various coverage sublimits and deductibles apply to losses arising from certain perils, such as business interruption, earthquake, or flood, respectively. Liability insurance is in effect to defend and indemnify SMUD against third party claims, including general, automobile and sudden and accidental pollution claims with policy limits of $140 million, and wildfire coverage with policy limits of $275 million, all of which include a variety of self-insured retentions.

Nuclear property and liability insurance policies are maintained in accordance with the NRC’s requirements for decommissioned nuclear plants that maintain dry storage of spent fuel on-site. This includes $100 million in first party property damage and decontamination, $100 million for nuclear liability arising from accidents on-site, $200 million for supplier’s and transporter’s nuclear liability, and $300 million for nuclear worker liability. SMUD is exposed to possible retrospective assessments for nuclear property events occurring at other nuclear facilities in the United States capped at ten times SMUD’s annual nuclear property premium (currently the maximum retrospective assessment is approximately $1,000,000).

Other types of insurance include non-owned aircraft liability, workers’ compensation, crime, cyber security, fidelity, fiduciary liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, professional errors and omissions, transportation, and builder’s risk for major facilities under construction.

# LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

SMUD is a party to numerous actions arising out of the conduct of its business and affairs, some of which are discussed below. SMUD believes that any losses or adverse financial results it may suffer in these current actions, to the extent not covered by insurance, would not, in the aggregate, have an adverse material impact on SMUD, its business and affairs, or results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

## Environmental Litigation

SMUD was one of many potentially responsible parties that had been named in a number of actions relating to environmental claims and/or complaints. SMUD has resolved these environmental claims and/or complaints and entered into settlement agreements and/or consent orders. These settlement agreements and consent orders have statutory reopener provisions which allow regulatory agencies to seek additional funds for environmental remediation under certain limited circumstances. While SMUD believes it is unlikely that any of the prior settlements or consent orders will be reopened, the possibility exists. If any of the settlements or consent orders were to be reopened, SMUD believes that the outcome will not have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

## Proposition 26 Lawsuit

In October 2019, two SMUD customers jointly filed a complaint against SMUD (subsequently one of the customers removed themselves from the complaint), which stated that SMUD’s Board violated

A-60
<!-- Page 202 -->
![Proposition 26](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Proposition+26)

**Proposition 26** (see “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Proposition 26” for a description of Proposition 26) when on June 24, 2019, it adopted rate increases for 2020 and 2021. The plaintiff contended the rates did not reflect SMUD’s reasonable cost of service because they included a 9.2% scalar that SMUD applies to its TOD residential rate restructure adopted by SMUD’s Board in the 2017 rate process. SMUD viewed the lawsuit as having little merit and while SMUD anticipated the court would rule in SMUD’s favor on substantive grounds, the plaintiff in early 2024 agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice due to their failure to diligently prosecute the case. On January 16, 2024, the court approved the dismissal.

On January 19, 2024, the same plaintiff, along with a second SMUD residential customer, jointly filed a new complaint challenging the September 21, 2023, SMUD Board adoption of 2024 and 2025 rate increases. The plaintiffs make a similar claim regarding the TOD scalar as the prior lawsuit. Given the little merit behind the lawsuit, SMUD believes the court will rule in its favor. However, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the case or, if to the extent SMUD ultimately is not successful in the litigation, what remedies against SMUD may be available. SMUD believes that if it is not successful in the litigation and to the extent the outcome would have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, the Board would make appropriate rate modifications based on an evidentiary record consistent with guidance from a judicial decision in the case.

**Other Litigation Matters**

Currently, SMUD is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints relating to its operations, including, but not limited to, property damage, personal injury, contract disputes, and employment matters. SMUD believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

**FERC Administrative Proceedings**

SMUD is involved in a number of FERC administrative proceedings related to the operation of wholesale energy markets, regional transmission planning, gas transportation and NERC reliability standards. These proceedings generally fall into the following categories: (i) filings initiated by the CAISO (or other market participants) to adopt/modify the CAISO Tariff and/or establish market design and behavior rules; (ii) filings initiated by existing transmission owners (i.e., PG&E and the other IOUs) to pass-through costs to their existing wholesale transmission customers; (iii) filings initiated by FERC to market participants to establish market design and behavior rules or investigate market behavior by certain market participants; (iv) filings initiated by transmission owners under their transmission owner tariffs to establish a regional transmission planning process; (v) filings initiated by providers of firm gas transportation services under the Natural Gas Act; and (vi) filings initiated by NERC to develop reliability standards applicable to owners, users, and operators of the bulk electric system. In addition, SMUD is an active participant in other FERC administrative proceedings, including those related to reliability, variable resource integration and the changing resource mix, and transmission planning and cost allocation. SMUD believes that determinations of these FERC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

**CPUC Administrative Proceedings**

Periodically, PG&E seeks to update its gas transmission and storage (“GT&S”) revenue requirements and rate designs. These applications are litigated at the CPUC and affect SMUD through several tariff rates SMUD pays to move natural gas along PG&E’s backbone transmission lines. In the 2019 GT&S rate case (the “2019 GT&S Case”), the CPUC affirmed the application in GT&S rates of cost causation principles to prevent excessive and unreasonable costs being shifted to electric generator.

A-61

backbone customers like SMUD, either through proposed changes in PG&E’s natural gas storage strategy or through cost shifts within the electric generator customer class.

PG&E filed its 2023 General Rate Case (the “GRC”) in June 2021 which includes its gas transmission and storage revenue requirements. In September 2021, PG&E filed an application for approval of its Gas Cost Allocation and Rate Design Proposals (“CARD”). The CPUC issued a decision in the GRC in November 2023 authorizing PG&E’s revenue requirements for the four-year rate period of 2023-2026. SMUD is a party to the comprehensive all-party settlement agreement submitted to the CPUC for approval in June 2023 which, if approved, would resolve all open issues in the CARD proceeding. SMUD does not believe that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. SMUD will continue to actively participate in PG&E’s GRC and CARD proceedings to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to non-core customers, including electric generator backbone customers.

In the GRC, the CPUC directed PG&E to submit an application to revise its natural gas curtailment procedures “similar to the curtailment procedures of other large energy utilities”. SMUD will actively participate in this future proceeding.

Separately, SMUD continues to participate and monitor a proceeding at the CPUC concerning long-term gas system planning. At this point in these proceedings, SMUD does not anticipate that the resolution of such cases will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

SMUD monitors a number of other CPUC proceedings. These proceedings generally fall into three categories: (i) filings initiated by PG&E to adopt/modify its tariffs and/or rules; (ii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish market design and behavior rules or program rules affecting SMUD customers; and (iii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish electric and/or gas system safety design and maintenance rules. SMUD believes that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR

California Electric Market

In 1996, the State partially deregulated its electric energy market and the CAISO was established in 1998. Since the CAISO’s formation, the State has experienced episodes of higher and more volatile prices for natural gas and wholesale electricity. In reaction to such conditions, SMUD made significant changes to its business strategy to mitigate the impacts of the more volatile and unpredictable energy markets. Volatility in energy prices in the State are always a potential risk due to a variety of factors which affect both the supply and demand for electricity in the western United States. These factors include, but are not limited to, the implementation of the CAISO market design changes, insufficient generation resources, the increase in intermittent renewable energy resources, natural gas price volatility, fuel costs and availability, weather and natural disasters, transmission constraints and levels of hydroelectric generation within the region. While SMUD has taken a number of steps to mitigate its exposure to price volatility associated with these factors, this price volatility under extreme conditions may contribute to greater volatility in SMUD’s net revenues from the purchase and sale of electric energy and, therefore, could materially adversely affect the financial condition and liquidity of SMUD. For a discussion of SMUD’s current resource planning activities and risk management strategies, see “BUSINESS STRATEGY” above.

# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity continues to be a top priority for SMUD. Attacks or threats directed at critical electric or energy sector operations could damage or cause the shut-down of generation, transmission or distribution assets that are essential to SMUD’s ability to serve its customers, cause operational malfunctions and outages affecting SMUD’s electric system, and result in costly recovery and remediation efforts. The costs of security measures or of remedying breaches could be material.

SMUD participates in sharing and receiving information about cyber security threats in real-time through the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (“E-ISAC”), the central hub for such data to actively manage risk related to potential cyber intrusion. SMUD also participates in NERC’s development of mandatory, enforceable cyber security standards to address vulnerabilities in electric utility systems. SMUD also adopts voluntary measures suggested as best practices by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) in its national framework.

SMUD’s prudent response to this ever-changing threat requires constant monitoring and frequent updates to implement new regulatory requirements as they are developed. SMUD manages risk related to frequently changing regulatory requirements by participating in the development of standards at NERC and NIST and through active engagement in the cyber security policy dialogue in Congress.

# Physical Security

Physical security is a critical concern for electric utilities as they seek to protect their infrastructure from a range of threats. The electric utility infrastructure is complex and consists of multiple components, such as power plants, substations, transmission and distribution lines, and other facilities. SMUD employs a dedicated physical security team that is deployed 24/7 and allows SMUD to respond to emergent events in a safe, coordinated, efficient, and cohesive manner, protecting the lives of its employees, customers, community, properties and assets. SMUD has policies, processes and procedures in place that outline the access controls and restrictions for its properties. SMUD restricts access based on need as it determines, while adhering to applicable laws, regulations and standards such as NERC Reliability Standards and NRC regulations. SMUD also maintains a Utility Security Plan adopted by the Board representing SMUD’s compliance with the CPUC’s Safety and Enforcement Division six-step security plan process described in CPUC Decision 19-01-018.

During times of elevated, imminent threats, safety and/or security concerns, SMUD’s Security Operations team, under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer or delegate, reserves the right to deploy additional security measures, controls, and further restrict or limit access to its properties to increase its security posture.

SMUD operates a 24/7 security operations center which monitors and coordinates responses to situations reported by internal and external stakeholders, or which are detected by SMUD’s security technology. The technology includes access control, video surveillance, and various types of intrusion detection solutions. The security operations center is a central hub for initial contact for physical security calls from employees of suspicious events and initiates incident responses as needed.

# Federal Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings

## Energy Policy Act of 2005

On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct of 2005”) was signed into law. The law includes a number of energy-related provisions, including among other things limited FERC jurisdiction over interstate transmission assets of municipal utilities, cooperatives and federal utilities to order these entities to provide transmission services on rates and terms. 

A-63
<!-- Page 205 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Federal Regulation of Transmission Access.** The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the “Energy Policy Act”) made fundamental changes in the federal regulation of the electric utility industry, particularly in the area of transmission access. The Energy Policy Act provided FERC with the authority to require a transmitting utility to provide transmission services at rates, charges, terms and conditions set by FERC. The purpose of these changes, in part, was to bring about increased competition in the electric utility industry. Under the Energy Policy Act, electric utilities owned by municipalities and other public agencies which own or operate electric power transmission facilities which are used for the sale of electric energy at wholesale are “transmitting utilities” subject to the requirements of the Energy Policy Act.

Since the Energy Policy Act, FERC has adopted a series of rules to implement competitive open access to transmission facilities and regional transmission planning. Order No. 888, issued in 1996, requires the provision of open access transmission services on a nondiscriminatory basis by all “jurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does not include municipal entities like SMUD) by requiring all such utilities to file OATTs. Order No. 888 also requires “nonjurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does include SMUD) that purchase transmission services from a jurisdictional utility under an open access tariff and that owns or controls transmission facilities to provide open access service to the jurisdictional utility under terms that are comparable to the service that the nonjurisdictional utility provides itself. Section 211A of the EPAct of 2005 authorizes, but does not require, FERC to direct transmission utilities to provide transmission services, including rates and terms and conditions, that are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting utility provides transmission services to itself that are not unduly discriminatory or preferential – often referred to as the reciprocity rule.

In Order 890, issued in 2007, FERC stated that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis and retain the current reciprocity provisions.

In 2011, FERC issued Order 1000, which among other things requires public utility (jurisdictional) transmission providers to participate in a regional transmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan and that incorporates a regional and inter-regional cost allocation methodology. Similar to Order 890, FERC states that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis. However, in Order 1000, FERC appears to expand upon the current reciprocity provisions and states that it has the authority to allocate costs to beneficiaries of services provided by specific transmission facilities even in the absence of a contractual relationship between the owner of the transmission facilities and the identified beneficiary.

SMUD, individually, and through the Large Public Power Council (“LPPC”), appealed Order 1000, but in 2014 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the arguments raised on appeal, upholding the entirety of Order 1000.

The jurisdictional members of WestConnect filed their proposed regional planning process and cost allocation methodology through a series of compliance filings at FERC. FERC accepted binding cost allocation for jurisdictional transmission providers of WestConnect and mandated that non-jurisdictional transmission providers (such as SMUD) identified as beneficiaries of a project have the ability to not accept the cost allocation. WestConnect’s Order 1000 planning process began with the 2016-2017 planning cycle. 

A-64
<!-- Page 206 -->
However, in response to FERC’s WestConnect orders on compliance, El Paso Electric Company (“El Paso”), a jurisdictional transmission provider, petitioned to the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. El Paso contends that FERC’s WestConnect orders violate Order 1000’s cost causation principle because WestConnect’s binding cost allocation applies only to the jurisdictional transmission providers and thus forces jurisdictional transmission providers to subsidize projects benefiting non-jurisdictional transmission providers that opt-out of projects. The non-jurisdictional transmission providers agreed on a settlement with the jurisdictional transmission providers to resolve the matters on appeal in the 5th Circuit, but FERC ultimately did not accept the settlement. On August 2, 2023, the court reversed FERC’s orders implementing Order No. 1000 for WestConnect concerning cost allocation of regional transmission projects to non-jurisdictional transmission providers. The court found that the WestConnect orders are incompatible with Order No. 1000’s application of the cost causation principle to address free ridership. There is uncertainty at this time on the future of WestConnect’s regional planning process. FERC has not yet acted on its own in light of the Fifth Circuit’s decision, and it is uncertain whether it will act while it is working on an updated transmission planning and cost allocation proposal that could change the Order 1000 process (as further discussed below regarding the April 21, 2022 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking). It is also uncertain if and/or the extent to which the jurisdictional transmission providers in WestConnect will file revisions to the regional transmission planning provisions in their OATTs. In the meantime, the WestConnect planning has continued under the existing framework and SMUD, along with the other non-jurisdictional transmission providers, continue to participate in the WestConnect process. SMUD’s longstanding objective is to comply with open access requirements necessary to achieve reciprocity, including through participation in a regional planning process while binding itself to mandatory cost allocation. Thus, SMUD has an interest in continuing to explore options for participation in a regional transmission planning process if the WestConnect rules are modified to permit SMUD to reasonably participate consistent with its business and jurisdictional interests.

SMUD is unable to predict at this time the full impact that Order 1000, or the 5th Circuit’s August decision, will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the WestConnect process generally. However, WestConnect has conducted multiple planning cycles under its Order 1000 planning process and has not identified any project eligible for cost allocation. SMUD will continue to take any action necessary, including withdrawing from a cost allocation determination or planning region, and engaging in FERC proceedings, to ensure that it is not required to pay for transmission costs in the absence of an agreement or service relationship.

On April 21, 2022, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation and Generator Interconnection (the “NOPR”). The NOPR seeks input on proposals that would impact the Order 1000 planning and cost allocation process. SMUD has been engaged in the proceeding, providing input and helping draft comments with trade organizations, including LPPC. FERC has not issued any subsequent order. SMUD will continue to monitor and be engaged in any developments at FERC that impact the Order 1000 process and its regional transmission planning participation.

NERC Reliability Standards. The EPAct of 2005 required FERC to certify an electric reliability organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable reliability standards, subject to FERC review and approval. On February 3, 2006, FERC issued Order 672, which certified NERC as the ERO. Many reliability standards have since been approved by FERC, including those aimed at protecting the bulk electric system from physical and cyber threats.

The ERO or the regional entities, such as WECC, may enforce the reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight or FERC may independently enforce reliability standards. Potential monetary sanctions include fines of up to $1,544,521 per violation per day. Order 693 provides ERO and regional entities with 

A-65
<!-- Page 207 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the discretion necessary to assess penalties for such violations, while also having discretion to calculate a penalty without collecting the penalty if circumstances warrant.

**Anti-Market Manipulation Rules.** EPAct of 2005 gave FERC the authority to issue rules to prevent market manipulation in jurisdictional wholesale power and gas markets, and in jurisdictional transmission and transportation services. These anti-market manipulation rules apply to non-jurisdictional entities such as SMUD. Further, EPAct of 2005 provided FERC civil penalty authority, which the Commission has stated that it will exercise carefully by assuring that its market manipulation rules are clear.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions.** Since 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions from different sources, including from the electric sector.

In 2014, EPA issued a proposed rule under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) called the Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”) that projected power sector emissions reductions of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed CPP would have established a rate-based emissions goal for each state, providing states the responsibility to develop a State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) describing how each will meet the goal assigned by EPA using the “Best System of Emissions Reduction” (“BSER”) established by EPA. The rule was finalized in October 2015.

In November 2015, 27 states and numerous corporations challenged the CPP in court, alleging that EPA had exceeded its authority under the CAA; however, before the issue could be decided by the court, the 2016 presidential election resulted in a change of administration. The new administration quickly moved for an abeyance (or stay) of the case for as long as the agency needed to review and withdraw the CPP. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP pending disposition in the D.C. Circuit and any subsequent review by the Supreme Court. In August 2018, EPA proceeded to withdraw the CPP and the D.C. Circuit ultimately dismissed the case on September 17, 2019. EPA proposed a different rule under the same provision of the CAA, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which would have established a BSER that only includes measures that can be undertaken at an individual power plant, rather than the broader suite of measures envisioned under the CPP. The ACE rule was challenged in court by environmental groups and states alleging that the revised rule inadequately responds to EPA’s responsibility to protect public health and welfare. SMUD joined in this litigation along with other challengers. The D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule on January 19, 2021, and remanded it to the EPA for review and revision, just days before a new presidential administration took office. Several states led by West Virginia and coal industry members appealed the decision.

In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in West Virginia v. EPA, striking down the CPP and foreclosing any future regulations of “significant political and economic significance” if Congress has not expressly authorized them. While the decision does not restrict EPA to only requiring measures “inside the fence line” at an individual power plant to control GHGs, it appears unlikely that the EPA will be able to require material reductions in GHGs to mitigate climate change through section 111(d) of the CAA.

Under the new presidential administration, in May 2023, the EPA issued a proposed rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA to reduce GHG emissions from existing and new power plants. The four-part proposed rule, **New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; and Repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy Rule**, would set both GHG emission standards for certain subcategories of new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants operating greater than 50% of the time and generating more than 300 MW per turbine. In the proposed rule, EPA determined the BSER is either deploying carbon capture and storage

technology to capture 90% of emissions or co-firing 96% hydrogen produced through a low-emission process (“low-GHG hydrogen”). If finalized, compliance is required by 2032. SMUD has filed comments as part of several trade groups and coalitions in response to the proposed rule. SMUD’s internal analysis shows the rule as proposed would not require changes at any of its currently-operating fossil-fueled power plants and therefore will not have a material impact on SMUD’s financial position, operations, or liquidity.

**Federal Communications Commission**

The 1978 Pole Attachment Act added section 224 to the Communications Act of 1934, authorizing the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to regulate attachments by cable television systems or providers of telecommunications service to utility poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way. Under Section 224(a)(1), public power entities are exempt from FCC pole attachment regulations, as municipally-owned poles are already subject to local decision-making processes and governance. The municipal exemption from FCC pole attachment regulations was further codified through the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, over the past decade, this exemption has been continuously eroded.

Various actions by the FCC have limited the exemption in support of a “uniform policy for broadband access to privately-owned physical infrastructure.” Through four orders issued between 2017 and 2018, the FCC set strict time limits for the review of pole attachment applications and preempted state and local agreements on pole attachments. In 2020, in *City of Portland v. United States*, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the FCC’s Small Cell Order, which adopted new time limits for municipal utilities’ review of wireless infrastructure siting applications and preempted access for small cell installations. In November 2023, the FCC adopted its Fourth Report and Order, Declaratory Ruling, and Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which established new rules and the timeline for the approval process for pole attachment applications, among other things. SMUD will monitor this proceeding for any potential impact to SMUD.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new FCC rulemakings will impact the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system.

**Federal Clean Energy Legislation.** SMUD actively participates in discussion at the federal level regarding legislation that would meaningfully impact SMUD’s existing GHG reduction strategies or impose new requirements for electric generators, including a proposed federal clean energy standard. In the 117th Congress, a clean electricity performance program was considered but ultimately lacked support to pass. Instead, Congress extended and expanded clean energy tax credits and created new grant and rebate programs to incentivize clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While it is possible that a future Congress may revisit the concept of a clean energy standard or other GHG reduction regime, it is possible that the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will diminish the likelihood of a new regulatory framework being enacted in the near future.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new EPA rulemakings will be undertaken, and what the full impact of the reduction of fossil-based generation over time will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the electric utility industry generally.

**State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings**

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills provide for reduced GHG emission standards and greater investment in energy efficient and environmentally friendly generation alternatives through more stringent RPS. Additionally, ongoing regulatory proceedings address the implementation of these bills as well as water flow and quality.

![Greenhouse Gas Emissions Summary](https://example.com/image.png)

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
On September 27, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (“AB 32”). AB 32 requires the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to adopt enforceable GHG emission limits and emission reduction measures in order to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In addition, AB 32 establishes a mandatory reporting program for all IOUs, local, publicly-owned electric utilities and other load-serving entities (electric utilities providing energy to end-use customers) (“LSEs”). The AB 32 reporting program allows CARB to adopt regulations using market-based compliance mechanisms such as a “cap-and-trade” system.

On December 16, 2010, CARB approved a resolution adopting cap-and-trade regulations for the State. The regulations became effective on January 1, 2012. As adopted, the cap-and-trade program covers sources accounting for 85% of the State’s GHG emissions, the largest program of its type in the United States. In November of 2012, CARB conducted its first allowance auction and auctions now occur on a quarterly schedule.

The cap-and-trade program introduced a hard emissions cap that declines over time on the combined electric utility and large industrial sectors, covering all sources emitting more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases (“CO2e”) per year, and was subsequently expanded to cover distributors of transportation, natural gas, and other fossil fuels. The cap-and-trade program requires covered entities to retire compliance instruments (allowances and carbon offsets) for each metric ton of CO2e they emit. CARB has allocated allowances to LSEs to mitigate the compliance cost burden on ratepayers. The value of allowances must be used to benefit ratepayers and achieve GHG emission purposes (not exceeding 8% of a regulated entity’s compliance obligation through 2020, 4% from 2021 through 2025, and 6% from 2026 through 2030). Offsets must be obtained from certified projects in sectors that are not regulated under the cap-and-trade program and are subject to other restrictions.

The State's cap-and-trade program was briefly linked to companion program in the Canadian province of Ontario during 2018 but was de-linked following a political change. In 2021, the Washington state legislature passed a cap-and-trade bill, which is expected to interact with the State’s markets. Future potential near-term links to the CARB cap-and-trade program also include the states of Oregon, which has adopted a cap-and-trade program, and New Mexico, which is considering the adoption of a cap-and-trade program.

On October 7, 2015, SB 350 was enacted, containing aggressive goals for reducing carbon emissions by 2030, including raising the proportion of renewable energy to 50%, reducing the use of petroleum fuel in cars and trucks by up to 50%, and doubling the energy efficiency of existing buildings. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” for additional information. In addition, SB 350 established requirements for larger POUs to adopt and file with the CEC Integrated Resource Plans (“IRPs”) by April 2019 that should planned procurement to achieve the 50% RPS and State GHG goals established by CARB. The CEC developed “guidelines” for these IRPs for POUs in 2017, updated them in 2018, and proposed additional updates in 2022. CARB established specific GHG target ranges for these IRPs in summer 2018, which were revised in 2023 following the adoption of CARB’s 2022 Scoping Plan. SMUD developed and adopted an IRP in 2018 through a comprehensive public process and filed the adopted IRP with the CEC in April 2019. SMUD adopted an updated IRP in June 2022 and filed the updated IRP with the CEC in September 2022, but the CEC has not yet completed its review of SMUD’s 2022 IRP. SMUD’s updated IRP plans for a greater than 92% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 relative to 1990 levels, which equals approximately

On April 29, 2015, the Governor of the State signed Executive Order B-30-15, establishing a goal for the State to reduce GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2016, the State Legislature passed Senate Bill 32 (“SB 32”), which codified then-Governor Brown’s goal of reducing the State’s GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2017, the State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 398 (“AB 398”), explicitly authorizing the continuation of the cap-and-trade program, with designated changes, through 2030. Subsequently, CARB adopted an initial set of regulatory changes extending the cap-and-trade program, including establishing utility sector allowance allocations through 2030. In 2018, CARB completed a rulemaking to implement the cap-and-trade program changes designated by AB 398. These changes include development of a hard price ceiling for the cap-and-trade program and two price-containment points below that ceiling, in an attempt to ensure stable prices in the program. CARB adopted final regulations on December 13, 2018.

In addition, any new projects constructed in the State, including power plants, that may cause a significant adverse impact on the environment must be analyzed under CEQA. Some State agencies have begun using CEQA in novel ways to require mitigation of “significant” GHG emissions caused, either directly or indirectly, by a project. Pursuant to Senate Bill 97 passed in 2007, CARB will assist the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research in setting thresholds of significance under CEQA of GHG impacts from new projects. This is an area of State law that is evolving and unsettled in the courts. However, there is a risk that any project proponent of an electric system infrastructure project might have to mitigate such potential impacts to a level of less than significant.

On December 3, 2012, the Superior Court issued a ruling in California Redwood Forest Foundation v. San Diego Association of Governments (“SANDAG”), Case No. 2100-00101593, that sided with the State Attorney General and the other petitioners stating that SANDAG did not follow CEQA when it adopted a $257 billion regional transportation plan in 2011. The ruling expressly invalidated the certification of the Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) on the grounds that the EIR should have analyzed the plan’s consistency with the governor’s policy goal to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050 as articulated in the 2005 Executive Order S-03-05. On November 24, 2014, the Fourth Appellate District upheld the trial court in a published decision, and SANDAG appealed to the State Supreme Court. On July 13, 2017, the Supreme Court reversed and held that SANDAG’s decision to not adopt the 2050 goal was not an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, the Court articulated three clear principles for agencies to follow in their CEQA review of planning documents: 1) agencies must take seriously the significance of even small increases in GHG emissions; 2) they must consider science-based State policy guidance in their decision-making; and 3) they are required to use the best scientific information available to determine whether their planning decisions are consistent with the State’s goals. These principles will apply to SMUD in CEQA reviews of future projects.

On September 29, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law Senate Bill 1368 (“SB 1368”), the GHG Emissions Performance Standard (“EPS”). SB 1368 limits long-term investments in baseload generation by the State’s utilities to power plants that meet an EPS jointly established by the CEC and the CPUC. The agencies have set the EPS at 1,100 pounds CO2 per MWh, which is roughly half of the CO2 emissions rate of a conventional coal-fired power plant. CEC regulations to implement the law for POUs were approved by the Office of Administrative Law on October 16, 2007.

SMUD’s primary supply and demand-side resources need to meet customers’ electric usage patterns over the next 10 years. Currently there is a ban in the State that prohibits the development of nuclear power plants until there is a permanent storage solution for spent fuel rods. With the effective ban on new coal power imports under SB 1368, natural gas-fired, combined cycle power plants would appear

A-69
<!-- Page 211 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to be the primary viable option for fossil fuel-based baseload power plant development absent the implementation of new technologies in connection with other resource options. The reliance on a single fuel source will continue to put pressure on the natural gas market in the United States. SMUD has in place a natural gas procurement plan to mitigate natural gas volatility, see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply” above.

On September 16, 2022, the Governor of the State signed into law SB 1020, which creates interim climate targets under which eligible renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources must supply 90% of all retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers by December 31, 2035, and 95% by December 31, 2040. The bill also requires each State agency to ensure that zero carbon resources and eligible renewable energy resources supply 100% of electricity procured on its behalf by December 31, 2035. SMUD provides electricity to a number of State agency buildings and will work with State agencies to comply with this requirement.

On October 7, 2023, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 1305, which requires an entity that purchases or uses voluntary carbon offsets and makes claims regarding the achievement of net zero, or other similar claims, to disclose on their website specified information. Many stakeholder groups are raising questions on if this includes RECs. Clean-up legislation could follow. It is not clear at this time whether RECs are included.

Reliability. On June 30, 2022, the Governor signed the 2022-23 budget, along with a number of trailer bills, which provide implementing details on the budget line items. Included in AB 205, the energy trailer bill, are a number of reliability programs.

1. CEC Distributed Electricity Backup Assets Program to incentivize the construction of cleaner and more efficient distributed energy assets that would serve as on-call emergency supply or load reduction for the state’s electrical grid during extreme events. The CEC adopted program guidelines in October 2023 and issued the first solicitation in December 2023.

2. CEC Demand Side Grid Support Program to pay customers to reduce demand during stressed grid events. SMUD has actively engaged the CEC on the development and subsequent revision of program guidelines. The CEC is expected to revise the guidelines again for summer 2024.

3. DWR Strategic Reliability Reserve to secure resources for summer reliability or to preserve the option to extend the life of facilities that otherwise would retire, new temporary generators of more than five MW, new energy storage systems of at least 20 MW, generation facilities that use clean, zero-emission fuel technologies, or new zero-emission technologies that can be operational by December 31, 2026.

As a follow up to this legislation, the Governor signed into law AB 1373. The bill authorizes the CEC to annually assess a capacity payment on a POU within the CAISO balancing authority area during a month in which the POU fails to meet its minimum planning reserve margin. This does not include SMUD, who is within the BANC balancing authority area. SMUD is, however, required to submit to the CEC an assessment of whether it exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin and system resource adequacy requirements. This bill also allows the DWR, for certain types of long-development projects, to act as a central procurement entity. For POUs, participation in the DWR program would be optional.

Zero-Emission Fleet Mandates. CARB has adopted the Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”) regulation, requiring certain medium- and heavy-duty (“MHD”) vehicle fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles through purchase requirements or fleet composition requirements, which took effect on November

A-70
<!-- Page 212 -->
1, 2023, and applies to all publicly owned MHD fleets, larger commercially owned MHD fleets, and drayage trucks. Under the ACF Rule, public fleets like SMUD have two compliance options. The first is a zero-emission vehicle (“ZEV”) purchase requirement, under which 50% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2024, and 100% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2027. The second is an optional ZEV milestone option, under which the composition of the MHD fleet would need to meet certain ZEV percentages starting in 2025, with the entire fleet transitioned no later than 2042. The individual milestones depend on the number and category of vehicles in the fleet. Public fleets may opt into the ZEV milestone option until January 1, 2030. In 2024, SMUD plans to comply with the purchase requirement option, meaning that 50% of the MHD vehicles purchased in 2024 will be ZEVs. SMUD plans to monitor ZEV market developments and currently expects to opt into the ZEV milestone option as more ZEVs become available. The ACF Rule also accelerates a manufacturer ZEV sales requirement to 100% of all MHD truck sales by the 2036 model year.

CARB proposed the Zero-Emission Forklift regulation in November 2023. The regulation would require forklift fleets to transition spark-ignited forklifts to zero-emission technology starting in 2026. The regulation would apply to SMUD, as a forklift operator. Since SMUD has a limited number of forklifts, this regulation is not expected to have a material effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operation.

Transportation and Building Electrification. In recent years, the State has identified transportation and building electrification as key strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, and is advancing policy to support or accelerate electrification. For example, in addition to the zero-emission fleet mandates and LCFS regulation discussed herein, CARB adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks regulations to require vehicle manufacturers to increase sales of zero-emission vehicles and trucks, respectively. The CEC’s Building Energy Efficiency Standards are also encouraging the use of electric heat pumps in new homes and certain non-residential buildings across the state. The draft 2025 Energy Standards, which are expected to be proposed by April 2024 and adopted by August 2024, would establish prescriptive heat pump requirements for both space and water heating in new homes, and may require existing homes to install a heat pump when replacing an air conditioner. The 2025 Energy Standards, if approved, would take effect on January 1, 2025. In addition, the State has also provided funding for programs to encourage clean transportation and building electrification.

Increases in transportation and building electrification will result in increased customer usage of electricity.

Renewables Portfolio Standard. Senate Bill 100 was passed by the Legislature and approved by Governor Brown on September 10, 2018. Among other requirements, the bill sets a 50% RPS target for 2026 and sets compliance period targets at 44% by December 31, 2024, 52% by December 31, 2027, and 60% by December 31, 2030. The bill also creates a statewide planning goal to meet all of the state’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.

Sacramento-San Joaquin River Bay-Delta Processes. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is an expansive inland estuary, formed at the western edge of the California Central Valley by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers (“Delta”). There are two substantial Delta planning processes with the potential to affect (1) energy available for SMUD’s purchase from the Central Valley Project (“CVP”) and (2) flows within the Upper American River watershed. These processes are called the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan (“Bay-Delta Plan”) and the Delta Conveyance Project.

The Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan is updated periodically by the State Water Resources Control Board (“SWRCB”), the last time being in 2006. The current Bay-Delta Plan update process is being implemented in four phases. The first phase considered southern Delta water quality, with a

A-71
<!-- Page 213 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+not+displayed)  
significant focus on San Joaquin River tributaries. Phase 2, which is initially being addressed by a document under development by SWRCB staff, will address Sacramento River tributaries and various flow related issues, including the critically important one of those tributaries’ contribution to Delta outflow. Phase 3 will concern changes to water rights needed to implement Phase 2. A substantial change in Delta outflow requirements could have a major impact on the timing of hydroelectric energy generation by the CVP. SMUD has a long-term agreement with WAPA to purchase some of this power (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration”). On July 18, 2018, the SWRCB released an updated Framework document signaling its staff’s intent to propose Delta outflow requirements of 45-65% unimpaired flows for the Sacramento River tributaries (which includes the American River, the upper portions of which are where the AQR sits), though the report will analyze requirements of 35-75%. If these criteria were implemented, they could cut CVP generation by 50 to 63%. Governor Newsom has urged the SWRCB, other agencies and affected parties to execute voluntary agreements (aka the “Healthy Rivers Agreements”) to address species’ needs and outflow requirements. Although the negotiations have been slow, it is expected they will eventually result in a reasonable compromise. However, in September 2023 the SWRCB released a Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document in Support of Potential Updates to the Bay-Delta Plan (the “Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document”) to justify the adoption of the unimpaired flow standard as set forth in the 2018 Framework document. Numerous public entities, including SMUD, filed comments stating that, among other things, the potential updates identified in the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document, if adopted, would violate the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act and Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution, would not protect fish and wildlife, and would not reasonably protect all beneficial uses, including water supplies for millions of Californians and hydroelectric power generation that is essential to California’s resilient energy grid. Moreover, the comments filed also stated that the Staff Report/Substitute Environmental Document has not complied with CEQA because, among other things, the analysis of the proposed information and hydroelectric power generation facilities, including generally electrical grid reliability, is not supported by substantial evidence and fails to satisfy informational requirements. In addition, the comments maintain that the Healthy Rivers Agreements are a superior approach to achieving the goal of maximizing both environmental and other beneficial uses. If the unimpaired flow standard is adopted and the Healthy Rivers Agreements do not come to fruition, SMUD plans to fully participate in all regulatory and legal proceedings to argue for consideration and minimization of impacts to hydropower generation. SMUD will assess the potential impacts of proposed modifications to the present outflow objectives on SMUD’s operations once, or if, the SWRCB makes available information with enough specificity for SMUD to conduct the relevant modeling.

In July 2022, the DWR released a Draft Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) to evaluate the potential impacts of carrying out the Delta Conveyance Project; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a separate Environmental Impact Statement to evaluate the effects of the project pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act. The Delta Conveyance Project is expected to entail construction of two intakes on the Sacramento River that will carry water to a main tunnel to the California Aqueduct for delivery south of the Delta. The Delta Conveyance Project may pose the potential to exacerbate impacts to already imperiled aquatic species, and in turn could have indirectly prompted regulatory agencies to require third parties, such as SMUD, to compensate by making changes to their operations. The Bureau of Reclamation is not a party to the Delta Conveyance Project, which should eliminate the potential for CVP power to be used to supply Delta Conveyance Project pumps. SMUD will monitor the proceedings and participate as necessary to ensure any impacts to SMUD interests are minimized, including potentially filing a challenge to the water rights DWR would need to modify in order to carry out the project.

Proposition 26. Proposition 26 was approved by the electorate on November 2, 2010 and amends Article XIII A and Article XIII C of the State Constitution. Proposition 26 imposes a two-thirds voter approval requirement for the imposition of fees and charges by the State, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. It also imposes a majority voter approval requirement on local governments with  
A-72
<!-- Page 214 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**A-73**

**respect to fees and charges for general purposes, and a two-thirds voter approval requirement with respect to fees and charges for special purposes, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. The initiative, according to its supporters, is intended to prevent the circumvention of tax limitations imposed by the voters pursuant to Proposition 13, approved in 1978, and other measures through the use of non-tax fees and charges. Proposition 26 expressly excludes from its scope a charge imposed for a specific local government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable cost to the local government of providing the service or product. Proposition 26 is not retroactive as applied to local governments. Although SMUD believes that the initiative was not intended to apply to fees for utility services such as those charged by SMUD and its fees and charges meet the criteria of the exclusion described above, it is possible that Proposition 26 could be interpreted to further limit fees and charges for electric utility services and/or require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes. SMUD is unable to predict at this time how Proposition 26 will be interpreted by the courts or what its ultimate impact will be. As of the date of this Official Statement, SMUD is unaware of any fees or charges relating to SMUD’s service that would have to be reduced or eliminated because of Proposition 26. However, certain of SMUD’s adopted rate increases have been challenged. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”**

**Initiative 1935.** A voter initiative entitled “The Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act” (“Initiative 1935”) has been determined to be eligible for the State’s November 2024 statewide general election and, unless withdrawn by its proponent prior to June 27, 2024, will be certified as qualified for the ballot in such election. Were it to be approved by a majority of voters in the election, Initiative 1935 would amend Article XIII C of the State Constitution to, among other things, provide that charges (or increases in charges) imposed or extended by a local government after January 1, 2022 for services or products provided directly to the payor (including, potentially, fees and charges for electric service or product) are “taxes” subject to voter approval unless the local government can provide convincing evidence that the charge is reasonable and does not exceed the “actual cost” of providing the service or product. Initiative 1935 defines “actual cost” as “(i) the minimum amount necessary to reimburse the government for the cost of providing the service or the product to the payor and (ii) where the amount charged is not used by the government for any purpose other than reimbursing that cost.” Initiative 1935 would also require that local governments impose fees and charges by ordinance (which may be subject to judicial enforcement). If adopted, Initiative 1935 would be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is unable to predict whether and how Initiative 1935, if approved, would be interpreted or applied, but it is possible any such interpretation or application could further limit future fees and charges or further increase in fees and charges for electric utility services, require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes and/or otherwise adversely impact SMUD and its revenues. In response to an emergency petition filed by Governor Gavin Newsom, with support from the League of California Cities and others, the California Supreme Court has unanimously agreed to decide whether the initiative should appear on the November 2024 ballot or be disqualified. A ruling is expected before June 30, 2024, which is the deadline for placing items on the November 2024 ballot. 

**On November 2, 2023, Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 13 (“ACA 13”) was filed with the Secretary of State and will be on the ballot for the November 2024 statewide general election. If approved by voters, ACA 13 would require any initiative constitutional amendment appearing on the ballot on or after January 1, 2024, that would increase the voter approval requirement to adopt any State or local measure to be approved by the highest voter approval requirement that the initiative measure would impose. In other words, if ACA 13 is approved by voters, its express terms appear to require Initiative 1935 to pass with a 2/3 vote, since Initiative 1935 would extend a 2/3 voter requirement to additional State and local fees and charges. If adopted, ACA 13 and its effect on the adoption of Initiative 1935, if applicable, are likely to be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is not able to predict whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would be interpreted or applied or whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would affect the adoption, interpretation or application of Initiative 1935, if adopted.**

![Wildfire Legislation](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Wildfire Legislation.** In response to catastrophic wildfires in California, legislation was adopted and signed into law requiring POUs (including SMUD), IOUs, and electrical cooperatives to construct, maintain and operate their electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by electrical lines and equipment. Senate Bill 247 (“SB 247”), signed by Governor Newsom on October 2, 2019, establishes notification, audit and reporting guidelines for electrical corporations relating to vegetation management requirements in the wildfire mitigation plan. SB 247 also specifies the qualifications for electrical line clearance tree trimmers performing work to comply with the vegetation management requirements in an electrical corporation’s wildfire mitigation plan and requires that qualified line clearance tree trimmers be paid no less than a specified prevailing wage rate. POUs are not required to adhere to SB 247, but the market impacts are projected to significantly increase SMUD’s annual vegetation management costs.

**Nonstock Security.** SMUD sponsored legislation in 2019, Assembly Bill 689, which was signed into law by Governor Newsom on September 5, 2019. This bill expressly allows SMUD the ability to operate a pilot project (effective January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2025), of up to three acquisitions, to hold nonstock security in a corporation or other private entity if acquired as part of a procurement of goods or services from that entity, provided that no separate funding is expended solely for the nonstock security. This will allow SMUD to realize the financial benefits of its investments, partnerships, and intellectual property.

On September 15, 2022, the Board authorized the CEO & GM to enter into a joint collaboration agreement with ESS Tech, Inc. (“ESS”). Under that agreement SMUD would procure from ESS in flow batteries for utility scale long-duration energy storage applications. The agreement contemplates a multi-year phased deployment of up to 200MW/2GWh of long duration energy storage by 2028. As part of this procurement, SMUD acquired nonstock security in ESS.

SMUD will be sponsoring legislation in 2024 to extend the authority granted by Assembly Bill 689 to future years.

**Future Regulation**

The electric industry is subject to continuing legislative and administrative reform. States and Federal entities routinely consider changes to the way in which they regulate the electric industry. Recently, both further deregulation and forms of additional regulation have been proposed for the industry, which has been highly regulated throughout its history. SMUD is unable to predict at this time the impact any such proposals will have on the operations and finances of SMUD or the electric utility industry generally.

**OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY**

**CAISO Market Initiatives**

The CAISO routinely conducts a number of initiatives and stakeholder processes that propose certain operational and market changes that impact SMUD. SMUD does and will continue to monitor the various initiatives proposed by the CAISO and participate in its stakeholder processes to ensure that its interests are protected.

SMUD participates in the CAISO market for only a small percentage of energy needs, however, it continues to benefit from its participation in the CAISO’s WEIM and is currently exploring further participation in the CAISO’s proposed Extended Day Ahead Market (“EDAM”) (both the WEIM and EDAM are described further below). Along with monitoring other key market initiatives at the CAISO which impact wholesale energy markets, SMUD will continue to actively participate in all processes related

A-74
<!-- Page 216 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to EIM and EDAM, to ensure both participation models are beneficial to SMUD’s customers. Given its success in EIM and active engagement with the CAISO and CAISO leadership, SMUD has earned a key role in the stakeholder processes related to these important and evolving markets.

**Resource Adequacy Filing**

In September 2005, the State Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Assembly Bill 380 (“AB 380”), which requires the CPUC to establish resource adequacy requirements for all LSEs within the CPUC’s jurisdiction. SMUD is not an LSE subject to the CPUC’s jurisdiction. In 2005, the CPUC issued a decision requiring jurisdictional LSEs to demonstrate that they have acquired capacity sufficient to serve their forecast retail customer load plus a minimum 15% planning reserve margin. In June 2022, the CPUC issued a decision increasing the minimum planning reserve margin to 16% for 2023 and 17% for 2024. In June 2023, the CPUC kept the minimum planning reserve margin at 17% for 2024 and extended the 17% requirement for 2025.

AB 380 also required publicly owned utilities, including SMUD, to meet the most recent resource adequacy standard as adopted by the WECC. The WECC has yet to formally adopt a resource adequacy requirement. However, consistent with current WECC practices, SMUD utilizes a minimum 15% planning reserve margin when assessing the need for future resources. For summer 2023, SMUD attained a 17% planning reserve margin and will have at least a 17% planning reserve margin for summer 2024 as well.

In 2022, the State Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 209 (2022) (“AB 209”), which requires the CEC to develop recommendations about approaches to determining an appropriate planning reserve margin for local publicly owned utilities within the CAISO balancing authority area. The CEC has initiated a proceeding and plans to publish a report with a recommended methodology on summer 2024. The report will not directly impact SMUD since SMUD is not in the CAISO; nevertheless, SMUD is monitoring the proceeding. The State Legislature also passed Assembly Bill 1373 (2023) (“AB 1373”) that requires the CEC to submit a report to the Legislature that assesses whether each local publicly owned electric utility in California (both inside and outside the CAISO) exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin for 2023. The report must also assess whether local publicly owned utilities met the planning reserve margin for June through September 2023 established by the CPUC’s June 2022 decision (i.e., 16%). See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Reliability.”

While SMUD believes the CEC’s report will show SMUD met both its 15% planning reserve margin and the CPUC’s 16% planning reserve margin for 2023, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the report, or what the Legislature intends to do with the report. To the extent the CEC or Legislature imposes a higher POU planning reserve margin for future years that includes SMUD, the ultimate impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy/capacity, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers; however, such impacts could be material.

**Western Energy Imbalance Market and Extended Day Ahead Market**

Federal and state policymakers have long-promoted the development of organized markets in the west as a means (among other reasons) to better integrate intermittent renewable resources into the electric system, the first of which markets is the Western EIM, operated by the CAISO. The CAISO successfully launched the WEIM, a real time only imbalance market, on October 1, 2014, with PacifiCorp as the first participant. Since this time, the WEIM has grown significantly with the addition of 21 other Balancing

to sell to nongovernmental entities electricity from generation projects and transmission service from transmission line projects financed with tax exempt obligations; (i) effects of inflation on the operating and maintenance costs of an electric utility and its facilities; (j) changes from projected future load requirements; (k) increases in costs and uncertain availability of capital; (l) issues relating to supply chains and the uncertain availability or increased costs of necessary materials; (m) shifts in the availability and relative costs of different fuels (including the cost of natural gas); (n) sudden and dramatic increases in the price of energy purchased on the open market that may occur at times of high peak demand in an area of the country experiencing such high peak demand, such as has occurred in the State; (o) issues relating to risk management procedures and practices with respect to, among other things, the purchase and sale of natural gas, energy and transmission capacity; (p) other legislative changes, voter initiatives, referenda and statewide propositions; (q) effects of changes in the economy; (r) effects of possible manipulation of the electric markets; (s) natural disasters or other physical calamities, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, droughts, severe weather, wildfires and floods; (t) changes to the climate, including increasing volatility in rainfall in the Western United States and a reduction in the depth and duration of the Sierra snowpack; (u) issues relating to cyber-security; and (v) outbreaks of infectious diseases or the occurrence of pandemics. Any of these factors (as well as other factors) could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of any given electric utility, including SMUD’s electric utility, and likely will affect individual utilities in different ways.

SMUD is unable to predict what impact such factors will have on the business operations and financial condition of SMUD’s electric system, but the impact could be significant. SMUD has taken major steps to mitigate the impacts of many of the changes. This Official Statement includes a brief discussion of certain of these factors. This discussion does not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and matters are subject to change subsequent to the date hereof. Extensive information on the electric utility industry is available from the legislative and regulatory sources and other sources in the public domain, and potential purchasers of any of SMUD’s Senior Bonds or Subordinated Bonds described in the forepart of this Official Statement should obtain and review such information.

# APPENDIX C
## BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

The information in this Appendix regarding DTC has been provided by DTC, and SMUD takes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness thereof. SMUD cannot and does not give any assurances that DTC, DTC Participants or Indirect Participants will distribute the Beneficial Owners either (a) payments of interest or principal with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds or (b) certificates representing ownership interest in or other confirmation of ownership interest in the 2024 Series M Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis or that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this Official Statement.

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the 2024 Series M Bonds. The 2024 Series M Bonds will be issued as fully registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of the 2024 Series M Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.

DTC, the world’s largest depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 instruments from over 100 countries that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others, such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.

Purchases of the 2024 Series M Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the 2024 Series M Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each 2024 Series M Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their beneficial ownership interests in the 2024 Series M Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the 2024 Series M Bonds is discontinued.

SMUD may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, bond certificates for such 2024 Series M Bonds will be printed and delivered to DTC.

Neither SMUD or the Trustee will have any responsibility or obligation to Participants, to Indirect Participants or to any Beneficial Owner with respect to (i) the accuracy of any records maintained by DTC, any Participant, or any Indirect Participant; (ii) the payment by DTC or any Participant or Indirect Participant of any amount with respect to the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds; (iii) any notice which is permitted or required to be given to Holders under the Resolution; (iv) the selection by DTC, any Participant or any Indirect Participant of any person to receive payment in the event of a partial redemption of 2024 Series M Bonds; (v) any consent given or other action taken by DTC as Bondholder; or (vi) any other procedures or obligations of DTC, Participants or Indirect Participants under the book-entry system.

## SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Resolution. Other provisions of the Resolution are described under the captions “THE 2024 SERIES M BONDS” and “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS.” This summary is not to be considered a full statement of the terms of the Resolution and accordingly is qualified by reference thereto and is subject to the full text thereof. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Official Statement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

Between July 1997 and August 2003, SMUD received consents to amend the Resolution from the owners of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Bonds. Pursuant to the authority granted by such consents, SMUD amended the Resolution in October 2003 by adopting the Forty-Eighth Supplemental Resolution. The following summary of the Resolution reflects such amendments.

The purchasers of the 2024 Series M Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series M Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution (the “Proposed Amendments”). Such amendments are described in **bold italic** font in the forepart of this Official Statement under “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Rates and Charges” and “– Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues” and in this summary of the Resolution under the captions “Certain Definitions” and “Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds.” The written consents to the Proposed Amendments of the holders and registered owners of at least 60% of the Bonds outstanding have been filed with SMUD or the Trustee, as required by the Resolution. However, while certain Bonds remain outstanding SMUD must also obtain the written consents of the holders and registered owners of the Proposed Amendments to implement the Proposed Amendments when the written consents of such bond insurers are obtained or when the Bonds insured by such bond insurers are no longer outstanding. The final maturity date of the insured Bonds is July 1, 2024.

### Certain Definitions

“Assumed Interest Payments” means for any fiscal year or period interest which would accrue during such fiscal year or period on an amount equal to the then unamortized balance of the remaining sum of Assumed Principal Payments at the Assumed Interest Rate.

“Assumed Interest Rate” for any Parity Bond means an interest rate equal to the “Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index” most recently published in The Bond Buyer prior to the date of issuance of the Parity Bond to which the Assumed Interest Rate is applicable.

“Assumed Principal Payments” means for any fiscal year or period the sum of all amortized portions of each Excluded Principal Payment which fall within such fiscal year or period after the Excluded Principal Payments have been amortized (for purposes of this definition) equally over the years (pro rata in the case of a partial year) in the period commencing on the date of issuance of the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payment relates and ending on the date which is 30 years from such date of issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parity Bonds determined by SMUD to be an Excluded Principal Payment are refinanced with Parity Bonds determined by SMUD to be another Excluded Principal Payment, (1) Assumed Principal Payments with respect to the refinancing Parity Bonds shall not include any amount of principal which has previously been assumed amortized with respect to the refinanced Parity Bonds and (2) the period over which the refinancing Parity Bonds shall be assumed to be amortized shall be the period commencing on the date of issuance of the refinancing Parity Bonds and ending on the date which is 30 years from the date of issuance of the refinanced Parity Bonds.
<!-- Page 224 -->
**“Electric System”** means the entire electric system of SMUD, together with all additions, betterments, extensions and improvements.

**“Energy Payments”** means, when used with respect to the Electric System, all actual costs incurred, or charges made therefor, by SMUD in any particular fiscal year or period to which said term is applicable for purchased power (including power purchased from any special district included within the boundaries of SMUD), electric and thermal energy and capacity under contracts providing for payments by SMUD for electric or thermal energy or capacity whether or not such energy or capacity is delivered or capable of being delivered or otherwise made available to or received by or for the account of SMUD.

**“Excluded Principal Payments”** means each payment of principal on Parity Bonds which the Board of Directors of SMUD determines (on a date not later than the date of issuance of such Parity Bonds) that SMUD intends to refinance at or prior to the maturity date(s) of such Parity Bonds or otherwise to pay with moneys which are not Revenues. No such determination shall affect the security for such Parity Bonds or the obligation of SMUD to pay such payments from Revenues.

**“Financial Products Agreement”** means an interest rate swap, cap, collar, option, floor, forward or other hedging agreement, arrangement or security, however denominated, entered into by SMUD with a Qualified Provider not for investment purposes but with respect to specific Parity Bonds for the purpose of (1) reducing or otherwise managing SMUD’s risk of interest rate changes or (2) effectively converting SMUD’s interest rate exposure, in whole or in part, from a fixed rate exposure to a variable rate exposure, or from a variable rate exposure to a fixed rate exposure.

**“Financial Product Payments”** means amounts periodically required to be paid to a counterparty by SMUD pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement.

**“Financial Product Receipts”** means amounts periodically required to be paid to SMUD by a counterparty pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement.

**“Maintenance and Operation Costs”** means all actual maintenance and operation costs incurred by SMUD (including purchased power and fuel costs) or charges therefor made in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, exclusive in all cases of depreciation, or obsolescence charges or reserves therefor, amortization of intangibles or other entries of a similar nature, interest charges and charges for the payment of principal of SMUD debt.

**“Net Revenues”** for any fiscal period means the sum of (a) the Revenues for such fiscal period plus (b) the amounts, if any, withdrawn by SMUD from the Rate Stabilization Fund for treatment as Revenues for such fiscal period, less the sum of (c) all Maintenance and Operation Costs for such fiscal period, (d) all Energy Payments for such fiscal period not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs for such fiscal period, and (e) the amounts, if any, withdrawn by SMUD from Revenues for such fiscal period for deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund pursuant to the Resolution.

**“Parity Bonds”** includes the Bonds and all revenue bonds issued on a parity with the Bonds as provided or permitted in the Resolution. No Parity Bonds (other than the Bonds) are currently outstanding.

**“Qualified Provider”** means any financial institution or insurance company which is a party to a Financial Products Agreement if the unsecured long-term debt obligations of such financial institution or insurance company (or of the parent or a subsidiary of such financial institution or insurance company if such parent or subsidiary unconditionally guarantees the performance of such financial institution or insurance company under such Financial Products Agreement and the Trustee receives an opinion of
<!-- Page 225 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Rate Stabilization Fund** means the fund by that name established in the Resolution. From time to time, after provision for debt service, SMUD may deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund from remaining Revenues such amounts as SMUD shall determine, provided that deposits may be made until (but not after) the date 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. SMUD may withdraw amounts from the Rate Stabilization Fund only for inclusion in Revenues for any fiscal year, such withdrawals to be made until (but not after) 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. All interest or other earnings on deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be withdrawn therefrom and accounted for as Revenues. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no deposit of Revenues to the Rate Stabilization Fund may be made to the extent such Revenues were included in an engineer’s certificate submitted in connection with the issuance of additional revenue bonds payable from Revenues and withdrawal of the Revenues to be deposited in the Rate Stabilization Fund from the Revenues employed in rendering said engineer’s certificate would have caused noncompliance with the provisions of the Resolution restricting issuance of additional obligations or securities payable from Revenues or to the extent any withdrawal of amounts from remaining Revenues for the Rate Stabilization Fund for any fiscal year would have reduced the debt service ratio referred to in this Appendix under the caption “Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds” to or below 1.40.

**Revenues** means all revenues derived by SMUD from the operation of the Electric System, or arising from the Electric System (consisting primarily of income derived from the sale or use of electric energy generated, transmitted or distributed by SMUD from the Electric System, but also including receipts from the sale of property pertaining to the Electric System or incidental to the operation of the Electric System or from services performed by SMUD in connection with the Electric System and revenues derived from certain wholesale, but not retail, sales of water), but exclusive in every case of any moneys derived from the levy or collection of taxes upon any taxable property in SMUD.

**Subsidy** means any subsidy, reimbursement or other payment from the federal government of the United States of America under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (or any similar legislation or regulation of the federal government of the United States of America or any other governmental entity or extension of any such legislation or regulation).

**Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds**

The Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund (the “Reserve Fund”) is created under the Resolution. The Reserve Fund secures all Bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 that are currently outstanding (and not otherwise deemed to be paid and discharged under the Resolution) and may secure additional Bonds issued in the future. However, the Reserve Fund does not secure and will not be available to pay debt service on the 2024 Series M Bonds.

After the close of each fiscal year, SMUD shall determine the ratio (herein called the “debt service ratio”) of (1) the Net Revenues during such fiscal year to (2) the maximum annual debt service during the period of three fiscal years next following said fiscal year on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding. For this purpose, the term “maximum annual debt service” shall mean the sum of (i) the interest falling due on serial bonds and term bonds, (ii) the principal amount of serial bonds falling due by
<!-- Page 226 -->

their terms, and (iii) the amount of minimum sinking fund payments required, as computed for the year in which such sum shall be a maximum. Interest during construction which has been funded and provided for shall not be included in "minimum annual debt service" for the purpose of the above calculation.

So long as the debt service ratio shall exceed 1.40, the amount required to be maintained in the Reserve Fund shall be an amount such that the amount in the combined reserve funds of all Parity Bonds then outstanding will at no time be less than the current annual interest requirements on all then outstanding Parity Bonds, except only bonds (if any) for which payment has been provided in advance. If the debt service ratio in any fiscal year shall fall below 1.40, the Treasurer shall set aside in the Reserve Fund or in any other reserve fund or funds established for any one or more issues of the Parity Bonds (on or before the first day of each month of the next succeeding fiscal year) from the first available Net Revenues an amount not less than 15% of the sum of the current monthly interest requirements of all Parity Bonds then outstanding until the next year in which the debt service ratio shall exceed 1.40 or until the aggregate amount in the combined reserve funds established for all of the Parity Bonds (including the Reserve Fund) is equal to the maximum annual debt service on all of the Parity Bonds then outstanding, whichever shall first occur.

For purposes of the above calculation, the interest rates of Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period of periods of time, such interest rate or rates for such period or periods, and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period covered by such known period or periods, the interest rate shall be the greater of the numerical maximum rate that such Bonds may vary or be adjusted to and the numerical maximum rate (if any) that the interest rate for such Bonds may be fixed to, in both cases as set forth in the supplemental resolution authorizing such Bonds, or if such rate or rates have been increased in accordance with such supplemental resolution at such increased rate or rates.

Any amount in the Reserve Fund at any time in excess of the balance required to be then maintained therein shall be released to SMUD for any SMUD use.

SMUD shall not be required, notwithstanding anything herein contained, to maintain in the combined reserve funds appertaining to all Parity Bonds of SMUD, an aggregate amount in excess of the maximum annual debt service requirements in any subsequent fiscal year on all of the then outstanding Parity Bonds.

Any moneys at any time in any of said reserve funds shall be held by the Treasurer in trust for the benefit of the holder or holders from time to time of the Bonds and the coupons appertaining thereto entitled to be paid therewith, and SMUD shall not have any beneficial right or interest in any such moneys.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Supplemental Resolution adopted after the Forty-Eighth Supplemental Resolution may provide that a Series of Bonds issued pursuant to such Supplemental Resolution shall not be secured by the Reserve Fund. In such event, (i) payments of the principal of and interest on such Bonds shall be excluded from all calculations made in respect of the amount to be maintained in the Reserve Fund and (ii) amounts on deposit in the Reserve Fund shall not be applied to the payment of the principal of or interest on such Bonds, even if no other moneys are available therefor.

any expiration or termination thereof; provided, however, that no such drawing need be made if other moneys or a letter of credit are available in the Reserve Fund in the amount of the Reserve Fund Requirement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the prior two paragraphs, if at any time that there is on deposit in the Reserve Fund a combination of cash, a letter of credit and/or a surety bond as contemplated above, SMUD shall draw first on such cash to the extent required and available, then on (1) such surety bond and letter of credit on a pro rata basis (if both a surety bond and letter of credit are available) to the extent required and available, or (2) such surety bond or letter of credit (if either a surety bond or letter of credit, but not both, is available) to the extent required and available.

For purposes of calculating the “debt service ratio” and, unless otherwise specified in a Supplemental Resolution providing for the issuance of a series of Parity Bonds, the amount required to be maintained in the Reserve Fund as described above: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Net Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

### Additional Covenants

The Resolution contains the following additional covenants, among others:

1. That the Electric System will be maintained in good repair, working order and condition at all times, and will be continuously operated in an efficient and economical manner.

2. That no electric energy shall be supplied free by SMUD, and a reasonable wholesale charge will be made for water distributed at any cost to SMUD and such charge will be deemed Revenues; but SMUD may supply without charge water furnished to it without distribution cost, and any moneys received from any retail sales of water will not be deemed Revenues.

3. That all taxes and governmental charges and other lawful claims which might become a lien on the Electric System or the Revenues or impair the security of the Bonds will be paid and discharged when due.

4. That SMUD will comply with all lawful orders of any governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction in the premises (except while the validity or application thereof is being contested in good faith) and with all necessary permits and licenses issued by the NRC.

5. That no lease or agreement will be entered into, or sale or other disposition of essential property made, that would impair the operation of the Electric System or the rights of Bondholders with respect to the Revenues; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Master Resolution, SMUD may sell or otherwise dispose of its accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD provided that SMUD delivers to the Trustee:

   (a) a Certificate of SMUD to the effect that the amount derived by SMUD from the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances is a result of the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances upon fair and reasonable terms no
<!-- Page 229 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

less favorable to SMUD than the terms of a comparable arm’s-length transaction treated as a sale and not a loan under generally accepted accounting principles; and  
(b) a written statement or report of an independent certified public accountant to the effect that, based on the audited financial statements of SMUD for the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available and after giving effect to such transaction by reducing Revenues for such fiscal year by the difference between the face amount of such accounts receivable or loan balances and the amount derived by SMUD from the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances, the debt service ratio computed pursuant to the Master Resolution would not have been reduced to less than 1.40:1.0.

6. That proper records and accounts will be maintained of all transactions relating to the Electric System and the Revenues (open to inspection by the Trustee and the holders of not less than 10 percent in principal amount of the Bonds), to be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant within 90 days after close of the fiscal year, and copies of such financial statements supplied to Bondholders on request.

7. That insurance adequate in amounts and as to risks covered will be maintained against such risks as are usually insurable in connection with similar electric systems, and in addition public liability and property damage insurance in amounts not less than $1,000,000 per accident and adequate fidelity bonds on all officers and employees of SMUD handling or responsible for SMUD funds, subject in each case to the condition that such insurance is obtainable at reasonable rates and upon reasonable terms and conditions. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – INSURANCE” attached to this Official Statement for a description of SMUD’s insurance.

8. That the net proceeds realized by SMUD in the event all or any part of the Electric System is taken by eminent domain proceedings will be applied to the redemption or retirement of all Bonds and Parity Bonds if sufficient therefor, and, if not, then pro rata to the redemption or retirement of Bonds and Parity Bonds or to new facilities if the additional Revenues to be derived therefrom will sufficiently offset the loss of Revenues resulting from such eminent domain so that the ability of SMUD to meet its obligations will not be substantially impaired.

9. That SMUD will at all times use its best efforts to maintain the powers, functions and duties now reposed in it pursuant to law.

10. That SMUD will establish and at all times maintain and collect rates and charges for the sale or use of its electric energy sufficient to permit SMUD to purchase power or issue and sell Bonds or Parity Bonds to finance additions, betterments, extensions and improvements to the Electric System as may be reasonably necessary to satisfy its then projected electric demand upon its Electric System, and that unless the Board determines that SMUD will be able to satisfy such demand through the purchase of electric energy, SMUD will proceed with all reasonable diligence to issue and sell such Bonds or Parity Bonds.

11. That SMUD will not create, or permit the creation of, any mortgage or lien upon the Electric System or any property essential to the proper operation of the Electric System or to the maintenance of the Revenues. SMUD will not create, or permit the creation of, any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon the Revenues except only as provided in the Master Resolution; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Master Resolution, SMUD may create a pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon its accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD (which pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance shall be prior to any pledge, lien, charge or
<!-- Page 230 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

encumbrance created or made pursuant to the Master Resolution, including without limitation the pledge of Revenues made pursuant to the Master Resolution) to secure indebtedness with a term of one year or less provided that the principal amount of such indebtedness does not exceed 50% of the aggregate face amount of the accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD as shown on SMUD’s most recent audited financial statements.

## Amendment of the Resolution

The Resolution and the rights and obligations of SMUD and of the holders of the Bonds may be modified or amended at any time pursuant to the affirmative vote at a meeting of Bondholders, or with the written consent without a meeting, of the holders of 60 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding, provided that no such modification or amendment shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Bond, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Bond so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Bonds required for consent to an amendment or modification, without the consent of the holders of all the Bonds then outstanding. Modifications or amendments may be made, without the consent of any Bondholders, to add covenants of SMUD or to surrender rights reserved by SMUD in the Resolution, to cure ambiguities or defective or inconsistent provisions or in regard to questions arising under the Resolution without adversely affecting the interests of the Bondholders, or to provide for the issuance of a series of Bonds, subject to the provisions contained in the Resolution with respect thereto.

## Events of Default and Remedies of Bondholders

The Resolution declares each of the following to be an event of default:

(a) Failure to pay the principal of and premium on any Bond when due and payable;

(b) Failure to pay any installment of interest on any Bond when due and payable, if such default continues for a period of 30 days;

(c) Default by SMUD in the observance of any of the covenants, agreements or conditions on its part in the Resolution or in the Bonds, if such default continues for a period of 60 days after written notice thereof (specifying such default and requiring the same to be remedied) has been given to SMUD by the Trustee, or to SMUD and the Trustee by the holders of not less than 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time outstanding; and

(d) If, under the provisions of any law for the relief or aid of debtors, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume custody or control of SMUD or of the whole or any substantial part of its property, and such custody or control shall not be terminated or stayed within 60 days;

In the event of default, the Trustee or the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Bonds may, upon written notice to SMUD, declare the principal of all outstanding Bonds, and the interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately. The Trustee is appointed as trustee to represent Bondholders and may take such action as may seem appropriate to it, and, upon the written request of the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Bonds, and upon being furnished with indemnity satisfactory to it, will take such action on behalf of Bondholders as is specified in such written request. Each Bondholder is entitled to proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in such holder by the Resolution by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such holder deems most effectual.
<!-- Page 231 -->
![Page 9](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+9)

The rights of Bondholders are limited and restricted to the use and application of Revenues as provided in the Resolution and do not extend to the levy of any attachment or execution upon or forfeiture of any of the properties of SMUD or to any moneys derived by SMUD from the levy or collection of taxes.

In addition to the limitations on remedies contained in the Resolution, the rights and remedies provided by the Bonds and the Resolution, as well as the enforcement by SMUD of contracts with customers of the Electric System, may be limited by and are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

### Refunding of 2024 Series M Bonds

If Refunding Bonds are issued for the purpose of refunding 2024 Series M Bonds, then SMUD is authorized to apply proceeds of the sale of such Refunding Bonds to the payment of the purchase price of direct noncallable obligations of the United States of America (“Treasury Obligations”) to be held by the Trustee to insure the payment or retirement at or before maturity of all or a portion of the outstanding 2024 Series M Bonds. Upon deposit with the Trustee, in trust, of money or Treasury Obligations (including, but not limited to, direct obligations of the United States of America issued in book-entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury of the United States of America), or any combination thereof, sufficient, together with the interest to accrue on any such Treasury Obligations, to pay or redeem all or a portion of 2024 Series M Bonds then outstanding at or before their maturity date, all liability of SMUD in respect of such 2024 Series M Bonds shall cease, determine and be completely discharged, and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to payment by SMUD of the money and Treasury Obligations deposited with the Trustee for their payment. If the liability of SMUD shall cease and determine with respect to all or a portion of the 2024 Series M Bonds, then said 2024 Series M Bonds shall not be considered to be outstanding Bonds for any purpose of the Resolution.

### Discharge of Resolution

The Resolution may be discharged by depositing with the Trustee in trust, moneys or Federal Securities or general obligation bonds of the State of California, in such amount as the Trustee shall determine will, together with the interest to accrue thereon, be fully sufficient to pay and discharge the indebtedness on all Bonds at or before their respective maturity dates.

### Investment of Funds

Moneys in any fund established by the Resolution may be invested in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, bills, bankers acceptances or other securities in which funds of SMUD may be legally invested as provided by the law in effect at the time of such investment. Currently this investment authority includes, among other things, the Local Agency Investment Fund which is administered by the Treasurer of the State of California for the investment of funds belonging to local agencies in the State of California.

## PROPOSED FORM OF LEGAL OPINION FOR 2024 SERIES M BONDS

[Closing Date]

Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Sacramento, California  

Sacramento Municipal Utility District  
Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M  
(Final Opinion)

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) in connection with the issuance of $ __________ aggregate principal amount of Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Bonds, 2024 Series M (the “2024 Series M Bonds”), issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 of the Board of Directors of SMUD, adopted January 7, 1971 (the “Master Resolution”), as supplemented and amended by later resolutions of said Board of Directors (as so supplemented and amended, the “Resolution”), including Resolution No. 24-03-[__], adopted March 21, 2024 (the “Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Resolution; the Tax Certificate, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”), executed by SMUD; opinions of counsel to SMUD and the Trustee; certificates of SMUD, the Trustee and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after original delivery of the 2024 Series M Bonds on the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after original delivery of the 2024 Series M Bonds on the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not be, relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters. Our engagement with respect to the 2024 Series M Bonds has concluded with their issuance, and we disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures provided to us and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than SMUD. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to in the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes.

or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against governmental entities such as SMUD in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the property described in or as subject to the lien of the Resolution or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein of, or the remedies available to enforce liens on, any such property. Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official Statement, dated ______, 2024, or other offering material relating to the 2024 Series M Bonds and express no opinion or view with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1. The 2024 Series M Bonds constitute the valid and binding obligations of SMUD.

2. The Resolution, including the Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, has been duly adopted by, and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of, SMUD. The Resolution creates a valid pledge, to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds, of the Net Revenues, subject to the provisions of the Resolution permitting the application thereof for the purposes on and the terms and conditions set forth in the Resolution.

3. Interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. We observe that interest on the 2024 Series M Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series M Bonds.

Faithfully yours,

(c) The amendment or waiver either (1) is approved by the Holders of 60% of the 2024 Series M Bonds, or (2) does not, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, materially impair the interests of the Holders or Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series M Bonds.

**PRELIMINARY OFFICIAL STATEMENT DATED |______, 2024**

**NEW ISSUE - FULL BOOK-ENTRY**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD, based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and, assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series N Bonds. See “TAX MATTERS.”

amount of $[________] are expected to be outstanding under the Resolution. See "PLAN OF FINANCE."

Although the Resolution establishes an "Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund" (the "Reserve Fund"), the Reserve Fund does not secure and will not be available to pay debt service on the 2024 Series N Bonds. The Reserve Fund secures all Bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 that are currently outstanding (and not otherwise deemed to be paid and discharged under the Resolution) and may secure additional Bonds issued in the future.

U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association serves as trustee and paying agent under the Resolution (in such capacities, the "Trustee" and the "Paying Agent" respectively).

From time to time, SMUD issues Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the "Subordinated Bonds") pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the "Subordinate Resolution"). As of December 31, 2023, Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 were outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of the Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series N Bonds).

SMUD also issues commercial paper notes (the "Notes") from time to time. As of December 31, 2023, Notes in the principal amount of $150,000,000 were outstanding. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes and SMUD's obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD's Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal, premium if any, and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series N Bonds) and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. SMUD expects to pay all $150,000,000 of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes with a portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds. See "PLAN OF FINANCE."

SMUD has also previously issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes pursuant to a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank (collectively, the "Revolving Credit Facility"). As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility in the future. SMUD's payment obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD's Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Bonds (including the 2024 Series N Bonds) and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

SMUD is responsible for the acquisition, generation, transmission and distribution of electric power to its service area, which includes most of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD served a population of approximately 1.5 million with a total annual retail load of approximately 10,104 million kilowatt hours ("kWh"). SMUD

owns and operates an electric system which, as of December 31, 2023, included generating facilities owned and operated by SMUD with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 775 megawatts (“MW”), local gas-fired plants owned and operated by a joint powers authority managed by SMUD with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 1,087 MW, over which SMUD has exclusive control of dispatch, and purchased power with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 1,590 MW and transmission and distribution facilities. SMUD’s power requirements exceed its generating capacity and thus SMUD has agreements with others (including the Local Gas-Fired Plants as defined in APPENDIX A) for the purchase of a portion of its power requirements. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Supply Resources.” Continuing development of SMUD’s business strategy in response to changing environmental and regulatory requirements has had, and is expected to continue to have, a major effect on SMUD’s power supply planning. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – BUSINESS STRATEGY.”

Pursuant to a Continuing Disclosure Agreement, dated the date of issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds (the “Continuing Disclosure Agreement”) between SMUD and the Trustee, SMUD will covenant for the benefit of the holders of the 2024 Series N Bonds and owners of beneficial interest in the 2024 Series N Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data to provide certain financial

The 2009 Series V Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption upon the occurrence of an “Extraordinary Event.” Pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions for the 2009 Series V Bonds, an “Extraordinary Event” will have occurred if SMUD determines that a material adverse change has occurred to Section 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as such Sections were added by Section 1531 of the Recovery Act, pertaining to Build America Bonds) or there is any guidance published by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury with respect to such Sections or any other determination by the Internal Revenue Service or the United States Treasury, which determination is not the result of an act or omission by SMUD to satisfy the requirements to receive the 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury, pursuant to which SMUD’s 35% cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury is reduced or eliminated.

The 2010 Series W Bonds are subject to extraordinary optional redemption upon the occurrence of a “Tax Law Change.” Pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions for the 2010 Bonds, “Tax Law Change” means legislation has been enacted by the Congress of the United States or passed by either House of the Congress, or a decision has been rendered by a court of the United States, or an order, ruling, regulation (final or proposed) or official statement has been made by or on behalf of the Treasury Department of the United States, the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental agency of appropriate jurisdiction, the effect of which, as reasonably determined by SMUD, would be to suspend, reduce or terminate the payment from the United States Treasury to SMUD with respect to the 2010 Series W Bonds, or to state or local governmental issuers generally with respect to obligations of the general character of the 2010 Series W Bonds, pursuant to Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code of an amount equal to 35% of the interest due thereon on each interest payment date (the “Subsidy Payments”); provided, that such suspension, reduction or termination of the Subsidy Payments is not due to a failure by the District to comply with the requirements under the Code to receive such Subsidy Payments.

The extraordinary optional redemption provisions for each series of the Refunded Bonds are described in the related Official Statement for such series of Refunded Bonds. The Official Statements for the Refunded Bonds can be found at the following links:

2009 Series V Bonds: [Link](https://emma.msrb.org/FP250561-EP406639-EP803941.pdf)

The foregoing links are provided for reference and convenience only. The Official Statements for the Refunded Bonds are not incorporated herein by reference and do not constitute part of this Official Statement.

For various reasons, including but not limited to, the enactment of the Budget Control Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act and the resulting reduction of the cash subsidy payments required to be paid by the United States Treasury to SMUD with respect to the Refunded Bonds pursuant to section 6431 of the Code, SMUD has determined that an “Extraordinary Event” has occurred with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and that a “Tax Law Change” has occurred with respect to the 2010 Series W Bonds. Therefore,

![SMUD Bond Redemption Information](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Bond+Redemption+Information)

SMUD expects to redeem the Refunded Bonds pursuant to the extraordinary optional redemption provisions applicable to each series of the Refunded Bonds.

[A portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds, [together with other available funds], will be deposited in one or more escrow funds (the “Escrow Funds”) established under one or more escrow agreements between SMUD and the Trustee. The moneys so deposited will be invested in direct obligations of the United States of America (the “Federal Securities”), the interest on and principal of which, together with other moneys held in the Escrow Funds, are expected to be in an amount sufficient to pay the interest on the Refunded Bonds due on [____] (the “Redemption Date”) and to redeem the Refunded Bonds on the Redemption Date at their respective redemption prices. [Upon deposit, all liability of SMUD with respect to the Refunded Bonds (except for the obligation of SMUD to pay the interest on and redemption price of the Refunded Bonds from moneys on deposit in the Escrow Fund) will cease. The holders of the Refunded Bonds will be entitled to payment from SMUD solely from moneys or Federal Securities on deposit in the Escrow Fund, and the Refunded Bonds will no longer be outstanding under the Resolution.] [Notwithstanding the deposit to the Escrow Funds, the Refunded Bonds will remain outstanding, and SMUD will remain liable for the payment of the principal and redemption price of and interest on the Refunded Bonds, until the Refunded Bonds are actually redeemed in full on the Redemption Date.] The Federal Securities and moneys in the Escrow Funds will not secure the 2024 Series N Bonds and will not be available to pay the principal of or interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds.]

[A portion of the proceeds of the 2024 Series N Bonds, [together with other available funds], will be used to pay the interest on the Refunded Bonds due on [____] (the “Redemption Date”) and to redeem the Refunded Bonds on the Redemption Date at their respective redemption prices.]

The issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds and the refunding of the Refunded Bonds are components of the Plan of Finance, as further described below. The issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds is not contingent upon the implementation of the other components of the Plan of Finance, and SMUD is not obligated to implement any of the components of the Plan of Finance.

**Issuance of 2024 Series M Bonds**

Concurrently with the issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds, SMUD expects to issue approximately $[____]1 aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Series M Bonds. The proceeds of the 2024 Series M Bonds are expected to be used to finance and refinance certain improvements and additions to SMUD’s Electric System, including by paying the outstanding principal amount of SMUD’s commercial paper notes at maturity, [and pay certain costs associated with the issuance of the 2024 Series M Bonds].

* Preliminary, subject to change.

**THE 2024 SERIES N BONDS**

The 2024 Series N Bonds will mature in the years and amounts and bear interest at the rates set forth on the inside cover page hereof. Interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds will accrue from the date of delivery of the 2024 Series N Bonds, and will be payable on [November 15, 2024], and semiannually thereafter on each [May 15 and November 15] (each, an “Interest Payment Date”) to the owners thereof as of the first day of the month (whether or not such day is a Business Day) in which an Interest Payment Date occurs (each, a “Record Date”).

The 2024 Series N Bonds will be issued in fully registered form and, when issued, will be registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York (“DTC”). DTC will act as securities depository (the “Securities Depository”) for the 2024 Series N Bonds. Individual purchases of interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds will be made in book-entry form only, in the principal amount of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. Purchasers of such interests will not receive certificates representing their interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds. Principal and interest are payable directly to the Securities Depository by the Trustee. Upon receipt of payments of principal and interest, the Securities Depository will in turn remit such principal and interest to the Securities Depository’s Direct Participants (as such term is hereinafter defined) for subsequent disbursement to the purchasers of interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.”

For so long as the book-entry system is in effect with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds, DTC shall select the 2024 Series N Bonds to be redeemed in accordance with the procedures of DTC.

**Notice of Redemption.** Notice of redemption for the 2024 Series N Bonds will be given by publication at least once in financial newspapers or journals, selected by the Trustee, of general circulation in San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, each such publication to be not less than 20 nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption, if at any time the 2024 Series N Bonds are not in book entry form. Notice will also be mailed to the registered owners of any 2024 Series N Bonds designated for redemption, but failure to mail such notice or any defect therein with respect to any particular 2024 Series N Bond will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other 2024 Series N Bonds. For so long as the book-entry system is in effect with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds, the Trustee will mail notice of redemption solely to DTC or its nominee or its successor. Any failure of DTC or its successor, or of a direct or indirect DTC participant, to notify a beneficial owner of a 2024 Series N Bond of any redemption will not affect the sufficiency or validity of the redemption of any 2024 Series N Bond. See APPENDIX C – “BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM.” SMUD may instruct the Trustee to give conditional notice of optional redemption, which may be conditioned upon the receipt of moneys or any other event.

# SECURITY FOR THE BONDS

## General

The principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Bonds, together with other Parity Bonds, are payable exclusively from, and are secured by a pledge (effected in the manner and to the extent provided in the Resolution) of, the Net Revenues of the Electric System of SMUD.

Neither the credit nor the taxing power of SMUD is pledged to the payment of the Bonds and the general fund of SMUD is not liable for the payment thereof. The owners of the Bonds cannot compel the exercise of any taxing power of SMUD or the forfeiture of any of its property. The Bonds are not a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien or encumbrance upon any of SMUD’s property (including the Electric System) or upon any of its income, receipts or revenues except the Net Revenues of the Electric System to the extent of the pledge thereof contained in the Resolution.

## Consent to Amendments to the Resolution

The purchasers of the 2024 Series N Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series N Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution (the “Proposed Amendments”). Such amendments are described in **bold italic font** herein under “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Rates and Charges” and “– Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues” and in APPENDIX D – “SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION – Certain Definitions” and “– Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds.” The written consents to the Proposed Amendments of the holders and registered owners of at least 60% of the Bonds outstanding have been filed with SMUD or the Trustee, as required by the Resolution. However, while certain Bonds remain outstanding, SMUD must also obtain the written consents of certain bond insurers to implement the Proposed Amendments. SMUD expects to implement the Proposed Amendments when the written consents of such bond insurers are obtained or
<!-- Page 259 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

when the Bonds insured by such bond insurers are no longer outstanding. The final maturity date of the insured Bonds is July 1, 2024.

**Allocation of Revenues**

After making an allocation of Revenues to Maintenance and Operation Costs and to Energy Payments not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs, the Treasurer of SMUD is required (subject to the last paragraph of this section) to set aside, on an equal priority with sums set aside for all other Parity Bonds, Net Revenues as follows:

**First:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Interest Fund, in approximately equal monthly installments on or before the first day of each month, an amount equal to at least one-fifth (1/5) of the aggregate amount of interest becoming due on the Bonds on the next succeeding semiannual interest payment date, until an amount sufficient to meet said interest payment is accumulated.

**Second:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Redemption Fund, to be set aside in the Principal Account and Sinking Fund, respectively, in approximately equal monthly installments on or before the first day of each month, an amount equal to at least one-tenth (1/10) of the aggregate amount of principal becoming due on serial Bonds and the aggregate minimum sinking fund payments required to be made with respect to term Bonds during the next ensuing 12 months, until an amount sufficient to meet the principal and sinking fund requirements on all Bonds outstanding is accumulated in said accounts, respectively.

**Third:** To the Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund, such amounts as any supplemental resolution authorizing the issuance of a series of Bonds may require to build up and maintain said fund.

If interest on Bonds of a series or maturity is payable more frequently than semiannually, the Treasurer of SMUD shall set aside out of Net Revenues in the Interest Fund such amounts as may be required to pay interest on the Bonds of such series or maturity on each interest payment date at least one month prior to such interest payment date. Allocation to the Electric Revenue Bond Redemption Fund and Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund shall be made as set forth above.

All remaining Revenues, after making the foregoing allocations, will be available to SMUD for all lawful SMUD purposes.

From time to time, SMUD may deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund from such remaining Revenues such amounts as SMUD shall determine, provided that deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund from remaining Revenues in any fiscal year may be made until (but not after) the date 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. SMUD may withdraw amounts from the Rate Stabilization Fund only for inclusion in Revenues for any fiscal year, such withdrawals to be made until (but not after) 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. All interest or other earnings upon deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be withdrawn therefrom and accounted for as Revenues. No deposit of Revenues to the Rate Stabilization Fund may be made to the extent such Revenues were included in any certificate submitted in connection with the issuance of additional bonds and withdrawal of the Revenues from the Revenues employed in rendering said certificate would have caused noncompliance with the additional bond provisions or to the extent withdrawals of the Revenues for any fiscal year would have reduced the debt provisions.

service ratio for such fiscal year to or below 1.40:1.00. See APPENDIX A – “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” for a description of the balance in the Rate Stabilization Fund.

With respect to Bonds of a series issued on or after October 1, 2003 (including the 2024 Series N Bonds), notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the Bonds of such series or maturity are outstanding, the supplemental resolution authorizing the issuance of such series shall require the Treasurer, out of Net Revenues received by SMUD, to set aside in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, such amounts as may be required so that an amount equal to the amount of principal and/or interest becoming due and payable on the Bonds of such series or maturity on each interest payment date and principal payment date is on deposit in the Interest Fund and the Principal Account, respectively, at such time on or prior to such interest payment date or principal payment date as shall be specified in the supplemental resolution authorizing such Bonds.

### Rates and Charges

SMUD has covenanted in the Resolution to establish and at all times maintain and collect rates and charges for the sale or use of electric energy generated, transmitted, distributed or furnished by SMUD which, together with certain items of other income permitted under the Resolution, will yield Revenues at least sufficient, with respect to the ensuing 12 months, to pay and provide for all sums required for Maintenance and Operation Costs and Energy Payments not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs and, in addition, to provide an aggregate sum equal to at least 1.20 times the total amount required for the payment of principal and interest, together with any sinking fund or reserve fund payments, on the Bonds and all Parity Bonds, in each case during such 12 months.

For purposes of the calculations of payments to be made pursuant to the Resolution, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, if a Financial Products Agreement has been entered into by SMUD with respect to any Parity Bonds, interest on such Parity Bonds shall be included in the calculation of such principal and interest by including for each fiscal year or period an amount equal to the amount of interest payable on such Parity Bonds in such fiscal year or period at the rate or rates stated in such Parity Bonds plus any Financial Product Payments payable in such fiscal year or period minus any Financial Product Receipts receivable in such fiscal year or period; provided that in no event shall any calculation made pursuant to this clause result in a number less than zero being included in the calculation of such principal and interest.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, Excluded Principal Payments shall be disregarded (but interest on the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payments relate shall be included until but not after the stated due date when principal payments on such Parity Bonds are scheduled by their terms to commence) and Assumed Principal Payments and Assumed Interest Payments shall be included; and for purposes of the above calculations of interest on Parity Bonds, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

![SMUD Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Document)

SMUD has full power to establish rates and charges for all SMUD services, and the levels of such rates are not subject to review or regulation by any other governmental agency, either federal or state.

For purposes of the calculations specified in this section: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments” for a description of the current Subsidy that SMUD receives with respect to the Refunded Bonds.

**Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues**

The Resolution provides that SMUD will not, so long as any Bonds are outstanding, issue any obligations payable in whole or in part from Revenues except the following:

1. Refunding bonds issued solely to refund all or part of the Bonds or Parity Bonds;

2. General obligation bonds or other securities secured by the full faith and credit of SMUD;

3. Additional revenue bonds (including additional Bonds under the Resolution and additional Parity Bonds), payable on a parity with the Bonds, with an equal lien and charge upon the Revenues, but only subject to the following conditions:

   (a) Such additional revenue bonds shall have been authorized for and the proceeds therefrom required to be applied to additions, betterments, extensions or improvements to the Electric System (and necessary costs of issuance, interest during construction and reserve funds);

   (b) The proceedings for the issuance of such additional revenue bonds shall require SMUD to fix and collect rates and charges in an amount not less, with respect to such bonds, than the amounts required with respect to Bonds issued under the Resolution;

   (c) SMUD shall not then be in default under the Resolution or other resolutions authorizing the issuance of Parity Bonds; and

   (d) The Trustee shall receive a certificate of SMUD to the effect (i) that Net Revenues, after completion of the improvements proposed to be financed by such additional revenue bonds, will be sufficient to pay the principal of and interest (and bond reserve fund requirements) on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding and on such additional revenue bonds; and (ii) that for a period of 12 consecutive months during the 24 months immediately preceding the issuance of the additional revenue bonds the Net Revenues have been at least equal to 1.25 times maximum annual debt service on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding and on such additional revenue bonds (after adjusting Net Revenues to include 75 percent of the estimated additional Net Revenues to be derived from an increase in rates and charges or from the acquisition of an existing revenue producing electric system); and

11
<!-- Page 262 -->
4. Revenue bonds junior and subordinate to the Bonds and Parity Bonds.

For purposes of the above calculations, Excluded Principal Payments shall be disregarded (but interest on the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payments relate shall be included until but not after the stated due date when principal payments on such Parity Bonds are scheduled by their terms to commence) and Assumed Principal Payments and Assumed Interest Payments shall be included; and for purposes of the above calculations of interest on Parity Bonds, the interest rates on Parity Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Parity Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period or periods of time, such rate or rates of interest for such period or periods and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period not covered by such known period or periods, the Assumed Interest Rate.

For purposes of the above calculations of principal and interest on Parity Bonds, if a Financial Products Agreement has been entered into by SMUD with respect to any Parity Bonds, interest on such Parity Bonds shall be included in the calculation of such principal and interest by including for each fiscal year or period an amount equal to the amount of interest payable on such Parity Bonds in such fiscal year or period at the rate or rates stated in such Parity Bonds plus any Financial Product Payments payable in such fiscal year or period minus any Financial Product Receipts receivable in such fiscal year or period; provided that in no event shall any calculation made pursuant to this clause result in a number less than zero being included in the calculation of such principal and interest.

For purposes of the calculations specified in this section: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Net Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Estimated Capital Requirements” for a description of SMUD’s projected capital requirements. Such capital requirements may be satisfied through the issuance of additional Bonds or Parity Bonds.

**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

SMUD’s audited, consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are included in APPENDIX B attached to this Official Statement. These financial statements have been audited by Baker Tilly US, LLP, Madison, Wisconsin (the “Auditor”), for the periods indicated and to the extent set forth in their report thereon and should be read in their entirety. SMUD has not requested nor did it obtain permission from the Auditor to include the audited, consolidated financial statements as an appendix to this Official Statement. Accordingly, the Auditor has not performed any procedures to review the financial condition or operations of SMUD subsequent to the date of its report included therein, nor has it reviewed any information contained in this Official Statement.

**TAX MATTERS**

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to SMUD (“Bond Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain covenants, interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Bond Counsel is of the further opinion that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel observes that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series N Bonds. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in APPENDIX E hereto.

To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at maturity of such 2024 Series N Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the term of such 2024 Series N Bonds), the difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of which, to the extent properly allocable to each Beneficial Owner thereof, is treated as interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and exempt from State of California personal income taxes. For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is the first price at which a substantial amount of such maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is sold to the public (excluding bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds accrues daily over the term to maturity of such 2024 Series N Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original issue discount is added to the adjusted basis of such 2024 Series N Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon trade or business disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment at maturity) of such 2024 Series N Bonds. Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of 2024 Series N Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of Beneficial Owners who do not purchase such 2024 Series N Bonds in the original offering to the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such 2024 Series N Bonds is sold to the public.

2024 Series N Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than their principal amount payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier call date) (“Premium Bonds”) will be treated as having amortizable bond premium. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond premium in the case of bonds, like the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is

15
<!-- Page 266 -->
![Document Page](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Page)

excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. However, the amount of tax-exempt interest received, and a Beneficial Owner’s basis in a Premium Bond, will be reduced by the amount of amortizable bond premium properly allocable to such Beneficial Owner. Beneficial Owners of Premium Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in their particular circumstances.

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the 2024 Series N Bonds. SMUD has made certain representations and covenanted to comply with certain restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds. The opinion of Bond Counsel assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken), or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the 2024 Series N Bonds. Accordingly, the opinion of Bond Counsel is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters.

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of amounts treated as interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds may otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. The nature of the interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds depends upon the status of the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial Owner’s other items of income or deduction. Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such other tax consequences.

Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court decisions may cause interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent Beneficial Owners from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals or clarification of the Code or court decisions may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the 2024 Series N Bonds. Prospective purchasers of the 2024 Series N Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment of the 2024 Series N Bonds for federal income tax purposes. It is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Furthermore, Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of SMUD, or about the effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. SMUD has covenanted, however, to comply with the requirements of the Code.

Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds ends with the issuance of the 2024 Series N Bonds, and, unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend SMUD or the Beneficial Owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the 2024 Series N Bonds in the event of an audit examination by the IRS. Under current procedures, Beneficial Owners would have little, if any, right to participate in the audit examination process. Moreover, because achieving judicial review in

**CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING**

Pursuant to the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, SMUD will covenant for the benefit of the holders and the “Beneficial Owners” (as defined in the Continuing Disclosure Agreement) of the 2024 Series N Bonds to provide certain financial information and operating data relating to SMUD by not later than 180 days after the end of each of SMUD’s fiscal years (presently, each December 31), commencing with the report for the year ending December 31, 2024 (the “Annual Report”), and to provide notices of the occurrence of certain listed events with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds. The Annual Report will be filed by or on behalf of SMUD with the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (the “MSRB”) through its Electronic Municipal Market Access system (“EMMA”) and any notices of such listed events will be filed by or on behalf of SMUD with the MSRB through EMMA. The specific nature of the information to be contained in the Annual Report and the notices of listed events are set forth in the form of the Continuing Disclosure Agreement which is included in its entirety in APPENDIX F hereto. SMUD’s covenant will be made in order to assist the Underwriters in complying with Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12.

[UPDATE/CONFIRM] [In a limited number of circumstances, certain of the annual reports, audited financial statements or listed event filings required to be made by SMUD during the last five years under its continuing disclosure undertakings were not connected to all of the CUSIP numbers of the bonds subject to the continuing disclosure undertakings. In addition, SMUD entered into two subordinated forward starting interest rate swaps in December 2019 and filed a notice of the interest rate swaps with the MSRB through EMMA in April 2020. A notice of rating upgrade on October 6, 2020, by Moody’s Investors Service of the Northern California Gas Authority No. 1 Gas Project Revenue Bonds, Series 2007B, was also not filed until October 28, 2020.]

# RATINGS

Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”) and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) have assigned ratings of “[AA (stable outlook)]” and “[Aa2 (stable outlook)],” respectively, to the 2024 Series N Bonds. Such ratings reflect only the views of such organizations and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold the 2024 Series N Bonds. Explanations of the significance of such ratings may be obtained only from the respective rating agencies. SMUD has furnished to Fitch and S&P certain information and materials concerning the 2024 Series N Bonds and itself. Generally, a rating agency bases its rating on the information and materials furnished to it and on investigations, studies and assumptions of its own. There is no assurance that such ratings will continue for any given period or that they will not be revised downward, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the respective rating agencies, if in the judgment of such rating agency, circumstances so warrant. SMUD has not, other than as described under “CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING” above, and the Underwriters have not undertaken any responsibility either to bring to the attention of the holders or beneficial owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds any proposed revision, suspension or withdrawal of any rating on the 2024 Series N Bonds or to oppose any such proposed revision, suspension or withdrawal. Any such downward revision, suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the 2024 Series N Bonds.

# INTRODUCTION

## General

The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) owns and operates an electric system that has provided retail electric service since 1946. SMUD’s current service area is approximately 900 square miles, and includes the principal parts of Sacramento County and small portions of Placer and Yolo counties. See “THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM – The Service Area.”

## Independent Governance

SMUD is an independently run community-owned organization. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government.

SMUD is governed by a Board of Directors (the “Board”), which consists of seven directors elected by ward for staggered four-year terms. The Board determines policy and appoints the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, who is responsible for SMUD’s overall management and day-to-day operations. The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager is responsible for the hiring and removal of all employees, other than the Chief Legal and Government Affairs Officer and General Counsel, the Internal Auditor and the Special Assistant to the Board, who are hired and may be removed only by the Board. The employment status of nearly all SMUD employees is governed by a civil service system administered by the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager.

The Board elects its President and Vice President annually to take office in January. The current members of the Board are as follows:

| Name                     | Occupation                                               | Ward  | Term Expires     |

**THE SERVICE AREA AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM**

**The Service Area**

SMUD is the primary distributor of electric power within an area of approximately 900 square miles in central California. The service area includes the State Capital, Sacramento, the populous areas principally to the northeast and south of the City of Sacramento (the “City” or “Sacramento”) and the agricultural areas to the north and south. The City is located 85 miles northeast of San Francisco.

SMUD’s electric system supplies power to a population of approximately 1.5 million with a total annual retail load of approximately 10,104 million kilowatt-hours (“kWh”) for the year ended December 31, 2023. As the capital of the nation’s most populous state, Sacramento benefits from the historically stabilizing influence of a large government sector. Sacramento is home to the State government headquarters, the Sacramento County seat, the City government and various special districts that combine to make government the largest single employment sector in the Sacramento area. Information technology, transportation, education and health services, leisure and hospitality, and construction round out the other major sectors of employment and industry in the area.

SMUD’s annual peak load has averaged 3,045 Megawatts (“MW”) over the last three years, with SMUD’s record peak load of 3,299 MW occurring on July 24, 2006. In 2022, SMUD recorded its second highest peak load of 3,263 MW. SMUD reviews its load forecast, at a minimum, on an annual basis.

**The Electric System**

SMUD owns and operates an integrated electric system that includes generation, transmission and distribution facilities.

SMUD supplies power to its bulk power substations through a 230 kilovolt (“kV”) and 115 kV transmission system. This system transmits power from SMUD’s generation plants and interconnects with Pacific Gas & Electric (“PG&E”) and the Western Area Power Administration (“WAPA”). Power is distributed throughout Sacramento County via a 69 kV sub-transmission system with the exception of the City’s downtown area, which is served from the 115 kV transmission system. The downtown area is served from 115/12 kV and 115/21 kV substations. The distribution system serving the remainder of SMUD’s service territory is comprised of 69/12 kV substations with overhead and underground 12 kV distribution circuits.

**BUSINESS STRATEGY**

**General**

SMUD’s Board of Directors has established the following purpose and vision statements: “SMUD’s purpose is to enhance the quality of life for our customers and community by providing reliable and affordable electricity, and leading the transition to a clean energy future. SMUD’s vision is to be a trusted and powerful partner in achieving an inclusive, zero carbon economy. SMUD will leverage its relationships to accelerate innovation, ensure energy affordability and reliability, protect the environment, eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, catalyze economic and workforce development, promote environmental justice, and enhance community vitality for all.” The Board has adopted a set of Strategic Directions with related metrics, which it considers essential for the success of SMUD and for serving SMUD’s customers. These include competitive rates, access to credit markets, reliability, customer relations, environmental leadership, resource planning, enterprise risk management and safety. Some of the general elements in SMUD’s business strategy are:

- developing and maintaining a sustainable and reliable power supply to meet demand growth consistent with State mandates and the Board’s directions for renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions to zero by 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”;
- working closely with customers to provide the information, tools and incentives to assist them to more efficiently manage energy use, which will contribute to meeting greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emission targets and managing needle peak demand requirements (those 40 or so hours of the year with extreme temperatures when customer demand surges by up to 400 additional MW);
- managing price, volumetric and credit risks associated with energy and natural gas procurement;
- attracting, developing and retaining a diverse, skilled and engaged workforce that reflects SMUD’s values and is committed to achieving SMUD’s mission;
- retaining local decision making authority and operational independence; and
- collaborating regionally to attract new businesses and grow existing business to diversify and strengthen the Sacramento economy.

SMUD’s long-range business strategy focuses in part on ensuring financial stability by establishing rates that provide an acceptable fixed charge coverage ratio on a consolidated basis, taking into consideration the impact of capital expenditures and other factors on cash flow.

with current energy market prices. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges.”

**Renewable Options.** SMUD’s customers have been increasingly interested in distributed energy resources, mainly through the installation of solar systems. As of December 2023, approximately 51,374 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, approximately 8% of retail customers, had installed solar systems, representing approximately 360 MW of solar installations.

As the cost of energy storage continues to decline, SMUD anticipates an increase in behind-the-meter energy storage, mainly through the installation of battery storage systems. As of December 2023, approximately 1,532 of SMUD’s residential and commercial customers, had installed storage systems, representing approximately 10 MW of storage.

As another option for solar, SMUD’s SolarShares® pilot program (the “SolarShares Pilot”) was established as a cost-effective and convenient way for commercial customers to meet their energy needs from solar power. The SolarShares Pilot offered SMUD commercial customers the opportunity to receive solar power without upfront costs or equipment installation through 5-, 10- or 20-year purchase contracts. Customers that entered into purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot receive up to half of their power from a utility-scale solar system. SMUD supplies solar power for the SolarShares Pilot either by building and maintaining utility-scale solar systems or by procuring solar power from third parties through power purchase agreements. The SolarShares Pilot generation was approximately 3.2% of retail sales in 2023. As of April 30, 2021, SMUD had completed the SolarShares Pilot and is not entering into new purchase contracts under the SolarShares Pilot.

Since January 2020, the California Building Code has required all new constructed residential buildings under three stories to be powered by photovoltaic solar systems. A new home satisfies this requirement if it installs on-site solar or participates in an approved community solar or energy storage program. In February 2020, SMUD obtained approval from the California Energy Commission (“CEC”) to administer its own community solar program, called Neighborhood SolarShares® (“Neighborhood SolarShares”). SMUD’s Neighborhood SolarShares program can be used by developers of new low-rise residential buildings to satisfy the mandatory solar requirement. See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Rooftop Solar Mandate.” Starting in 2023, the California Building Code’s mandatory solar requirement extends beyond low-rise residential properties, and other changes to the California Building Code’s community solar regulations took effect. SMUD revised its program to align with the new regulations and, in May 2023, obtained approval from the CEC to continue offering its Neighborhood SolarShares compliance option to newly constructed low rise residential homes in its service territory.

In addition to the SolarShares Pilot and Neighborhood SolarShares, SMUD maintains a voluntary green energy pricing program called Greenery® (“Greenery”). The Greenery program allows customers the opportunity to pay an additional amount per month to ensure that either all or part of their electricity comes from green or carbon free energy sources. In 2023, the program allocated Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”) equivalent to approximately 4.2% of retail sales to its participating customers.

**Energy Efficiency.** To further assist customers in managing energy use and reducing regional carbon emissions and air pollution, SMUD offers an extensive array of energy efficiency and building electrification programs and services including financial incentives, loans, energy audits and education. In addition, SMUD has partnered with local developers to incorporate energy efficiency and all-electric construction measures into new residential and commercial construction, which helps developers plan and design efficient, cost-effective and low or zero-emission buildings. As part of SMUD’s 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), SMUD set a goal for regional carbon emissions through transport and building

# Electrification and Sustainable Power Supply

Electrification aims to reduce carbon emissions in buildings and transport by 64% over the next 20 years. SMUD’s focus on electrification is continued in the Zero Carbon Plan (defined and discussed below). SMUD was the first electric utility in the country to set its efficiency goals based on carbon reductions, allowing building electrification and energy efficiency to both count toward meeting SMUD’s efficiency goals. This is a significant opportunity, as converting a typical home today to all-electric saves more than three times the carbon emissions compared to doing a major energy efficiency upgrade alone to the same building. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources.”

Maintaining a sustainable power supply entails focusing efforts on researching, promoting and implementing new renewable energy technologies and sources to meet SMUD’s long-term commitment to reducing carbon emissions and providing a reliable energy supply. SMUD defines a sustainable power supply as one that reduces SMUD’s GHG emissions to serve retail customer load to zero by 2030. See “– 2030 Zero Carbon Plan”. SMUD is planning to achieve zero GHG emissions to serve retail customer load through investments in energy efficiency, clean distributed energy resources, renewables portfolio standard (“RPS”) eligible renewables, energy storage, large hydroelectric generation, clean and emissions free fuels, carbon capture and sequestration, and new technologies and business models. Additionally, SMUD plans to continue pursuing GHG emissions reductions through vehicle, building and equipment electrification. At the same time, SMUD’s plans for maintaining a sustainable power supply include assuring the reliability of SMUD’s electric system, minimizing environmental impacts on land, habitat, water and air quality, and maintaining competitive rates relative to other electric providers in the State.

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills regulate GHG emissions and promote the development of sustainable generation alternatives, principally through more stringent RPS. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings” herein.

### 2030 Zero Carbon Plan

In July 2020, the Board declared a climate emergency and adopted a resolution calling for SMUD to take significant and consequential actions to reduce its carbon footprint by 2030. On April 28, 2021, the Board approved SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan (the “Zero Carbon Plan”). The Zero Carbon Plan is intended to be a flexible roadmap for SMUD to eliminate carbon emissions from its electricity production by 2030 while maintaining reliable and affordable service. To achieve these goals the Zero Carbon Plan is focused on four main areas: natural gas generation repurposing, proven technologies, new technologies and business models and financial impacts and options. SMUD plans to revisit the Zero Carbon Plan annually.

The natural gas generation repurposing focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for exploring the replacement of two of SMUD’s five Local Gas-Fired Plants (as defined herein) and the retooling of the other three Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” Based on SMUD’s studies to date, SMUD estimates that McClellan (as defined herein) and the Campbell Soup Project (as defined herein) can be replaced in the next several years depending on SMUD’s success with replacement resources. Final decisions about the replacement of these two Local Gas-Fired Plants will be based on additional reliability studies and engagement with the community. As part of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is also exploring converting the Carson Project (as defined herein) and the Procter & Gamble Project (as defined herein) to reliability use operations only and investigating the use of alternative fuels like Renewable Natural Gas-biomethane (RNG-biomanthene), hydrogen and other biofuels for the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, and the Consumers Power Plant (as defined herein). In addition, SMUD is investigating new technologies such as long duration energy storage, carbon capture and sequestration, hydrogen and other clean fuel alternatives to help support.

the reduction of GHG emissions in SMUD’s energy supply. All final generator configurations are subject to reliability assessments.

The proven clean technologies focus of the Zero Carbon Plan calls for SMUD to procure approximately 1,100 to 1,500 MW of utility-scale solar photovoltaic (“PV”) generating capacity, 700 to 1,100 MW of local utility-scale battery storage, 300 to 500 MW of wind generating capacity, and 100 to 220 MW of geothermal generating capacity. The Zero Carbon Plan also estimates that customer installation of approximately 500 to 750 MW of behind-the-meter solar PV generating capacity and approximately 50 to 250 MW of behind-the-meter battery storage will assist SMUD with achieving the Zero Carbon Plan goals.

With respect to new technologies and business models, the Zero Carbon Plan focuses on evaluating, prioritizing and scaling the emerging technologies that SMUD expects will have the largest impact on reducing carbon in SMUD’s 2030 resource mix. SMUD is currently focused on various areas of technology and customer-focused programs, including electrification, demand flexibility, virtual power plants, vehicle-to-grid technology, and new grid-scale technologies. The Zero Carbon Plan forecasts that customer-owned devices and SMUD customer-focused programs will contribute between 360 and 1,300 MW of capacity to SMUD’s grid by 2030.

The financial impacts and options focus of the Zero Carbon Plan aims to keep SMUD rate increases at or below the rate of inflation while achieving SMUD’s goal of eliminating carbon emissions from its power supply by 2030. To pay for the expected costs of the Zero Carbon Plan and keep rate increases at or below the rate of inflation, the Zero Carbon Plan estimates the need for SMUD to realize between $50 million and $150 million of sustained annual savings. SMUD currently plans to achieve these sustained annual savings by exploring the implementation of operational savings and pursuing partnership and grant opportunities.

While the ultimate impacts of the Zero Carbon Plan on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy from clean technologies, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers, such impacts could be material.

Renewable Energy and Climate Change. The California Renewable Energy Resources Act, established by Senate Bill X1-2 (“SBX1-2”) and the Clean Energy and Pollution Reduction Act of 2015, enacted by Senate Bill 350 (“SB 350”) require that SMUD meets 33% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2020 and 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources by 2030. Senate Bill 100 (“SB 100”), passed by the legislature and approved by then-Governor Brown on September 10, 2018, accelerates the RPS targets and establishes a new 60% target by 2030. The bill also created a planning goal to meet all of the State’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Renewables Portfolio Standards” for a discussion of the State RPS requirements.

SMUD’s compliance with State RPS requirements is evaluated over 3- or 4-year compliance periods. SMUD met the State RPS requirements for the first compliance period (2011-2013) and second compliance period (2014-2016). The third compliance period (2017-2020) required SMUD to source one-third of its energy from renewable resources, and SMUD had sufficient RECs to meet the third compliance period requirements. SMUD filed its 2020 and third compliance period RPS compliance report with the CEC in the second quarter of 2021 and the CEC adopted SMUD’s third compliance period verification report in December 2023. SMUD expects the confirmation letter from the CEC indicating that SMUD was A-9
<!-- Page 283 -->
![SMUD's RPS Goals](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD's+RPS+Goals+(Existing+%26+Committed+Resources%3B+RPS+Target%3A+60%25+by+2030))

in full compliance with its third compliance period RPS obligations in the first quarter of 2024. As of the end of the third compliance period (2020), SMUD had approximately one million surplus RECs available to help meet future RPS targets. SMUD expects to file its 2023 RPS compliance report by July 1, 2024, showing that SMUD will have provided approximately 50% of its retail sales from RPS-eligible renewable resources in 2023, which is greater than the interim 2023 RPS target of 41.25%. RPS compliance is determined by compliance period and not by individual years and SMUD anticipates having sufficient surplus procured and/or under contract resources in the fourth compliance period (2021-2024) to be in compliance with the RPS requirements. In addition to meeting RPS standards, SMUD serves an additional 7.4% of its customer load with renewable energy through its voluntary SolarShares and Greenergy pricing programs described above. SMUD estimates that it has sufficient renewable energy deliveries, new power supply contract commitments, new power supply commitments under active discussion, and RPS-eligible surplus carryover to meet its RPS requirements through 2025. Additional resources have been identified that are expected to provide sufficient RPS-eligible resources to cover most of SMUD’s RPS requirements through 2030. Future solicitations may be needed to fill any remaining gaps. The following chart illustrates SMUD’s current RPS requirements through 2030 and its existing and committed resources utilized to meet those requirements.

In addition to procuring new sources, meeting the RPS requirements will require replacement of certain existing renewable contracts which expire in future years. While SMUD anticipates it will meet much of its renewable resource requirements through purchased contracts with third parties, it continues to explore additional options, including wind, solar, biomass, and geothermal developments, partnering with other utilities on future projects, and local development options. SMUD’s resource forecast (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Projected Resources”) accounts for future renewable resources as a component of “Uncommitted Purchases.” To meet SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan goals, SMUD anticipates meeting loads in 2030 with approximately 70-80% renewable resources, in addition to hydro and other new zero carbon technologies. See “← 2030 Zero Carbon Plan” above.

Given the intermittent nature of power from renewable resources such as wind and solar, SMUD is exploring and investing in options that provide the flexibility to manage the intermittency of such renewable resources. Potential options include energy storage resources, which SMUD has committed to as part of the Zero Carbon Plan, and expanding load management resources. Additionally, on April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its membership in BANC, a joint exercise of powers agency formed in 2009, and currently comprised of SMUD, the Modesto Irrigation District (“MID”), the City of Roseville (“Roseville”), the City of Redding (“Redding”), the City of Shasta Lake and the Trinity Public Utilities District, commenced participation in the California Independent System Operator Corporation (“CAISO”) western energy imbalance market (“WEIM”). Participation in the WEIM benefits SMUD by providing it with broader access to balancing resources within the region to help manage its expanding renewable portfolio. In addition, other entities within the BANC Balancing Authority Area began participation in the WEIM on March 25, 2021. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Operational Independence and Local Control” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

In 2022, SMUD’s Board formally adopted the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan as SMUD’s updated IRP. SMUD filed the approved IRP update with the CEC on September 14, 2022, pursuant to the CEC’s guidelines, which called for updating SMUD’s IRP filing within five years of SMUD’s previous filing of April 29, 2019. SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan built upon the April 2019 IRP and set a goal for zero carbon emissions by 2030. SMUD’s next formal IRP process is expected to be completed and filed with the CEC in 2027. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

The State’s carbon cap-and-trade market established pursuant to Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”) began in 2013. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Greenhouse Gas Emissions” for a discussion of AB 32 and the State’s cap-and-trade program. SMUD anticipates that allowances allocated to SMUD will nearly equal SMUD’s compliance obligations under normal water year conditions. Under low water year conditions, SMUD may need to purchase additional allowances to cover its compliance obligations, including carbon obligations related to wholesale energy sales from SMUD’s natural gas power plants. As SMUD implements its clean power goals, SMUD expects its need for these allowances to decline.

There is scientific consensus that increasing concentrations of GHG have caused and will continue to cause a rise in temperatures in the State and around the world. The change in the earth’s average atmospheric temperature, generally referred to as “climate change,” is, among other things, expected to result in a wide range of changes in climate patterns, including increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including droughts and heat waves, more frequent incidences of wildfires, changes in wind patterns, sea level rise and flooding, any of which alone or in combination could materially adversely affect SMUD’s financial results or operations. See also “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION” and “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY – Other Factors.” As described above, SMUD is actively working to meet its sustainable power supply goals.

reduce its own GHG emissions, and assist the local governments in the territory it serves with their desired GHG reductions. In 2016, SMUD introduced the Pilot Natural Refrigerant Incentive Program, its first customer program providing incentives for GHG reduction in addition to kWh savings. SMUD is a founding member and active participant in the Capital Region Climate Readiness Collaborative, a public-private partnership formed to better understand and plan for climate impacts expected in the region. SMUD is also an active member of the United States Department of Energy (the “DOE”) Partnership for Energy Sector Climate Resilience. SMUD regularly reviews scientific findings related to climate change and in 2016 published its Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan. In 2024, SMUD is planning to update the Climate Readiness Assessment and Action Plan along with other climate resiliency actions.

**Energy Storage Systems.** Assembly Bill 2514 (“AB 2514”) requires the Board to re-evaluate energy storage goals every three years. In compliance with AB 2514, the Board established a target of 9 MW of energy storage procurement by December 31, 2020, which SMUD has procured. See “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Energy Storage Systems” for further discussion of AB 2514. In September 2020, the Board directed that energy storage forecasts be implemented through SMUD’s IRP process going forward. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” above for a discussion of SMUD’s IRP. SMUD is also evaluating how to couple utility-scale solar with utility-scale storage to support future system reliability needs and enable energy goals.

**Meeting Peak Load.** A significant consideration for SMUD will be how it addresses its system peak load. SMUD has implemented programs and tools, such as advanced metering, energy efficiency options, and TOD rates for residential customers, to help customers manage their costs while helping SMUD reduce its peak load. Analysis of 2022 data showed a reduction of approximately 108 MW, weather continue to monitor the progress and results of the implementation of TOD rates and will use this information to inform future rate actions and load forecasts. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Serving SMUD’s Customers – Time-of-Day Rates.”

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved an optional residential Critical Peak Pricing rate (the “Peak Pricing Rate”), which went into effect June 1, 2022. The Peak Pricing Rate is designed to reduce load by increasing the price of energy when the grid is most impacted, up to 50 hours per summer. In exchange, customers on the rate will receive a per kWh discount on summer Off-Peak and Mid-Peak rates. SMUD is also exploring the use of more distributed energy resources and demand response programs that could further reduce SMUD’s system peak.

**Operational Independence and Local Control.** A key component of SMUD’s business strategy is focused on maintaining its independence in operating and maintaining its resources. As such, SMUD has taken a number of actions to mitigate the potential impacts of various federal and state regulatory actions. For example, in 2002 SMUD established itself as an independent control area (now termed “Balancing Authority”) within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (“WECC”) region. By removing itself from CAISO’s Balancing Authority area, SMUD became responsible for balancing electric supply and demand within its own service territory. This move substantially reduced fees paid to CAISO, preserved operational flexibility and helped to insulate SMUD from the uncertain regulatory environment and tariff structure of CAISO. In addition to decreased financial risks, this independence also reduced SMUD’s exposure to the impacts of capacity and energy shortages in the CAISO Balancing Authority area. Further, as an independent Balancing Authority, SMUD continued to support the statewide electric grid in events of electrical emergencies requiring rotating outages, such as loss of major transmission lines or equipment, as provided in the statewide emergency plan. By 2006, the SMUD Balancing Authority footprint expanded north to the California-Oregon border and south to Modesto, to include the service areas of the WAPA, MID, Redding and Roseville, and TANC-owned 340-mile 500-kV California-Oregon Transmission Project.

(“COTP”). In October 2009, SMUD, with the coordination and cooperation of WAPA, joined the Western Power Pool Reserve Sharing Group, which supports reliability and reduces operating costs. In May 2011, BANC assumed the role of the Balancing Authority, though SMUD continues to oversee operation of the grid on behalf of BANC. BANC members share cost responsibility for balancing authority-related compliance obligations, liabilities, and operations. BANC also serves as an important venue for SMUD and other BANC members to collaborate with respect to operational and market improvements inside the BANC footprint and to preserve their operational independence. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.” On April 3, 2019, SMUD, through its participation in BANC, began operating in the CAISO WEIM, which helps SMUD better manage the integration of renewable energy resources. The CAISO WEIM is a voluntary market, which allows SMUD to maintain its operational independence from the CAISO, while providing SMUD greater access to balancing resources throughout the western region. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Balancing Authority Area Agreements.”

Electricity, Natural Gas, and Related Hedging

SMUD continues to utilize a comprehensive and integrated power and fuel supply strategy to acquire a reliable and diversified portfolio of resources to meet existing and future needs. This strategy includes a combination of both physical supply and financial hedging transactions to reduce price risk exposure over a five-year horizon. SMUD’s physical supply arrangements include ownership of power generating resources, as well as a diversified portfolio of power and fuel supply purchase contracts that range in duration, with a mixture of fixed and variable pricing terms.

With regard to the power purchase contracts, SMUD has entered into a series of contracts for the purchase of electricity to meet its resource needs. SMUD also actively manages its exposure on variable rate electricity purchases, and at times may enter into financial contracts to fix prices by using options to reduce price risk, in each case when warranted by economic conditions. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements.”

With regard to fuel supply contracts, SMUD utilizes a similar strategy of employing financial contracts of various durations to hedge its variable rate fuel supply contracts. As of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply – Supply.”

As provided in SMUD’s natural gas contracts, SMUD may be required to post collateral to various counterparties. As of February 29, 2024, SMUD did not have any collateral posting obligations. A decrease in natural gas prices could result in a collateral posting by SMUD. While the posting of collateral is not an expense for SMUD, it does temporarily encumber unrestricted cash balances.

To hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a pass-through rate component called the Hydro Generation Adjustment (the “IGA”), and established a Hydro Rate Stabilization Fund (the “HRSF”). Similarly, to hedge against hydroelectric production volatility of non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities, SMUD implemented a HGA and established a WAPA Rate Stabilization Fund (“WRSF”). These rate stabilization funds and rate pass through mechanisms help to offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs in years where precipitation levels at SMUD-owned and non-SMUD-owned hydroelectric facilities are low. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

A-13
<!-- Page 287 -->
![Managing Risks](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Managing+Risks)

**Managing Risks**  
SMUD maintains an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program, a strategic approach to managing enterprise-wide risks as a portfolio, to help reduce the chance of loss, create greater financial stability and protect SMUD resources. It is designed to maintain an early warning system to monitor changes in, and the emergence of, risks that affect the organization’s business objectives. Under the purview of the Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee, composed of executive members and chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, ERM conducts ongoing risk identification, assessments, monitoring, mitigation, risk-based budgeting and reporting. To ensure accountability and oversight, each identified risk is assigned to an executive-level risk owner. Risk status and mitigation efforts are reported monthly to the Board.

**Competitive Challenges**  
In the coming decade, utilities like SMUD may face competition from companies in other industries looking to diversify into the energy sector. Examples of developing competitive areas include retail sale of electricity, distributed electric storage resources, renewable distributed generation (mostly solar in Sacramento), customer installation of fuel cells, third-party electric vehicle charging, home or business automation that enables greater customer participation in energy markets, and third-party provision of energy management software and solutions.

SMUD has a wide range of initiatives to monitor and adapt to changing market conditions and new industry participants. Key areas of focus include:

- **Enhancing customer experience.** Recognizing the importance of meeting customer expectations, SMUD introduced the Customer Experience Strategy in 2016 to provide customers “value for what they pay” and further strengthen customer loyalty. The initiative is focused on ensuring SMUD has the people, systems, technology, programs and services to consistently meet or exceed customers’ changing expectations. The customer experience is measured via surveys with the goal of achieving 80% of customers agreeing that SMUD provides them with value for what they pay by 2030.

- **Restructuring electric rates.** In 2017, the Board approved TOD rates as the standard rate for residential customers. The residential rate transition began in the fourth quarter of 2018, and the full transition was completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. All of SMUD’s business customers are also on time-based rates. In 2019, the Board approved a restructuring of commercial rates to collect a greater portion of fixed costs through fixed charges and to better align time periods and prices with energy markets. The transition was completed in the first quarter of 2022. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rates and Charges” and “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

- **Ongoing integrated resource planning.** SMUD monitors and updates its integrated resource planning to ensure future sources of energy balance cost, reliability and environmental requirements with the flexibility to meet challenges of changing market and regulatory conditions, customer energy resources, and emerging technologies.

**Leveraging Core Competencies**  
In addition to these initiatives, SMUD is leveraging core competencies to improve industry safety and help communities serve their customers’ energy needs.

![Sacramento Power Academy](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Sacramento Power Academy.** The Sacramento Power Academy is SMUD’s operational training center providing training support for all of SMUD’s skilled trades professionals. Operating on a 10-acre training facility the academy oversees SMUD’s 14 skilled trades apprenticeships. The academy’s experienced training professionals serve as liaisons and mentors to apprentices progressing through on-the-job training, program testing, night schooling, and extensive training components. The academy also ensures SMUD’s skilled trades professionals are safe and compliant by coordinating and delivering annual regulatory and safety training. The academy is also a workforce development hub utilized by SMUD to increase awareness of and interest in skilled trades careers at SMUD, in SMUD’s community, and in the utility industry.

**Community Energy Services.** In 2002, Assembly Bill 117 was passed to establish Community Choice Aggregation in the State by authorizing Community Choice Aggregators (“CCAs”) to aggregate customer electric load and purchase electricity for customers. SMUD’s Community Energy Services department was established in 2017 to support organizations with values closely aligned with SMUD’s values, while also generating additional revenue for SMUD. CCA programs are proliferating in the State thanks to support for expanding renewable energy use and desire for local control particularly for electricity procurement. There are numerous CCAs operating in the State, and more are anticipated to launch in the future. CCAs are responsible for procuring wholesale power, setting the generation rate, and staffing a call center to handle opt-outs and questions about the power portfolio. The local investor-owned utility (“IOU”) continues to deliver electricity from the electric grid, maintain its electric infrastructure, bill customers and collect payments.

In October 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Valley Clean Energy (“VCE”) to provide technical, energy and support services, including data management and call center services, wholesale energy services, and business operations support, to VCE for a term set to end in 2023. SMUD and VCE recently executed a new contract for data management, contact center, consulting and debt collection services that expires on December 31, 2028. VCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the City of Woodland, the City of Davis and Yolo County to implement a local CCA program. The service territory expanded to include the City of Winters in 2021. The mission of VCE is to deliver cost-competitive clean electricity, product choice, price stability, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reductions to its customers in Yolo County. VCE began electric services to its customers in the summer of 2018, giving Yolo County residents a choice between two electricity providers, VCE and PG&E.

In November 2017, SMUD was selected by the governing board of East Bay Community Energy (“EBCE”) to provide call center and data management services for a three-year term beginning in January 2018. SMUD signed a new contract with EBCE in January 2022 for call center and data management services for an additional three-year term. EBCE recently changed its name to Ava Community Energy (“Ava”). Ava is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro and Union City in Alameda County to implement a local CCA program. Ava expanded its territory to the cities of Pleasanton, Newark, and Tracy in April 2021.

In June 2019, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Silicon Valley Clean Energy (“SVCE”) to provide program services to help local SVCE communities reduce carbon pollution while delivering engaging customer experiences. SVCE programs are focused on grid integration, as well as electrifying transportation, buildings and homes. This contract was extended through September of 2024. In June 2023, SMUD was selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s concierge service vendor for three years. In December 2023, SMUD was again selected through a competitive process as SVCE’s programs administrator for five years. SVCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Campbell, Cupertino, Gilroy, Lost Altos, Los Altos Hills, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Monte Sereno, Morgan Hill,

Mountain View, Saratoga, Sunnyvale and Unincorporated Santa Clara County to implement a local CCA program.

In July 2022, SMUD was selected by the governing board of Marin Clean Energy (“MCE”) to provide data management, billing, data analytic and system assessment services to MCE. MCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2010 and represents 37 member communities across four Bay Area counties: Contra Costa, Marin, Napa and Solano.

In September 2022, SMUD was selected through a competitive process by the governing board of Sonoma Clean Power (“SCP”) to provide market research services to SCP. In January of 2023, SMUD was selected to provide strategic consulting services, providing recommendations related to programs and marketing. SCP is a joint powers agency that serves Sonoma and Mendocino counties.

While CCAs have had success in the State, they are susceptible to business, regulatory and other risks that could lead to a financial loss and/or result in a cessation of operations for the CCA. These risks could extend to a CCA’s counterparties, including SMUD. SMUD has made an effort to identify and mitigate potential counterparty risks to the extent possible in service agreements with the CCAs described above. SMUD may pursue opportunities to provide similar services to additional CCAs in the future. SMUD management does not expect its current arrangements to have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

## FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION

### Precipitation Variability

SMUD uses a precipitation measuring station located at Fresh Pond, California to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s Upper American River Project (the “UARP”) hydropower reservoir. As of January 31, 2024, precipitation at Fresh Pond, California totaled 21 inches for the October-September hydropower water supply period. This is 75% of the 50-year rolling median of 28 inches. Total reservoir storage in the UARP hydropower reservoirs was 238 thousand acre-feet as of January 31, 2024, which was about 63% of capacity and approximately 6% above the historical average. SMUD manages its reservoirs to maximize water storage going into the summer season, which preserves generating capacity during SMUD’s high load months and ensures that SMUD meets its UARP FERC license requirements, including requirements for recreational and environmental flows.

There can be wide swings in precipitation from year to year. In years with below average rainfall, SMUD may have to generate or purchase replacement energy at additional cost. To hedge against variations in the volume of energy received from SMUD-owned UARP hydroelectric resources, SMUD uses the HRSF to help offset increased power supply or fuel supply costs. See “RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE – Rate Stabilization Funds.”

SMUD is also exposed to precipitation variability through its contract with the WAPA. In an average water year this contract provides roughly 661 gigawatt hours (“GWh”) of power. WAPA’s actual deliveries are based on hydroelectric generation (minus energy used for pumping) at Central Valley Project reservoirs in Northern California, which varies based on annual precipitation patterns, water deliveries for agriculture, and flow requirements in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. Unlike the UARP, SMUD does not monitor precipitation stations to approximate power deliveries under the WAPA contract, and instead relies on a forecast of power deliveries from WAPA. As of January 31, 2024, WAPA has forecasted power deliveries of 703 GWh for 2024, approximately 6% more than an average water year. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Western Area Power Administration.”

# Wildfires

## General
Wildfires in the State have become increasingly common and destructive. Frequent drought conditions and unseasonably warm temperatures have increased, and could further increase, the possibility of wildfires occurring in areas where SMUD maintains generation, transmission and distribution facilities. The number of diseased and dead trees has increased, and could further increase this possibility. As a result, SMUD faces an increased risk that it may be required to pay for wildfire related property damage or

**Transmission (Outside of SMUD Service Territory).** In 2018, the CPUC approved a new statewide fire map that identifies areas of elevated and extreme wildfire risk from utility-associated assets located throughout the State. SMUD directly participated in the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map. In connection with the development of the CPUC’s statewide fire map, a peer review and a team of independent nationwide experts led by Cal Fire affirmed that SMUD’s electric service area is properly located outside of these elevated (“Tier 2”) and extreme (“Tier 3”) high fire threat areas; however, SMUD’s UARP facilities are located within both Tier 2 and Tier 3 areas. According to the CPUC, Tier 2 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an elevated wildfire risk from utility assets and Tier 3 fire-threat areas are areas where there is an extreme risk from utility assets. As of June 8, 2021, approximately 37 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 19 right-of-way miles of SMUD’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. SMUD is also a member of TANC. As of July 2022, approximately 116.3 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 2 fire-threat areas and approximately 4.5 right-of-way miles of TANC’s transmission lines are in Tier 3 fire-threat areas. In accordance with its FERC license, SMUD adheres to a FERC-approved Fire Prevention and Response Plan for its UARP facilities. On May 17, 2018, in accordance with State law, SMUD’s Board of Directors determined that the UARP area may have a “significant risk of catastrophic wildfire” resulting from overhead electric facilities and that SMUD’s FERC-approved UARP Fire Prevention and Response Plan meets requirements for presenting wildfire mitigation measures to the Board for its approval.

**Wildfire Mitigation.** In response to potential wildfire risk, SMUD has implemented and is continuing to implement a series of measures intended to prevent wildfires from occurring, minimize the spread of any fire that does occur and improve the resiliency of its system. These measures include an increase in the number of inspections of fuel reduction inside and adjacent to rights-of-ways, utilization of Cal Fire-approved operational material to reduce the risk of sparking; enhanced inspection and maintenance programs; increased use of ignition reduction techniques, including undergrounding of conductors; increased monitoring of identified responses to fire conditions, including operational procedures for the de-energization of lines during high fire conditions; and elimination of automatic reclosing on SMUD’s transmission lines and on SMUD’s distribution lines in certain areas during fire season.

SMUD’s proactive approach to vegetation management has been expanded to include the use of advanced technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (“LiDAR”), ortho and oblique imagery that is used to pinpoint tree health and/or condition that may not yet be visible to the naked eye. In addition, SMUD has installed additional weather stations in transmission corridors and substations for increased situational awareness and has continued coordination and collaboration with local agencies and first responders as well as vulnerable populations.

State legislation enacted in 2018 and 2019 (SB 901 and AB 1054, respectively) requires publicly owned utilities (“POUs”) to prepare and present Wildfire Mitigation Plans to their governing boards by January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter. SB 901 requires POUs, including SMUD, before January 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, to prepare a wildfire mitigation plan and present it in a public meeting to their governing board. SB 901 requires POU’s to accept comments on the wildfire mitigation plan from the public, other local and State agencies, and interested parties, and to verify that the plan complies with all applicable rules, regulations, and standards, as appropriate. The bill requires a qualified independent evaluator to review and assess the comprehensiveness of its wildfire mitigation plan and present its report to the board in a public meeting. AB 1054 created a new Wildfire Safety Division within the CPUC to prioritize wildfire safety throughout the State, and established an appointed Wildfire Safety Advisory Board (“WSAB”) to advise and make recommendations relating to wildfire safety to this new Division. For POUs, the bill requires submittal of annual wildfire mitigation plans to the WSAB for review and advisory opinions relating to the content and sufficiency of the plans.

SMUD assembled an enterprise-wide team of subject-matter experts to prepare its plan in compliance with this legislation. SMUD’s initial Wildfire Mitigation Plan (“WMP”) was adopted by the Board in the fourth quarter of 2019, after circulation for public comment and review of the comprehensiveness of the plan by a qualified independent evaluator. The WMP and evaluator’s report were submitted to the WSAB in 2020.

SMUD reviews its WMP each year, presenting the updated plan to the Board for adoption at duly noticed public meetings. The updated plans and evaluator reports are submitted to the WSAB for advisory opinion and recommendations. SMUD responds to the WSAB’s comments regarding SMUD’s WMP as part of its WMP process. SMUD will continue to annually review and update its WMP, conducting a comprehensive review at least every third year.

SMUD recently completed a comprehensive review and update of its WMP after soliciting public input and independent evaluation. The 2023-2025 WMP was adopted by the Board on June 15, 2023, and duly submitted to the WSAB.

### Wildfire Insurance
Wildfires both in California and nationally have not only increased potential liability for utilities, but have also adversely impacted the insurance markets, leading to higher costs for coverage; coverages becoming prohibitively expensive; limited or restricted coverage to certain types of risks; or coverage at insufficient levels. SMUD most recently renewed its general and wildfire liability insurance coverage on June 15, 2023, increasing the coverage limit by $25 million to $275 million. SMUD increased the commercially insured portion of its wildfire coverage program from $176 million to $212.5 million and maintained the self-insured layers and quota share portions of the coverage at $6.5 million.

In addition, it is expected that SMUD will have a portion of the $500 million aggregate limit amount of its commercial paper and line of credit program to provide operational flexibility in the event of the occurrence of a wildfire or other operational event. However, SMUD has not covenanted to maintain the availability of the commercial paper program and line of credit program for these purposes and no assurances can be given that the commercial paper and line of credit program will be available at the time of, or during, such an event.

### August 2020 Heat Wave
The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from August 14, 2020 through August 18, 2020. The CAISO was forced to institute rotating electricity outages in the State during this extreme heat wave. SMUD, as a member of BANC, and being outside of the CAISO did not have to implement any planned power disruptions. Additionally, SMUD was able to support the CAISO during some hours of the heat wave with both requested emergency assistance and wholesale market sales. SMUD’s peak demand between August 14, 2020 and August 18, 2020, varied between 2,874 MW and 3,057 MW, well below SMUD’s record peak of 3,299 MW.

### September 2022 Heat Wave
The State experienced a period of prolonged above average temperatures from September 5, 2022 through September 8, 2022. On September 6, 2022, SMUD experienced its second highest peak demand of 3,263 MW. SMUD did not have to implement any planned power disruptions.

### Storm Damage
In January 2023, SMUD experienced a series of winter storms that brought heavy rains and high winds causing damage to SMUD’s grid and widespread outages for SMUD’s customers. By the time the A-19
<!-- Page 293 -->

**storm response was complete, SMUD had experienced the largest mobilization of personnel and restoration crews in its history. SMUD incurred costs related to removing downed trees, restoring power from downed poles and broken lines, replenishing inventory, communicating with and providing assistance to customers, maintaining IT systems, and coordinating with local emergency agencies. SMUD is pursuing claims with Federal and State agencies to attempt to recover certain of SMUD’s costs related to the storms. The material financial impacts have been reflected in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, [which are included in APPENDIX B].**

**Cosumnes Power Plant Outage**

On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant (as defined herein) was shut down due to a ground fault in the Steam Turbine Generator (“STG”) stator. The ground fault was caused by delamination of the insulation on one of the through bolts. Damage from the ground fault resulted in a full rewind and restack of the stator core, replacement of all stator through bolts, and a full rewind of turbine rotor. The Cosumnes Power Plant repairs were completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. During the extended outage, SMUD shifted generation to the other local gas-fired plants and the Sutter Energy Center and procured additional energy and resource adequacy capacity. SMUD also requested and received approval from the California Air Quality Board and California Energy Commission to operate one or both of the gas turbines without the STG. During the September 2022 heatwave, both of the gas turbines at the Cosumnes Power Plant were operated without the STG, providing 270 MW at peak.

To mitigate the financial impact of unplanned outages from its thermal assets, SMUD carries commercial property insurance with a business interruption endorsement. At the time of the loss, the coverage provided up to $30.8 million of business interruption recovery per month at the Cosumnes Power Plant, with a sub-limit of $310 million over any 18-month period. During the period of loss, claims were subject to a $5 million equipment damage deductible and a 60-day business interruption claims waiting period.

SMUD has settled the equipment damage portion of the loss for $18.6 million, resulting in a $13.6 million recovery. The business interruption portion of the claim remains in process, with SMUD receiving a $50 million advance in December of 2022. As of January 2024, the carriers have confirmed an additional $51 million in undisputed recovery, which is anticipated to be received in the first quarter of 2024. Thus far, SMUD has recovered $114.6 million of the loss and will continue to work toward full settlement of the disputed portion of the claim, which is approximately $68 million.

**Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic**

While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD has lessened since the height of the pandemic in 2020, SMUD is still experiencing impacts from the pandemic. However, compared to weather adjusted load levels, SMUD’s overall load is near or above pre-pandemic levels.

Part of the governmental response to the economic consequences of the pandemic required utility providers (including SMUD) to provide additional grace periods and flexible payment plans for the payment of utility bills or to refrain from pursuing collection remedies for unpaid bills for a period of time. SMUD also implemented a no-shutoff policy through January 2022 under which SMUD did not disconnect power to a customer for non-payment of their electric bill. Beginning in February 2022, SMUD resumed its normal payment, late fee, and disconnection process and began disconnections of unpaid accounts in late April 2022. As a result, SMUD has experienced an increase in delinquencies for customer electric accounts versus pre-pandemic levels. In December 2021, SMUD received $41 million from the California Arrearage Payment Program (“CAPP”) initial funding, and an additional $9.9 million in 2022. All funds were applied to delinquent balances. As of December 31, 2023, the total delinquencies for customer electric

**A-20**
<!-- Page 294 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

accounts were $38.2 million, after the CAPP credit, which is an increase from the February 2020 balance of total delinquencies for customer electric accounts of $16.9 million. The financial impacts stemming from delinquent accounts have been accounted for in SMUD’s audited financial statements for the preceding years. Any successful recovery of delinquent accounts will contribute to an increase in net income.

SMUD also paused the recertification process for existing customers in SMUD’s low-income discount program during the pandemic. The number of customers participating in the low-income assistance program increased by 16,407, or approximately 22% from February 2020 to December 2023. SMUD has resumed the recertification process for existing customers in the low-income discount program in 2023.

While the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on SMUD have lessened, if the pandemic and its consequences again become more severe or another similar event occurs, the impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations could be material.

## RATES AND CUSTOMER BASE

### Rates and Charges

SMUD’s Board of Directors has autonomous authority to establish the rates charged for all SMUD services. Unlike IOUs and some other municipal utility systems, retail rate and revenue levels are not subject to review or regulation by any other federal, State or local governmental agencies. Changes to SMUD rates only require formal action by the Board of Directors after two public workshops and a public hearing. SMUD is not required by law to transfer any portion of its collections from customers to any local government. SMUD typically reviews and sets rates on a two-year cycle.

### 2019 Rate Action.

On June 24, 2019, the Board approved a 3.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2020, a 3.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2020, a 2.50% rate increase effective January 1, 2021, and a 2.00% rate increase effective October 1, 2021, for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved a restructuring of the commercial rates, including new time periods and an overall increase in the fixed bill components, such as the System Infrastructure Fixed Charge and demand charges, and a corresponding decrease in energy charges, making the restructuring revenue neutral by rate category. To minimize bill impacts, rate categories will be restructured over an eight-year period.

### 2021 Rate Action.

On September 16, 2021, the Board approved a 1.5% rate increase effective March 1, 2022 and a 2.0% rate increase effective January 1, 2023 for all customer classes. Additionally, the Board approved the Solar and Storage Rate, the optional residential Peak Pricing Rate, and updates to certain schedules of SMUD’s Open Access Transmission Tariff (“OATT”). The Board also approved a new timeline for the commercial rate restructure transition, and all impacted commercial customers were transitioned to the new rates by the end of the first quarter of 2022.

SMUD also implemented a solar interconnection fee based on the size of solar interconnection and supporting programs such as battery incentives, incentives to enroll in SMUD’s Peak Pricing Rate, battery incentives for Virtual Power Plants, and a program to bring the benefits of solar to under-resourced multi-family communities. These programs and fees are not subject to Board approval.

![2023 Rate Action](https://example.com/image.png)

**2023 Rate Action**

On September 21, 2023, the Board approved a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2024, a 2.75% rate increase effective January 1, 2025, and a 2.75% rate increase effective May 1, 2025 for all customer classes. The Board also approved establishing the Energy Assistance Program Rate (“EAPR”) Rate Stabilization Fund, which will provide an additional discount to those low-income customers with the greatest need. The discount will be funded with discretionary, non-retail rate revenue, as to not have an impact on any future required rate changes. There is currently pending litigation concerning the adoption of the 2023 rates. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”

**Rate Stabilization Funds**

The Rate Stabilization Fund (“RSF”) is maintained by SMUD to reduce the need for future rate increases when costs exceed existing rates. At the direction of the Board, amounts may be either transferred into the RSF (which reduces revenues) or transferred out of the RSF (which increases revenues). The Board authorizes RSF transfers on an event driven basis. The RSF includes funds to hedge variations in the volume of energy received from WAPA hydroelectric generation, variation in AB 32 revenue and variations in Low Carbon Fuel Credit (“LCFS”) revenue. As of December 31, 2023, the balance in the RSF was $115.8 million, which is approximately 7.2% of annual retail revenue.

Effective July 2008, SMUD implemented the HGA, which is a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from the UARP (see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric”). The HGA is designed to increase the deposits to the HRSF in wet years when SMUD has more hydroelectric generation than expected. Each year SMUD determines the impact of precipitation variances on projected hydroelectric generation from the UARP. When the precipitation variance results in a deficiency of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, transfers from the HRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is zero. When the precipitation variance results in a projected surplus of hydroelectric generation from the UARP, deposits will be made into the HRSF in an amount approximating the positive impact to SMUD from the surplus hydroelectric generation (up to 4% of revenues) until the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is not sufficient to cover transfers that would otherwise be made in the event of a projected deficiency in UARP hydroelectric generation, a 12-month HGA surcharge will automatically be included on customers’ electric bills at a level that generates up to 4% of retail revenue. If the balance in the HRSF is equal to 6% of budgeted retail revenue on any precipitation variance calculation date and the precipitation variance results in a projected UARP hydroelectric generation surplus, the positive impact of the surplus may be used for other purposes at staff’s recommendation, with the approval of the Board, including returned to customers through an electric bill discount up to 4% of retail revenue. SMUD calculates HRSF transfers based on an April-March (water year) precipitation period at Fresh Pond, California. This precipitation station is used to approximate available water supply to SMUD’s UARP hydropower reservoirs. As of January 31, 2024, and based on the current HRSF water year precipitation forecast, SMUD anticipates transferring $20.8 million out of the HRSF in April 2024.

In September 2023, SMUD added a pass-through rate component to deal with variations in hydroelectric generation from WAPA. Each year SMUD determines the WAPA Energy Delivery Variance (“EDV”) based on forecasted energy delivery minus the actual energy delivery. When the EDV variance is positive, transfers from the WRSF, which was created as a component of the RSF, to SMUD’s available cash, will be made in an amount approximating the cost to SMUD of replacement power (up to 2% of cash).

**Low Income Discount**

As of December 2023, approximately 91,407 customers received the low-income discount offered by SMUD, which represents approximately 16% of all residential customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, SMUD suspended recertification during the pandemic. In 2023, the total discount was approximately $32.7 million. As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic downturn, SMUD experienced an increase in low-income discount applicants. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Impacts from COVID-19 Pandemic.”

While the low-income discount has provided substantial benefits to low-income customer bills for years, multiple economic variables, such as inflation and rate increases, have had disproportionately negative impacts on low-income customers, particularly those in the 0-50% Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”). In 2023, SMUD established an EAPR Rate Stabilization Fund (“ERSF”) to provide an additional discount to the electricity usage charge up to an established maximum discount (“ERSF Additional Discount”) for customers in the 0-50% FPL. The ERSF is funded by discretionary non-retail rate revenue, reviewed on an annual basis, and the specific monthly ERSF Additional Discount is set before the year the value is in effect. SMUD expanded its programs and services starting in 2016 to help customers with energy assistance, home improvement packages and education. SMUD is creating tailored solutions to best meet the needs of low-income customers. These solutions include free solar panels and inspecting homes to identify energy saving and fuel switching opportunities. As of December 2023, SMUD has performed 30,000 energy retrofits and, in partnership with Grid Alternatives (a non-profit organization that focuses on implementing solar power and energy efficiency for low-income families), 230 customers have benefited from free solar installations. Forty-eight additional homes received solar and energy efficiency through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity of Greater Sacramento. As part of SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan and the focus on building electrification, SMUD has also been ramping up electrification investments for low-income customers. Additionally, since 2019, SMUD has assisted more than 2,600 households with electrification upgrades. Additionally, SMUD has installed nearly 450 electric vehicle chargers and more than 400 electric vehicle circuits in low-income households or areas that serve low-income customers.

# Customer Base: Largest Customers

A stabilizing influence on SMUD’s revenues is that a substantial proportion is derived from residential customers (49.2% in 2023). Historically, revenue from commercial and industrial consumption has been more sensitive to economic fluctuation. Furthermore, SMUD has no dominant customers that account for a significant percentage of annual revenues. In 2023, no single customer contributed more than 3% of revenues. The top ten customers generated approximately 9% of revenues and the top 30 generated approximately 15% of revenues. The following table presents information on SMUD’s top ten customers as of December 31, 2023.

# Power Generation Facilities

## Hydroelectric
The UARP consists of three relatively large storage reservoirs (Union Valley, Loon Lake and Ice House) with an aggregate water storage capacity of approximately 400,000 acre-feet and eight small reservoirs. Project facilities also include eight tunnels with a combined length of over 26 miles and eight powerhouses containing 11 turbines. In addition to providing clean hydroelectric power and operating flexibility for SMUD, the UARP area provides habitat for fish and wildlife and a variety of recreational opportunities, including camping, fishing, boating, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking and cross-country skiing.

The combined capacity of the UARP is approximately 685 MW at SMUD’s load center in Sacramento. Under current licensing and mean water conditions, these facilities are expected to generate approximately 1,600 GWh of electric energy annually, which represents approximately 15% of SMUD’s current average annual retail energy requirements. In 1957, the Federal Power Commission (predecessor agency to FERC) issued a license to SMUD for the UARP. This 50-year license was subsequently amended to add and upgrade facilities and now includes all segments of SMUD’s hydroelectric facilities located on the South Fork of the American River and its tributaries upstream from the Chili Bar Project (described below). On July 23, 2014, FERC issued to SMUD a new 50-year license for the UARP.

On November 9, 2016 FERC issued an Order authorizing SMUD to construct the South Fork Powerhouse downstream of the UARP’s Slab Creek Dam. Construction was substantially completed in the fall of 2020, and the new powerhouse was placed into operation on October 25, 2022, adding 1.8 MW of generation to the UARP’s overall capacity.

On June 16, 2021, pursuant to Board authorization, SMUD approved the Chili Bar Hydroelectric Project which consists of a 7 MW powerhouse, reservoir, dam and spillway, north of Placerville on the South Fork of the American River for approximately $10.4 million (the “Chili Bar Project”). The Chili Bar Project is immediately downstream from the UARP and operates as the regulating reservoir for the UARP’s largest powerhouse. Owning the UARP and the Chili Bar Project enables SMUD to operate the two projects with a holistic approach to license compliance and generation efficiency.

## Solano 2 Wind Project
SMUD owns and operates an 87 MW wind project, located in Solano County, known as Solano 2. Solano 2 consists of 29 wind turbine generators (“WTGs”) rated at 3.0 MW. Energy from the project is collected at 21 kV and transmitted over a dedicated 3-mile overhead system to the SMUD-owned Russell substation. At the Russell facility, the energy is transformed to 230 kV and interconnected to PG&E’s Birds Landing Switching Station. Energy deliveries are scheduled through the CAISO.

## Solano 3 Project
In 2011 and 2012, SMUD constructed a 128 MW wind project adjacent to Solano Phase 2, known as Solano 3. The Solano 3 project consists of 31 WTGs rated at 1.8 MW and 24 WTGs rated at 3.0 MW. The project interconnects through a 34.5 kV underground collection system to the Russell substation. Like the Solano Phase 2 project, this energy is transformed to 230 kV and delivered through the CAISO.

## Solano 4 Project
SMUD has developed the Solano 4 Wind Project on land with a wind easement owned by SMUD near the Solano 3 project, known as the Collinsville and Roberts properties, to install 10 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW, and to remove the Solano 1 turbines and replace them with 9 WTGs rated at 4.5 MW. SMUD has met all of the CAISO requirements and has executed a Large Generator Interconnection Agreement (“GLIA”) as of June 2021 that will allow for 90.8 MW of capacity at the point of interconnection. In April 2021, SMUD submitted an application for advisory review by the Solano County Airport Land Use Commission (the “Solano ALUC”) of the Solano 4 Wind Project’s consistency.

with the 2015 Travis Air Force Base Land Use Compatibility Plan (the “Travis Plan”). In May 2021, the Solano ALUC purported to resolve that the Solano 4 Wind Project was inconsistent with the Travis Plan. In August 2021, the Board approved the Project Environmental Impact Report, made findings overriding the Solano ALUC’s finding of inconsistency, made findings there was no alternative to the project, and approved the Solano 4 Wind Project. In September 2021, Solano County filed a writ petition challenging SMUD’s approval of the Solano 4 Wind Project based on procedural, environmental, zoning and land use grounds. The parties entered into a settlement agreement on December 14, 2022, and the suit was dismissed on January 10, 2023. The settlement agreement allows for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project as planned.

In addition, SMUD applied for and obtained extensions of the Federal Aviation Administration Determinations of No Hazard allowing for construction of the turbines. A contract for the construction of the Solano 4 Wind Project was awarded to Vestas Corporation and the Solano 4 Wind Project is currently under construction. The expected operation date for the Solano 4 Wind Project is May 2024. PG&E identified upgrades needed to interconnect the Solano 4 Wind Project that will not be complete before the expected Solano 4 commercial operation date. PG&E has an approved project and expects to complete the needed upgrades by May of 2025. Realization of the full capacity of the Solano 4 Wind Project may be delayed into the second quarter of 2025 due to the timeframe established for the PG&E required transmission upgrades. SMUD has developed a mitigation plan for the limited interconnection capacity for the first year of operation, in coordination with CAISO and PG&E, of using all of the existing SMUD Solano Russell substation interconnection capacity combined for the dispatch of all the Solano Wind Project. SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process, which combines all phases of the Solano 4 Wind Project so it may operate as one project. This was fully executed by SMUD, CAISO, and PG&E on February 27, 2023.

As of the end of 2023, all of the turbine site delivery roads and foundations for the Solano 4 Project have been completed, all of the turbine components have been delivered to the Solano 4 Project site and 10 of the Solano 4 Project turbines have been fully erected.

At the completion of the Solano 4 project, SMUD will have an installed wind capacity of 303 MW in connection with the overall Solano Wind Project, leaving 18 MW at the point of interconnection for future development.

**Distributed Solar Photovoltaic.** SMUD owns and operates approximately 2 MW of solar photovoltaic generating facilities. These facilities include installations at the Hedge Substation property, SMUD Headquarters, the East Campus Operations Center, and other smaller photovoltaic systems throughout the service area on parking lots.

**Hedge Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 4 MW, 8 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached commercial operation in January 2023.

**ESS Flow Battery.** SMUD owns and operates a 0.45 MW, 3 MWh, battery energy storage system located near the Hedge Substation in South Sacramento. The facility reached test operation in September 2023, and commercial operation is planned for March 2024.

**Local Gas-Fired Plants.** SMUD constructed five local natural gas-fired plants in its service area: the Carson Project, the Procter & Gamble Project, the Campbell Soup Project, McClellan and the Cosumnes Power Plant (each defined below). These five plants are referred to collectively as the “Local Gas-Fired Plants.” These plants are a strategic component of SMUD’s resource mix. In addition to providing SMUD a total capacity of approximately 1,139 MW, the Local Gas-Fired Plants provide SMUD with needed

**A-31**

**Local Gas-Fired Plants Overview**

SMUD has entered into long-term agreements with SFA providing for the purchase by SMUD of all of the power from each of the Local Gas-Fired Plants on a take-or-pay basis. This consolidation created operational and administrative efficiencies without changing any of the functionality of the power plants. Although the Local Gas-Fired Plants are owned by SFA, SMUD has exclusive control of their dispatch and manages their operations as part of its overall power supply strategy.

Payments under the power purchase agreements are payable from the revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of the principal of or interest on SMUD’s Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the caption “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below), as are other maintenance and operation costs and energy payments. For further discussion of SMUD’s obligations to make these payments to SFA, see “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS – Outstanding Indebtedness – Joint Powers Authorities.”

**Description of the Five Local Gas-Fired Plants:**

1. **The Cosumnes Power Plant (the “Cosumnes Power Plant”)**  
   The Cosumnes Power Plant is a 612 MW natural gas-fired, combined cycle plant located in the southern portion of Sacramento County adjacent to SMUD’s decommissioned Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant. Commercial operation of the Cosumnes Power Plant commenced on February 24, 2005. SFA increased the net generating capacity of the facility by 81 MWs via an Advanced Gas Path (“AGP”) upgrade. The additional AGP generation was realized after hardware and software upgrades were completed. The Cosumnes Power Plant is owned by SFA, a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and MID. The existing take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA expires no earlier than when the related bonds have been paid in full (the outstanding related bonds are scheduled to mature on July 1, 2030). On June 5, 2022, the Cosumnes Power Plant was shut down due to a ground fault in the STG stator. The repair was completed in February 2023 and the plant returned to service on March 5, 2023. See “FACTORS AFFECTING THE REGION – Cosumnes Power Plant Outage”.

2. **The Carson Cogeneration Project (the “Carson Project”)**  
   The Carson Project, a 103 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project consisting of separate cycle and peaking plants, provides steam to the Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) wastewater treatment plant adjacent to the site. The Carson Project was originally owned by the Central Valley Financing Authority (“CVFA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and the SRCSD. Construction of the Carson Project was completed and the plant began commercial operation on October 11, 1995. The CVFA bonds issued to finance the Carson Project were defeased in September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Carson Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

3. **The Procter & Gamble Cogeneration Project (the “Procter & Gamble Project”)**  
   The Procter & Gamble Project, a 182 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, is located in an established industrial area of Sacramento. The initial combined cycle portion of the plant began commercial operation on March 1, 1997. Construction of the peaking plant portion of the Procter & Gamble Project commenced during 2000 and the unit achieved commercial status on April 24, 2001. The Procter & Gamble Project produces steam for use in Procter & Gamble Manufacturing Company’s oleochemical manufacturing processes and electricity for sale to SMUD. The Procter & Gamble Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Cogeneration Authority (“SCA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA, a separate joint powers authority. The SCA bonds issued to finance the Procter & Gamble Project were defeased in.

September 2019. In late 2021, ownership of the Procter & Gamble Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Procter & Gamble Project will be in effect until terminated by SMUD.

**The Campbell Soup Cogeneration Project (the “Campbell Soup Project”).** The Campbell Soup Project, a 170 MW natural gas-fired cogeneration project, was completed and began commercial operations on December 4, 1997. Upgrades were implemented during 2000, which increased the plant’s peaking capacity to 180 MW, well above its net demonstrated capacity of 159.8 MW. The plant is located in south Sacramento adjacent to the Capital Commerce Center (formerly the Campbell Soup Company food processing facility). The Campbell Soup Project was originally owned by the Sacramento Power Authority (“SPA”), a joint powers authority formed by SMUD and SFA. The SPA bonds issued to finance the Campbell Soup Project were redeemed in July 2015. In late 2021, ownership of the Campbell Soup Project was transferred to SFA. The take-or-pay power purchase agreement between SMUD and SFA relating to the Campbell Soup Project (the “Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA”) covers both the Campbell Soup Project and McClellan and will be in effect until terminated by SMUD. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing the Campbell Soup Project in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**The McClellan Gas Turbine (“McClellan”).** McClellan is a 72 MW natural gas-fired simple cycle combustion turbine generating plant at McClellan Business Park in Sacramento. This turbine is connected to SMUD’s electric system and is operated to meet SMUD’s peak-load requirements. McClellan is aligned for remote starting and operation with black start and fast start capabilities. SMUD constructed the McClellan unit in 1986 as a 50 MW emergency power source for the McClellan Air Force Base. In 2001, following the Air Force base closure, McClellan was repurposed for SMUD’s use. In May 2007, SMUD transferred ownership of McClellan to SPA for more efficient operation. SPA did not issue debt related to McClellan. In late 2021, ownership of McClellan was transferred to SFA. SFA pays all costs of operations and maintenance through to SMUD in accordance with the terms of the Campbell Soup/McClellan PPA. In exchange for paying all costs related to McClellan, SMUD receives all of the power generated thereby on a take-or-pay basis. In support of the Zero Carbon Plan, SMUD is exploring replacing McClellan in 2026, contingent upon SMUD having sufficient other resources available and grid reliability can be maintained. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.”

**Fuel Supply**

**General.** SMUD is obligated to arrange for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Management of the natural gas procurement and delivery process is a key focus of SMUD’s reliability and risk policies. Although the natural gas consumption of the power plants for SMUD’s load can vary significantly depending on the season, precipitation, and the market price of power and natural gas, the plants are forecasted to need, on average in 2024, a total of approximately 91,000 Decatherms per day (“Dth/day”) with a daily peak slightly more than 171,000 Dth/day of natural gas. SMUD has implemented a comprehensive strategy to secure a reliable and diversified fuel supply through a variety of agreements for the supply, transportation, and storage of natural gas.

**Supply.** SMUD hedges a significant portion of its expected gas needs to meet customer power requirements. This includes gas for the Local Gas-Fired Plants and for the Sutter Energy Center. See “Power Purchase Agreements – Sutter Energy Center”. This is accomplished through a combination of long-term supply arrangements and an exposure reduction program. The program consists of a primarily rolling three-year exposure reduction component, a fuel hedging component on a rolling three-year basis, as well as supplemental fixed calendar year components reaching out up to five calendar years. Long-term

A-32

arrangements may consist of a combination of physical commodity supply contracts, financial hedges, or options. Natural gas is purchased from a wide variety of producers and marketers at the northern and southern California borders, and from the San Juan and the Rocky Mountain supply basins. SMUD has a number of both fixed-price supply agreements and financial hedging contracts to fix gas costs ranging from one month to several years in duration. Including fixed price biogas contracts as of February 29, 2024, these contracts are forecasted to have hedged the price exposure on approximately 100%, 82% and 81% of SMUD’s anticipated natural gas requirements for 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. While the financial effects resulting from the unhedged portions of SMUD’s natural gas requirements are difficult to predict, SMUD’s financial results could be materially impacted.

SMUD has contracted with NCGA to purchase an approximate average of 8,700 Dth/day over the remaining life of a contract expiring May 31, 2027 (the “NCGA Contract”). Under the NCGA contract, SMUD pays a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. Until November 1, 2023 the delivery point for the NCGA Contract was the AECO hub in Alberta. Starting November 1, 2023, to increase delivery efficiencies, SMUD has exchanged the gas delivered at the AECO hub under the NCGA Contract with gas delivered at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border. From there SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants.

SMUD has also contracted with NCEA to purchase an approximately 22,000 Dth/day on average, or to be converted to the appropriate cash flow value in Megawatt-hours (“MWh”) of electricity over the remaining life of a contract expiring on May 31, 2049. The gas will be delivered to the SMUD system via the Malin receipt point on the PG&E backbone system. SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver the fuel to the local area plants. SMUD will pay a discounted variable price for the fuel and anticipates periodically fixing the effective price under separate hedging contracts. In connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement), SMUD expects to amend and restate the contract with NCEA in connection with the issuance of the Bonds (as defined in the forpart of this Official Statement.)

**Renewable Natural Gas Supply.** As a component of meeting SMUD’s RPS goals, SMUD procures renewable natural gas and digesters gas as fuels to generate renewable electricity from the Cosumnes Power Plant. Descriptions of the renewable natural gas supply agreements are provided below.

In March 2009, SMUD entered into a 15-year contract (that qualifies as renewable energy) with Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (“Shell Energy”) to purchase up to 6,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from a landfill project in Texas. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in April 2009. In March 2012, SMUD amended the contract with Shell Energy to increase the maximum volumes to 7,300 Dth/day and extended the term by 10 years to March 31, 2034. Currently, the delivery point is PG&E Topock and SMUD is using its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In 2016, SMUD entered into a 3-year contract with Shell Energy to sell back the entire volume of renewable natural gas purchased, less 500 Dth/day, to be sold into the vehicle transportation markets. Upon expiration of the initial 3-year contract for the sale of biogas to Shell Energy, SMUD extended the sell back of the entire volume of biogas twice for an additional three years with Element Markets (now RNG, LLC), starting in 2020 and 2023. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

SMUD contracted with Heartland Renewable Energy, LLC (“HRE”) in December 2009 for a 20-year supply of up to 7,000 Dth/day of renewable natural gas from a digester facility in Colorado. Deliveries began in March of 2014. Currently, the delivery point is Opal, Wyoming and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. HRE has not delivered volumes from the project to SMUD since December 2016 due to litigation with Weld County, Colorado regarding odor and
<!-- Page 307 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

permit issues. EDF Renewables, the majority owner of HRE, notified SMUD in August of 2017 that it is in discussions with a short list of bidders to sell its interests in the facility. In June of 2020, the project was purchased and SMUD’s contract was assigned to the new owner, Platte River Biogas, LLC (“PRB”). SMUD and PRB reached a settlement in the third quarter of 2021 that could lead to terminating the contract.

In September 2011, SMUD and CVFA entered into a “Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement” through which the Carson Project cleans nearly all of the digester gas received from Sacramento Regional County Sanitation District (“SRCSD”) and sells it to SMUD for delivery to the Cosumnes Power Plant. In return, SMUD pays all of the Carson Project’s costs in acquiring, cleaning and making the gas available to SMUD. The Digester Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, along with the Carson Project was transferred to SFA. The Carson Project is currently receiving, processing and selling up to 1,500 Dth/day with provisions for volume increases over time to 2,500 Dth/day. Digester gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations.

In December 2011, SMUD entered into a 20-year agreement with EIF KC Landfill Gas LLC (“EIF”) to purchase up to 7,050 Dth/day of renewable natural gas produced from multiple landfill projects. SMUD began taking deliveries of this supply in January 2014. Currently the delivery point is Kern River – Opal and SMUD uses its long-term transport capacity to deliver it to the Cosumnes Power Plant. Renewable natural gas, when designated for use in SMUD’s power plants, is counted as renewable generation towards SMUD’s RPS obligations. In April 2022, SMUD entered into a transaction to sell the renewable natural gas purchased into the renewable natural gas markets. The transaction expires in March 2025. While SMUD sells the renewable natural gas, it does not count the renewable natural gas towards its RPS obligations.

AB 2196 is a law that defines the criteria by which existing and future renewable natural gas contracts will qualify for the State RPS program. The CEC adopted a RPS Eligibility Guidebook on April 30, 2013, which includes detailed rules for implementation of AB 2196. SMUD received an updated certificate of eligibility from the CEC in July 2014 for the Cosumnes Power Plant that included the quantities of renewable natural gas from all contracts. The CEC adopted a revised RPS Eligibility Guidebook (Ninth Edition) on April 27, 2017. This latest guidebook did not change the RPS eligibility of any of the above SMUD renewable natural gas and digester gas contracts, but did simplify reporting requirements for these contracts.

Gas Transmission

SMUD has satisfied its obligation to deliver natural gas to its power plants by constructing a natural gas pipeline, purchasing an equity interest in two PG&E backbone gas transmission lines, and contracting for capacity on a number of existing interstate natural gas transmission lines.

The Local Pipeline. SMUD constructed and owns a 20-inch, 50-mile natural gas pipeline in the greater Sacramento area (the “Local Pipeline”) that transports gas to all of the Local Gas-Fired Plants except McClellan. The Local Pipeline is interconnected with PG&E’s major State gas transmission lines 300 and 401. Additionally, it may be interconnected with one or more private gas gathering pipelines located in the area, a gas storage project and/or other FERC approved pipelines that may be built in the local area. In conjunction with the construction of the Cosumnes Power Plant, SMUD extended the Local Pipeline to the plant site. The 26-mile extension was completed in 2004. The extension is 24 inches in diameter and was designed to serve both the Cosumnes Power Plant and an additional second phase, if constructed.

![PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401](https://example.com/image.png)

**PG&E Backbone Gas Transmission Lines 300 and 401.** In 1996, SMUD purchased an equity interest in PG&E’s backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 (referred to as the PG&E backbone). The total capacity acquired at that time was approximately 85,000 Dth/day and consisted of approximately 43,600 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, Oregon and 44,700 Dth/day from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California. SMUD was also entitled to a share of non-firm capacity, which was approximately 4,360 Dth/day; making the total capacity potentially available to SMUD almost 90,000 Dth/day. This purchase made SMUD a co-owner of the PG&E backbone gas transmission lines 300 and 401 and obligated SMUD to pay PG&E to operate the pipelines on its behalf subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and operating protocols. PG&E reduced operating pressures on Line 300 after PG&E suffered a natural gas explosion in San Bruno, CA in September of 2010. Operating pressures and capacity may also fluctuate due to regulatory and other changes. As of December 1, 2021, SMUD holds a total capacity of approximately 87,000 Dth/day, consisting of approximately 47,572 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Oregon border at Malin, and 39,193 Dth/day of firm gas transport from the California-Arizona border at Topock, Arizona, to SMUD’s interconnection with the PG&E backbone near Winters, California.

**Kern River Gas Transmission Company Long Term Agreement.** SMUD has an agreement with Kern River Gas Transmission Company for 200,000 Dth/day of firm capacity through April 30, 2028. This capacity gives SMUD access to the Rocky Mountain supply basin at Opal, Wyoming, and connects to PG&E Line 300 (owned in part by SMUD) at Daggett, California.

SMUD’s diversified portfolio of gas transmission arrangements allows for the purchase of gas from a variety of suppliers and locations, and the opportunity to capitalize on regional price differentials where possible. In addition, it ensures diversity in the SMUD/PG&E backbone and South Pipeline enhances the reliability of SMUD’s gas supply.

**Gas Storage**

SMUD also employs gas storage as part of its overall fuel supply strategy. Gas storage is useful in helping to balance gas supply, mitigate market price volatility, and provide a reliable supply to meet peak day delivery requirements.

SMUD has a contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2023 and expires in March 2026, for capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity.

SMUD also has a second contract with Lodi Gas Storage, LLC, which began in April 2022 and expires in March 2024, for additional capacity in the Lodi Gas Storage project located near Acampo in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 1.0 million Dth of storage inventory, 10,000 Dth/day of injection rights and 20,000 Dth/day of withdrawal capacity. SMUD does not plan to renew this contract upon expiration.

SMUD has a contract with Wild Goose Storage LLC, that will begin in April 2024 (but which allows for early injection (December 2023 – March 2024)) for capacity in the Wild Goose Storage project located near Gridley in northern California. The contract provides SMUD with capacity levels of 0.2 million Dth of storage inventory, ratcheted (12,500-14,000 Dth/day) volumes of injection rights and ratcheted (10,000 – 24,000 Dth/day) volumes of withdrawal capacity.

# Power Purchase Agreements

SMUD has a number of power purchase agreements to help meet its power requirements. Some of these agreements are described below.

## Western Area Power Administration
Effective January 1, 2005, SMUD entered into a 20-year contract with WAPA. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement extending the term by 30 years for the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2054. Power sold under this contract is generated by the Central Valley Project (“CVP”), a series of federal hydroelectric facilities in northern California operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation. The contract provides WAPA’s CVP Base Resource customers (including SMUD) delivery of a percentage share of project generation in return for reimbursement of an equivalent share of project costs. SMUD’s CVP Base Resource share is roughly 25% of project generation and costs. This is expected to be approximately 318 MW of capacity and 661 GWh of energy in an average water year but will vary depending on precipitation. Energy available under the contract is determined by water releases required for water supply and flood control and is then shaped into higher value periods within other CVP operating constraints. More capacity and energy are typically available in spring and summer months and less in fall and winter.

SMUD also has a contract with WAPA expiring December 31, 2024, by which WAPA delivers an additional 200-300 MW per hour from projects located in the Pacific Northwest based on certain contractual parameters. In 2022, SMUD received 1,913 GWh of energy under this contract. SMUD has entered into a replacement agreement for the period January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2030.

## Avangrid (formerly Iberdrola Renewables (“Iberdrola”))
SMUD has a contract with Iberdrola for 126 GWh of wind power generated in Solano County, California. The SMUD Board approved an extension of the wind contract through June 30, 2025.

## Patua Project LLC
In April 2010, SMUD entered into a power purchase agreement with Patua Project LLC (“Patua”), a subsidiary of Gradient Resources, for the delivery of up to 132 MW (expected to be 120 MW nominal power output) of renewable energy from geothermal generation being developed in north central Nevada, from a Gradient Resources project known as the Patua Project. The Patua Project was to have been developed in three phases. Since 2010, the agreed upon capacity has been reduced several times. In December 2013, Phase 1 of the project, which had been reduced to 30 MW, finally achieved commercial operation. In 2014, the parties concluded negotiations on the fourth amendment to the power purchase agreement with Patua, which reduced the total capacity down to 40 MW, extended the commercial operation date of Phase 2 to January 1, 2016, and allowed Patua to add up to 13 MW of solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production. In addition, this amendment shifted responsibility to Patua for a portion of the long-term transmission service agreements that have been underutilized due to the project not meeting its targets. In November 2015, the Patua Project was acquired by TL Power, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cyrq Energy, Inc. (“Cyrq”). In December 2015, Cyrq terminated Phase 2. Upon termination of Phase 2, the contractual right for Cyrq to add solar photovoltaics to supplement geothermal production was reduced to 10 MW. As a result of poor performance during the first year of operation, SMUD reduced its obligation to take power from 30 MW to 25 MW. Performance continued to lag in 2015 and 2016 and SMUD further reduced its obligation to take power from 25 MW to 19 MW.

## Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff
In September 2009, SMUD’s Board authorized a feed-in tariff program for the purchase of renewable energy from local renewable energy projects connected to SMUD’s distribution system. SMUD’s Board authorized connection of up to 100 MW under the feed-in tariff which included standard payment rates and standard purchase terms for power. The feed-in tariff program became effective on January 1, 2010. Under the feed-in tariff, SMUD has executed 20-year term power purchase agreements.

A-36

agreements for solar projects totaling 98.5 MW. Construction and start-up were completed on all projects between 2010 and 2012.

**CalEnergy LLC.** In August 2014, SMUD entered into a 22-year power purchase agreement with CalEnergy LLC for the purchase of 30 MW per year of renewable energy from its Salton Sea geothermal facilities. As of July 1, 2017, SMUD began receiving up to 10 MW from the CalEnergy portfolio, which escalated to the full 30 MWs on May 1, 2020.

**Rancho Seco Solar.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Rancho Seco Solar LLC for the purchase of energy from a 10.88 MW solar PV project sited on SMUD’s property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station. Commercial operation was achieved in August of 2016. Rancho Seco Solar LLC leased the property from SMUD under a land lease agreement. The output of this project directly serves two large commercial customers that executed agreements with SMUD for retail supply of solar power.

In May 2019, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement for an additional 160 MW solar PV project with Rancho Seco Solar II, LLC. The project is located on SMUD-owned property at the closed Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station, adjacent to the existing 10.88 MW solar PV project. Construction began in 2019, and the project became commercially operable in February 2021.

**Grady Wind Energy.** In October 2015, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Grady Wind Energy LLC (“Grady”) for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW wind project located in New Mexico (the “Grady Project”). The Grady Project began commercial operations on August 5, 2019. Energy from the Grady Project is delivered to CAISO. SMUD purchases 100% of the Grady Project output, which includes energy, renewable energy credits, and capacity attributes.

**Great Valley Solar 2, LLC.** In January 2017, SMUD entered into a 20-year power purchase agreement with Great Valley Solar 2, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 60 MW solar PV project located in Fresno County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was December 28, 2017.

**ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC.** On September 14, 2016, Senate Bill 859 (“SB 859”) was signed into law. Under SB 859, a POU must procure its proportionate share of 125 MW of renewable energy from biomass plants burning high hazard forest fuels, subject to terms of at least five years. Seven POUs (SMUD, MID, Turlock Irrigation District (“TID”), Anaheim Public Utilities, Imperial Irrigation District, and Angeles Department of Water & Power and Riverside Public Utilities, collectively described herein as the “ARP-Loyalton POUs”) jointly solicited proposals for up to 29 MW of contract capacity for renewable energy to meet the requirements of SB 859. In January 2018, SMUD entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC to fulfill 18 MW of the required 29 MW with SMUD’s share being just over 23 percent (the “ARP-Loyalton PPA”). See “—Roseburg Forest Products Co.” below for a discussion of the remaining SB 859 capacity. The contract became effective on April 1, 2018. On February 18, 2020, ARP-Loyalton Cogen LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and stopped producing and selling energy from the biomass plant. On May 7, 2022, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the Loyalton facility to Sierra Valley Enterprises, LLC (“SVE”). SVE initially expressed interest in bringing the facility back into service; however, the bankruptcy trustee requested requested extension of the deadline for SVE to accept or reject the ARP-Loyalton PPA. The latest deadline was April 19, 2023, the date of expiration of the ARP-Loyalton PPA terms. SVE did not resume operations before the end of the ARP-Loyalton PPA term, the ARP-Loyalton POUs have negotiated a settlement agreement with the bankruptcy trustee (the “ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement”). The ARP-Loyalton Settlement Agreement, which SMUD executed and is filed with the court, defines funds from the performance security that the ARP-Loyalton POUs will keep to cover legal and administrative fees, along with a contingency amount to cover potential risk of future damages. Since the ARP-Loyalton POUs entered into a five-year agreement to

A-37

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

procure compliant biomass and provided SVE the opportunity to accept the ARP-Loyalton PPA and restart operations, the ARP-Loyalton POUs consider their statutory obligations to have been fulfilled.

**Roseburg Forest Products Co.** For the remaining SB 859 biomass obligation of 11 MW, SMUD and the other ARP-Loyalton POUs have entered into a five-year power purchase agreement with Roseburg Forest Products Co. SMUD’s share of the contract capacity is 2.5795 MW, and the plant began operating under the contract on February 26, 2021.

**Sutter Energy Center.** SMUD entered into an initial two-year contract (with a third-year exercisable option) with Calpine Energy Services, L.P. (“Calpine”) for the ability to schedule up to 258 MW of energy from Sutter Energy Center. The Sutter Energy Center is a natural gas-fired, combined-cycle facility located in Yuba City, California. The initial contract became effective on April 1, 2018. SMUD exercised its option to extend the contract, which expired November 1, 2020. SMUD entered into a new contract with Calpine for the same 258 MW of energy that became effective January 1, 2021, and had an original expiration date of January 1, 2024. In December 2021, SMUD extended this contract through December 31, 2026.

**Drew Solar, LLC.** In June 2018, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Drew Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 100 MW solar PV project located in Imperial County, California. The project’s scheduled commercial operation date was set to be December 31, 2021. The commercial operation date was delayed due to Force Majeure claims surrounding the COVID pandemic and supply chain constraints caused by changes in Federal regulatory requirements. The project began commercially operating on November 3, 2022.

**Wildflower Solar, LLC.** In October 2018, SMUD entered into a 25-year power purchase agreement with Wildflower Solar I, LLC, for the purchase of energy, capacity, and RECs from a 13 MW solar PV project located in Rio Linda, California. The project began commercially operating on December 18, 2020.

**Coyote Creek (Formerly Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC.)** In August 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Sacramento Valley Energy Center, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 200 MW solar PV and 100 MW four-hour Battery Energy Storage System (“BESS”) capacity project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but has been delayed to 2026 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

**SloughHouse Solar, LLC.** In September 2021, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with SloughHouse Solar, LLC for the purchase of energy from a 50 MW solar PV project located in Sacramento County, California. The project’s commercial operation date was originally expected to be December 31, 2023, but the commercial operation date has been delayed to March 31, 2025 due to ongoing development and permitting delays.

**Country Acres Solar.** In November 2023, SMUD entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement with Country Acres Clean Power LLC for the purchase of energy from a 344 MW solar PV project, with a 20-year term for 172 MW four-hour BESS capacity, located in Placer County, California. The project’s commercial operation is expected to be December 15, 2026.

**Geysers Power Company, LLC.** In March 2021, SMUD executed a 10-year power purchase agreement with Geysers Power Company, LLC for 100 MW of energy and capacity from the Geysers geothermal energy plant located in Lake and Sonoma Counties, California. SMUD started to receive deliveries on January 1, 2023.

# Transmission Service Agreements

## TANC California-Oregon Transmission Project
The 340-mile COTP is one part of a three 500-kV line coordinated system known as the California-Oregon Intertie (“COI”). The COTP is allocated one-third of the 4,800 MW capability of the COI system (see related agreements below). TANC is entitled to 1,390 MW and is obligated to pay approximately 80% of the operating costs of the COTP. SMUD is a member of TANC and a party to Project Agreement No. 3 (“PA3”), under which it is entitled to 378 MW and obligated to pay on an unconditional take-or-pay basis about 27.5% of TANC’s COTP debt service and operations costs, subject to a “step-up” obligation of up to 25% of its entitlement share upon the unremedied default of another TANC member-participant. In 2009, SMUD entered into a long-term layoff agreement with certain members that increased SMUD’s entitlement by 35 MW. In 2014, SMUD entered into another long-term layoff agreement with certain other members that increased SMUD’s COTP entitlements by 128 MW and amended the 2009 layoff agreement that returned 13 MW to a member. In January 2024, SMUD entered into an agreement to extend the 2009 long-term layoff agreement with certain members to January 31, 2034. As of January 31, 2024, SMUD was entitled to approximately 528 MW of TANC’s transfer capability for imports and 405 MW for exports, and is obligated to pay approximately 38.6% of COTP debt service and operations costs. SMUD’s payments under this contract, like SMUD’s payments under its other power purchase and transmission service agreements, are treated as “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the resolutions securing the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds (each as defined under the section “CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS” below). SMUD relies on its COTP rights to purchase power, access contingency reserves through the Western Power Pool, and obtain renewable resources to supplement its own resources to serve its load. TANC maintains insurance coverage on a per unit/casualty insurance program. TANC’s budget for COTP costs, support services and advocacy expenses is about $45.4 million for 2023. SMUD’s obligation on the TANC budget is about $8.5 million for 2023.

## TANC Tesla-Midway Transmission Service
TANC has a long-term contract with PG&E to provide TANC with 300 MW of transmission service between PG&E’s Midway Substation and the electric systems of the TANC Members (the “Tesla-Midway Service”). SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service had been 46 MW. As part of the 2009 long-term layoff agreement, SMUD acquired an additional 2 MW of South-of-Tesla Principles (“SOTP”) transmission rights for 15 years starting February, 2009 from another TANC member, bringing SMUD’s share of the Tesla-Midway Service to 48 MW.

## Bonneville Power Administration
In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with the Bonneville Power Administration (“BPA”) for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service from BPA’s Hilltop substation in northeastern California to the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua geothermal project over BPA’s 230kV transmission lines. In early 2013, in accordance with BPA’s transmission tariff, the transmission service was split into two 30 MW services and deferred as appropriate to better fit the timing of expected commercial operation of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Purchase Agreements – Patua Project LLC.” SMUD submitted another request for the 30 MW of transmission procured for Phase 2 of the Patua Project to split the service into a 10 MW and a 20 MW service, with the 10 MW service deferred and timed with the originally expected commercial operation date of Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 1 of the Patua Project and SMUD’s reduced obligation due to the poor performance of Phase 1 of the Patua Project, much of the transmission reserved for it will no longer be needed. BPA does not have a provision in its transmission tariff for early termination of transmission service. However, the power purchase agreement with Patua requires Patua to cover unused transmission that SMUD has procured for the Patua purchases. On January 1, 2020, SMUD’s transmission rights with BPA were reduced to 19 MW. This now aligns with SMUD’s PacifiCorp transmission rights of 19 MW described in the immediately following paragraph.

A-39
<!-- Page 313 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**PacifiCorp.** In 2009, SMUD entered into a transmission service agreement with PacifiCorp for 60 MW of firm point-to-point transmission service across PacifiCorp’s high voltage step-up transformer at the Malin substation at the California-Oregon border for the purpose of transmitting power under SMUD’s power purchase agreement with Gradient Resources for Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In early 2013, in accordance with PacifiCorp’s transmission tariff, the commencement of the 60 MW of transmission service was deferred to fit the timing of first deliveries expected from the 30 MW of Phase 1 of the Patua Project. In 2013, SMUD terminated the 60 MW of transmission service and requested two new transmission services of 30 MW each, with service start dates timed to better fit with the expected start dates of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the reduction in expected output of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the second 30 MW transmission agreement, and replaced it with a 10 MW transmission service agreement for Phase 2 of the Patua Project. With the termination of Phase 2 of the Patua Project, SMUD terminated the 10 MW PacifiCorp transmission service agreement and as a result of the reduced obligation to take power from the Patua Project, SMUD has reduced its remaining PacifiCorp transmission service from 30 MW to 19 MW.

**Western Area Power Administration.** SMUD does not have a direct interconnection of its power system to the COTP. To receive power deliveries that use its COTP rights, SMUD has a long-term transmission service agreement with WAPA for transmission of 342 MW of power from the COTP line (received at WAPA’s Tracy or Olinda substations) to SMUD’s system. In May of 2011, WAPA completed the Sacramento Voltage Support Transmission Project. Completion of this project has given SMUD an additional 165 MW of transmission service rights on WAPA’s system from the COTP at the Olinda Substation to SMUD’s system at the Elverta Substation.

**Projected Resources**

The following tables titled “Projected Requirements and Resources to Meet Load Requirements Energy Requirements and Resources” (the “Energy Table”) and “Capacity Requirements and Resources Net Capacity – Megawatts” (the “Capacity Table”) describe SMUD’s contracted commitments and owned resources available to meet its forecasted load requirements through the year 2033. Resources are shown on an annualized basis with market purchases netted against surpluses to arrive at a single net position for each year. Because SMUD’s available resources do not exactly match its actual load requirements on an hourly basis, there are times during a year when resources available will either exceed or be insufficient to meet SMUD’s needs. Expected actual capacity values are included in the tables. These values may differ from measured net demonstrated capacity values of the Local Area Gas-Fired Plants. The table below also includes the impact energy efficiency has on resources requirements as discussed below under “Demand Side Management Programs.” See “BUSINESS STRATEGY” and “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.”

Resources listed in both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table are listed as either renewable or non-renewable. Generally, SMUD follows the CEC guidelines for eligibility requirements. Some of SMUD’s renewable resources listed include solar, wind, geothermal, small hydroelectric facilities with a capacity of 30 MW or less, and biomass (representing generation from a fuel comprised of agricultural wastes and residues, landscape and tree trimmings, wood and wood waste).

As in any forecast, assumptions are made. In both the Energy Table and the Capacity Table the WAPA and UARP forecasts assume average water conditions throughout the period. On the capacity table, WAPA and Cosumnes Power Plant renewable capacity is estimated based on the ratio of renewable energy to total WAPA or Cosumnes Power Plant energy. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Hydroelectric.”

The Uncommitted Purchases (Sales) on the tables represent either anticipated future needs or surpluses. Future needs are met well in advance of delivery. They also include both renewable and non-renewable resources.

The Transmission Losses represent reductions in the amount of energy or capacity from the location it was purchased to the point of entering SMUD’s electrical system. This amount reduces the Total Resources available to meet the Total Projected Energy Requirements of the electrical system.

## Demand Side Management Programs

SMUD’s demand-side management initiatives represent an integral element of its total resource portfolio, and are organized into two major components: energy efficiency and load management programs. Energy efficiency offerings include a wide variety of programs and services to customers to retrofit or upgrade existing equipment and fixtures and to install new energy efficiency measures in existing and new construction facilities. Load management allows SMUD to reduce the load on the electric system by cycling residential air conditioning, and calling upon commercial/industrial customers to curtail energy usage when energy is constrained during the summer or system emergencies. Load management programs are projected to allow SMUD to shed approximately 60 MW of peak load in an emergency on a hot day, representing about 2% of SMUD’s maximum system peak demand.

The customer “smart meter” system with 2-way communication capability provides information regarding customer usage patterns, which is expected to help SMUD tailor rate designs that provide customers with both the information and ability to manage their energy usage around high energy cost periods.

# Balancing Authority Area Agreements

## Background
SMUD began operating as an independent control area, later termed a Balancing Authority, on June 18, 2002 within the WECC reliability organization’s region. This reduced SMUD’s exposure to the costs and reliability risks of the CAISO’s markets. SMUD expanded its operational footprint beyond SMUD’s service territory to include WAPA’s electric system, including the MID, Roseville, and Redding service areas (on January 1, 2005) and the COTP (on December 1, 2005). As described further below, SMUD ceased to be the Balancing Authority on April 30, 2011, as BANC took SMUD’s place as the Balancing Authority. SMUD remains the operator of the Balancing Authority through a contract with BANC. SMUD administers the contracts with WAPA and TANC to provide specified Balancing Authority-related and other services, and is compensated by WAPA and TANC. TANC recovers such Balancing Authority services costs as a part of its annual operating budget from the COTP Participants and WAPA recovers its Balancing Authority services costs through its rates for power and transmission service. The agreement with WAPA, among other terms, establishes operating procedures and reserve obligations between the parties and terminates on December 31, 2024. BANC, SMUD and WAPA will develop successor agreements in 2024 to take effect upon expiration of the existing contract. WAPA in turn has agreements with electric systems connected to it to assure that such systems also operate reliably (i.e., MID, Roseville and Redding). As a result of the transition to BANC as the Balancing Authority, SMUD assigned or terminated its interconnection and operations agreements with other connecting Balancing Authority areas (i.e., CAISO, BPA and TID). BANC is now the party to these agreements as they primarily address only Balancing Authority matters required for compliance with the reliability standards issued by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (“NERC”), such as emergency assistance arrangements. See also “OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY” – Western Energy Imbalance Market.”

## Reliability Standards
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 gave FERC authority to enforce reliability standards for the bulk electric system. In June 2007, these standards became mandatory for SMUD and BANC.

In 2022, SMUD and BANC underwent a combined NERC/WECC audit to evaluate compliance with applicable reliability standards. These audits occur every three years. At the conclusion of the audit, regulators determined that neither entity had any compliance violations related to the Operations and Planning or Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards. SMUD and BANC will undergo another NERC/WECC audit sometime in 2025.

## Balancing Authority of Northern California
SMUD, MID, Redding and Roseville executed a Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement (the “BANC JPA Agreement”) creating BANC on May 8, 2009. BANC became operational on May 1, 2011 as a Balancing Authority and replaced SMUD as the entity responsible for Balancing Authority-related reliability standards. Since that time, the Trinity Public Utilities District and the City of Shasta Lake have also become members of BANC. As provided in the BANC member agreement, liability for penalties associated with such Balancing Authority-related reliability standards are shared on a pro rata basis among the members of BANC. SMUD is the Balancing Authority operator under contract and performs Balancing Authority operational functions on behalf of BANC, much as it did when it was the Balancing Authority. The BANC JPA Agreement assigns cost responsibility based on member load within the BANC Balancing Authority, with SMUD representing approximately 70% of the total load.

## Power Pool and Other Agreements

### Western Power Pool Agreement
The Western Power Pool (“WPP”) is an agreement among over 30 utilities and public agencies in the western United States to coordinate contingency reserve sharing.
<!-- Page 318 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Displayed)

referred to as the WPP Reserve Sharing Program (“RSP”). The RSP permits participants to rely on one another in the event that any participant experiences a generating resource outage. While SMUD became an RSP participant in 2009, participation is limited to Balancing Authorities, which SMUD relinquished to BANC in 2011. Under the RSP, BANC and TID (also a WPP member) share their reserve amounts and when necessary and when sufficient unused COTP rights and capacity are available, may call upon WPP reserves from the RSP member systems in the Pacific Northwest. The WPP RSP permits members to operate more efficiently by reducing the contingency reserves that they would otherwise need to have available if they could not rely on each other.

**TANC-SMUD OASIS Administration Agreement.** SMUD entered into an agreement with TANC to provide OASIS services (transmission sales and scheduling related services in the BANC BA of TANC members’ COTP rights) on September 29, 2005. SMUD is compensated for performing these services. TANC and SMUD entered into a letter agreement dated October 25, 2010 to clarify each party’s role for regulatory reliability standards compliance responsibilities and take into account SMUD’s increased efforts related to supporting TANC’s compliance requirements. SMUD and TANC entered into an agreement to transition this service to the Western Area Power Administration, effective on May 1, 2023. Going forward SMUD will only have a minor role in receiving payments and distributing revenues to the TANC members.

**Other Interconnection Agreements**

**Background.** SMUD’s electric system was originally purchased from PG&E in 1947. SMUD’s service area is mostly surrounded by PG&E’s and WAPA’s service areas. The SMUD and PG&E electric systems are interconnected at SMUD’s Rancho Seco and Lake 230-kV substations. SMUD and WAPA are interconnected at SMUD’s Hurley, Elverta, Natomas and Folsom 230-kV substations.

**PG&E Interconnection Agreement.** PG&E and SMUD executed a Replacement Interconnection Agreement (“RIA”) which became effective on January 1, 2010. The RIA provides that SMUD and PG&E operate their interconnections reliably, plan their electric systems to meet their load requirements, and avoid or mitigate impacts the cause by certain electric system modifications. The agreement has a termination date of December 31, 2024, subject to FERC approval. SMUD and other Northern California utilities have similar interconnection agreements with PG&E, albeit with different expiration dates. PG&E filed a successor interconnection agreement with one of these utilities, TID, on November 1, 2023, to become effective on January 1, 2024. Many interconnection customers, including SMUD, intervened and submitted comments or protests in the FERC docket. FERC accepted the filing and TID and PG&E are now in a settlement process, pending litigation of the parties action and resolve the disputed items. SMUD anticipates that PG&E will seek to negotiate a successor interconnection agreement with SMUD which will be informed by the TID settlement or litigation process. While some functional mechanisms in the interconnection agreement may change, SMUD expects that its successor interconnection agreement will substantially preserve the balance of burdens and benefits consistent with FERC’s standard of requiring rates and terms of service that are just and reasonable. SMUD expects this process to be completed by the current expiration date of the RIA.

**PG&E Generator Interconnection Agreements.** SMUD signed a LGIA with CAISO and PG&E for the Solano 3 Wind Project, effective December 16, 2008, with a 50-year term. The Solano 2 Wind Project has interconnection rights granted through a LGIA, also with the CAISO and PG&E. The agreement became effective in January 2010 and has a term of 20 years. On June 3, 2021, SMUD entered into a LGIA with the CAISO and PG&E, for the planned 90.8 MW Solano 4 Wind project with a 10-year term and automatic renewal for successive one-year terms thereafter. On February 27, 2023, SMUD completed a combined LGIA amendment administrative process which combines the Solano 2, 3 & 4 projects into one Solano Wind Project. The original agreement conditions for the individual projects are carried forward with

A-45
<!-- Page 319 -->
a new combined project maximum production limit of 320.8 MW at the point of interconnection at the Russell Substation.

Other PG&E generator interconnection agreements include a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for Slab Creek with a 22-year term which became effective on January 14, 2010, and a Small Generator Interconnection Agreement with PG&E for the Chili Bar Project with a 10-year term which became effective on June 2, 2021.

WAPA Interconnection Agreement and other WAPA Agreements. SMUD and WAPA executed an interconnection agreement on May 8, 2008 for a term of 40 years which establishes the terms and conditions under which the SMUD and WAPA transmission systems are interconnected and memorializes related understandings. SMUD is working with WAPA on a reconfiguration at the shared Elverta interconnection to increase reliability and accommodate new generation interconnection in the area. SMUD has other agreements with WAPA including for operation of the Sutter Energy Center generating facility, communication systems terms and fiber optic access, training and for use of WAPA labor and heavy equipment to assist SMUD’s maintenance activities on an as-available basis.

**Management’s Discussion of SMUD’s Operating Results**

**Year Ended December 31, 2023.** For the year ended December 31, 2023, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $218.1 million as compared to an increase of $70.7 million for 2022.

Operating revenues were $228.5 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower sales of surplus gas ($118.3 million), transfers to the RSF ($67.2 million), sales to customers ($28.3 million), transfers from the RSF ($21.9 million), and LCFS revenue ($3.9 million), partially offset by higher sales of surplus power ($136.6 million), AB 32 revenue ($3.7 million), customer fees ($1.1 million), and lower transmission revenue ($2.3 million).

Operating expenses were $292.8 million lower than 2022. This was primarily due to lower purchased power expenses ($175.5 million), production operating expenses ($146.4 million), depreciation expenses ($22.7 million), production maintenance expenses ($12.3 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($7.2 million), partially offset by higher administrative and general expenses ($33.4 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($15.8 million), public good expenses ($8.8 million), and customer service and information expenses ($6.6 million).

Non-Operating income increased by $55.2 million primarily due to fair market value assessment and gain on sale of land ($33.3 million), higher interest income ($21.7 million), higher unrealized holding gains ($11.4 million), higher CCA revenue ($5.7 million), partially offset by lower investment income ($39.1 million).

Interest expense decreased $27.9 million from 2022.

**Year Ended December 31, 2022.** For the year ended December 31, 2022, SMUD reported an increase in net position of $70.7 million as compared to an increase of $347.3 million for 2021.

Operating revenues were $363.0 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher sales to customers ($130.7 million), sales of surplus gas ($96.0 million), sales of surplus power ($62.2 million), transfers to the RSF ($28.9 million), transfers from the RSF ($24.3 million), customer fees ($9.5 million), AB 32 revenue ($4.9 million) and LCFS revenue ($2.2 million), partially offset by lower gain on sale of carbon allowance futures ($3.7 million).

Operating expenses were $601.2 million higher than 2021. This was primarily due to higher purchased power expenses ($263.6 million), amortization of pension and OPEB ($126.9 million), production operating expenses ($125.1 million), depreciation expenses ($49.5 million), transmission and distribution maintenance expenses ($22.1 million), production maintenance expenses ($18.4 million), transmission and distribution operating expenses ($8.1 million), public good expenses ($7.4 million), and customer service and information expenses ($4.5 million), partially offset by lower administrative and general expenses ($27.4 million).

Non-Operating income decreased by $19.0 million primarily due to lower grant revenue ($39.6 million), unrealized holding losses ($3.7 million), partially offset by higher investment income ($19.7 million), closeout of escrow account ($2.8 million), and loss on asset retirements ($1.9 million).

Interest expense increased $19.5 million from 2021.

**Regulatory Assets.** In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” SMUD defers, as regulatory assets, certain types of expenditures. These assets are amortized and collected through future rates.

As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had a total of $916.1 million recorded for regulatory assets. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 68 which requires SMUD to record a net pension liability was $323.5 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 68 was $174.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with costs related to implementation of GASB No. 75 which requires SMUD to record a net Other Post Employment Benefit (OPEB) liability was $268.2 million and deferred outflows related to GASB No. 75 was $39.6 million at December 31, 2023. Regulatory assets associated with Rancho Seco decommissioning costs totaled $108.0 million at December 31, 2023. Nuclear fuel storage costs and non-radiological decommissioning costs have been collected in rates since 2009. For a complete description of these regulatory assets, see Note 8 (Regulatory Deferrals) to SMUD’s financial statements.

The Board has authorized the deferral of any charges or credits that result from the change in valuation of ineffective hedges that should be reported as Investment Revenue/Expense on the Statements of Revenues, Expenses and changes in net position. The Board’s resolution establishes that such charges or credits are not included in rates based on market value changes but are included in rates when the underlying transactions occur. Therefore, under GASB No. 62, “Regulated Operations,” any such changes are included in the Statement of Net Position as regulatory assets or liabilities. For a complete description of these derivative financial instruments, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s financial statements.

RANCHO SECO DECOMMISSIONING

Overview. The 913 MW Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant (“Rancho Seco”) began regulatory oversight by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (“NRC”) licensed operator in June 1989, but was shut down. In 1991, SMUD submitted a report (the “Financial Assurance Plan”) providing financial assurance to the NRC that SMUD will have sufficient funds available to pay for the cost of decommissioning. On March 17, 1992, the NRC granted SMUD a change from operating to a possession-only license for Rancho Seco that relieved SMUD from compliance with a number of NRC regulations applicable to operating nuclear power plants. SMUD also filed a proposed decommissioning plan with the NRC (the “Decommissioning Plan”), which was approved in March 1995.

After the decommissioning efforts began, no suitable disposal option was available to SMUD for the Class B and Class C low level radioactive waste generated during the plant decommissioning. With the used nuclear fuel stored onsite requiring oversight staff, SMUD opted to store the Class B and Class C radioactive waste in an existing interim onsite storage building until a suitable disposal option was available. In November 2007, the possession-only license for Rancho Seco was amended to update the Decommissioning Plan to terminate the possession-only license for the Class B and Class C waste in two phases. Phase I of the decommissioning was completed at the end of 2008. Following verification of the site conditions, SMUD submitted a request to the NRC to reduce the licensed facility from 2,480 acres to the interim onsite storage building and about one acre surrounding it. The request was approved by the NRC in September 2009. Phase II of decommissioning included the approximately two-acre interim storage building containing the Class B and Class C radioactive waste and surrounding area. In September 2013, SMUD entered into a contract with the operator of the low-level radioactive waste disposal facility located in Andrews, Texas. Shipment of the Class B and Class C radioactive waste for disposal was completed in November 2014. SMUD conducted additional clean-up activities and radiological surveys, which were followed by NRC confirmatory surveys. The results of these surveys demonstrated unit dose criteria well below NRC release criteria, and the NRC approved the Phase II area for unrestricted use. On September 21, 2017, SMUD formally requested the termination of the possession-only license. On August A-51

31, 2018, the NRC officially terminated SMUD’s possession-only license for the remaining Class B and Class C waste at Rancho Seco.

As part of the Decommissioning Plan, the nuclear fuel and Greater Than Class C (“GTCC”) radioactive waste is being stored in a dry storage facility (the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation or “ISFSI”) constructed by SMUD, adjacent to the former reactor facility. The NRC has separately licensed this facility. The DOE, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, is responsible for permanent disposal of used nuclear fuel and GTCC radioactive waste. SMUD has a contract with the DOE for the removal and disposal of this waste. The DOE was to have a waste repository operating by 1998, but has experienced significant and ongoing delays. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act designates Yucca Mountain in Nevada as the final and exclusive repository for the nation’s used nuclear fuel. The DOE discontinued the Yucca Mountain license review activities in 2010, but after a court ordered the NRC to resume its review in 2013, the NRC published its final safety evaluation report in 2015. The final safety report, and the final environmental impact statement, concluded that the proposed repository would be safe and environmentally sound for one million years.

Nevertheless, seeking alternatives to Yucca Mountain, the Blue-Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear Future delivered its final report in January 2012 with several recommendations. The DOE responded to the recommendations by issuing a report in January 2013 (Strategy for the Management and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste). Key to both documents is a focus on used fuel from decommissioned sites including Rancho Seco. The DOE report accepts most of the Blue-Ribbon Commission recommendations, and contains timelines for fuel management options which proposed removing the fuel from Rancho Seco as early as 2021. However, any progress on the strategies proposed by the DOE is dependent on legislative action by Congress. With no legislative action taken to date, the 2021 projected date for removal slips year-for-year. Therefore, SMUD continues to incur costs at this time when the DOE will fulfill its contractual obligations to remove the nuclear fuel and GTCC waste from the Rancho Seco facility. In the meantime, SMUD continues to incur costs of approximately $5 to $7 million per year for storage of used nuclear fuel at the ISFSI. SMUD has filed a series of successful lawsuits against the federal government for recovery of past spent fuel costs. SMUD has recovered over $14 million in 2023. SMUD plans to continue pursuing cost recovery claims to ensure it is reimbursed for all such costs in the future. The ISFSI will be decommissioned, and its license terminated after the fuel and GTCC is removed.

Financial Assurance Plan. In accordance with the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD established and funded an external decommissioning trust fund currently held by Computershare Corporate Trust (the “Decommissioning Trust Fund”). Pursuant to the Financial Assurance Plan, SMUD made the final deposit into the Decommissioning Trust Fund in 2008. Additional deposits are not expected but will be made if increased cost estimates or reduced fund interest earnings require it. In 2011, the NRC began requiring that SMUD demonstrate financial assurance for decommissioning the ISFSI as well as the former power facility, increasing the overall cost for decommissioning Rancho Seco. The estimated total cost for decommissioning the ISFSI was approximately $7.1 million on December 31, 2023. The decommissioning cost estimate is required to be updated every three years. As of December 31, 2023, the balance of the Decommissioning Trust Fund was $9.4 million, excluding unrealized gains and losses. Based on the current decommissioning cost estimate and the value of the fund, SMUD’s existing Decommissioning Trust Fund provides sufficient funds to complete decommissioning and terminate the ISFSI license.

In addition to these costs, SMUD also estimates that it would cost approximately $13.1 million to restore the site to make it available for other SMUD uses with some major structures remaining intact. Site restoration is not a legal requirement. No site restoration is currently underway.

# EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

SMUD has approximately 2,334 employees, most of whom are covered by a civil service system. SMUD is a contracting member of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“PERS”). Approximately 50% of SMUD’s work-force is represented as to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment, by one of three recognized employee organizations, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (“IBEW”) Local 1245, the Organization of SMUD Employees (“OSE”), and the SMUD Public Safety Officers’ Association (“PSOA”). The remaining 50% of SMUD’s workforce, which includes managers, professional, administrative, supervisory, confidential and security staff, is unrepresented.

SMUD negotiated a four-year Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with IBEW and the OSE, effective January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2025. Both contracts contain a no-strike/no-lockout clause effective during the life of the agreements. SMUD has an MOU with PSOA effective through December 31, 2026. SMUD has experienced only one labor interruption, which occurred in January 1980 that lasted four days.

# RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND POST-EMPLOYMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS

## Pension Plans

SMUD participates in PERS, an agent multiple-employer public employee defined benefit pension plan. PERS provides retirement and disability benefits, annual cost-of-living adjustments, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. PERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State. Benefit provisions are established by State statute and SMUD policies. The pension plan provides retirement benefits, survivor benefits, and death and disability benefits based upon employees’ years of credited service, age, and final compensation.

As of June 30, 2022, the last actuarial valuation date for SMUD’s plan within PERS, the market value of the SMUD plan assets was $2.32 billion. The plan is 87.8% funded on a market value of assets basis, a decrease of 12.3% compared to the June 30, 2021 funded status based on the market value of assets.

As an employer, SMUD is required to contribute a percentage of payroll each year to PERS to fund SMUD’s plan based on actuarial valuations performed by PERS. PERS collects the normal cost based on a percentage of payroll and the unfunded liability portion is based on a dollar amount. SMUD also makes partial contributions required of SMUD employees on their behalf and for their account. At the PERS fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, SMUD’s required employer contribution rate for normal cost was 9.8% of payroll and the unfunded liability contribution was $22.4 million. During 2023, SMUD contributed $37.4 million to PERS (including SMUD’s contributions to cover required employee contributions), and SMUD employees paid $18.3 million for their share of the PERS contribution.

For the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2025, SMUD is required to contribute 9.6% and 9.5% of payroll for normal costs and $10.7 million for fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 for the unfunded liability contribution. There is no estimated employer contribution to the unfunded liability for fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. Assuming no amendments to the plan and no liability gains or losses (which can have a significant impact), PERS has projected that SMUD will be required to contribute 9.4% of payroll to the plan for normal costs and $15.7 million for the unfunded liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026, not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions. The amount SMUD is required to contribute to PERS is expected to increase in the future. The actual amount of such increases
<!-- Page 327 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

SMUD has the option to prepay an annual lump sum payment to PERS for the unfunded accrued liability portion only (not including SMUD contributions to cover required employee contributions). SMUD made an annual lump sum prepayment of $19.5 million, and also voluntarily made an additional payment of $47.3 million, for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. SMUD was not required to make an annual lump sum prepayment and, to date, has not voluntarily made additional payments for the unfunded accrued liability for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

While SMUD has some ability to adjust the retirement benefits provided to its employees, PERS determines the actuarial methods and assumptions used with respect to assets administered by PERS (including the SMUD plan assets) and makes the investment decisions with respect to such assets. For a description of such actuarial methods and assumptions (including the smoothing conventions used by PERS when setting employer contribution rates) and investments, see the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS (SMUD’s plan is part of the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund of PERS) available on its website at www.calpers.ca.gov. SMUD cannot guarantee the accuracy of such information and neither the comprehensive annual financial report of PERS nor any other information contained on the PERS website is incorporated by reference in or part of this Official Statement. Actuarial assessments are “forward-looking” information that reflect the judgment of the fiduciaries of the pension plans, and are based upon a variety of assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be inaccurate or be changed in the future. Actuarial assessments will change with the future experience of the pension plans.

GASB issued Statement No. 68 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions – An Amendment of GASB Statement No. 27” (“GASB No. 68”). The primary objective of GASB No. 68 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for pensions. Under GASB No. 68, SMUD is required to report the net pension asset or net pension liability (i.e., the difference between the total pension liability and the pension plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of investment gains and losses. GASB No. 68 separates financial reporting from funding requirements for pension plans. The pension liability as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 is $259.0 million and $235.5 million, respectively.

SMUD provides its employees with two cash deferred compensation plans: one pursuant to Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 401(k) (the “401(k) Plan”) and one pursuant to IRC Section 457 (the “457 Plan” and collectively, the “Plans”). The Plans are contributory plans in which SMUD’s employees contribute the funds. Each of SMUD’s eligible full-time or permanent part-time employees may participate in either or both Plans, and amounts contributed by employees are vested immediately. Such funds are held by a trustee in trust for the employees upon retirement from SMUD service and, accordingly, are not subject to the general claims of SMUD’s creditors. SMUD makes annual contributions to the 401(k) Plan on behalf of certain employees pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with both of its collective bargaining units. SMUD matches the non-represented employee contributions to the 401(k) Plan up to a set amount. SMUD also makes limited discretionary contributions to non-represented employees hired after January 1, 2013, which contributions fully vest after five years. Prior to 2022, SMUD did not match employee contributions, nor make contributions on behalf of its employees to the 457 Plan. Beginning in 2022, SMUD makes annual contributions to the 457 Plan on behalf of certain employees and matches employee contributions up to a set amount pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with one of its collective bargaining units. SMUD made contributions to both Plans of $6.9 million in 2023 and to the 401(k) Plan of $7.0 million in 2022. Participating employees made contributions into both Plans totaling $34.3 million in 2023 and $32.4 million in 2022.

# Other Post-Employment Benefits

SMUD provides post-employment healthcare benefits, in accordance with SMUD policy and negotiated agreements with employee representation groups in a single employer defined benefit plan, to all employees who retire from SMUD, and their dependents. SMUD also provides post-employment healthcare benefits to covered employees who are eligible for disability retirement. SMUD contributes the full cost of coverage for retirees hired before January 1, 1991, and a portion of the cost based on credited years of service for retirees hired after January 1, 1991. SMUD also contributes a portion of the costs of coverage for these retirees’ dependents. Retirees are required to contribute the portion that is not paid by SMUD. The benefits, benefit levels, retiree contributions and employer contributions are governed by SMUD and can be amended by SMUD through its personnel manual and union contracts.

SMUD’s post-employment health care benefits are funded through the PERS California Employers’ Retiree Benefit Trust (“CERBT”), an agent multiple-employer plan. The funding of a plan occurs when the following events take place: the employer makes payments of benefits directly to or on behalf of a retiree or beneficiary; the employer makes premium payments to an insurer; or the employer irrevocably transfers assets to a trust or other third party acting in the role of trustee, where the plan assets are dedicated to the sole purpose of the payments of the plan benefits, and creditors of the government do not have access to those assets.

SMUD has elected to contribute the normal costs to the CERBT but annually receive reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT. In 2024, SMUD’s contribution for the normal costs to CERBT is $10.6 million. In 2023, SMUD made a contribution to the CERBT for normal costs in the amount of $8.6 million. In 2022, SMUD decided to forgo making a contribution for the normal costs to the CERBT because there was a net OPEB asset as of December 31, 2021. SMUD made additional contributions to the trust. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD made healthcare benefit contributions by paying actual medical costs of $24.7 million and $24.5 million, respectively. During 2023 and 2022, SMUD received $24.4 million and $23.3 million, respectively, reimbursement for cash benefit payments from the CERBT.

At June 30, 2023 and 2022, SMUD estimated that the actuarially determined accumulated post-employment benefit obligation was approximately $403.6 and $381.7 million, respectively. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the plan was 92.3% and 97.9% funded, respectively.

SMUD’s actuary uses PERS economic and other assumptions as the basis for the calculation of the post-employment benefit obligation. The actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will vary substantially if such PERS assumptions, such as interest rate and life expectancy, among others, prove to be inaccurate or different than SMUD’s actual experience. Although SMUD believes that such assumptions and estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that any such assumptions will prove to be accurate, or that SMUD’s actual accumulated post-employment benefit obligation will not materially exceed its estimates. Additional information is available in Note 15 (Other Postemployment Benefits) and “Required Supplementary Information” to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

GASB previously issued SGAS No. 75 “Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other than Pensions”. The primary objective of GASB No. 75 is to improve accounting and financial reporting by state and local governments for post-employment benefits other than pensions (“OPEB”). Under GASB No. 75, SMUD is required to report the net OPEB asset or net OPEB liability (i.e., the difference between the total OPEB liability and the OPEB plan’s net position or market value of assets) in its Statement of Net Position. This standard requires shorter amortization periods for recognition of non-investment gains and losses and actuarial assumption changes, as well as for recognition of

**Outstanding Indebtedness**

**General.** SMUD typically finances its capital requirements through the sale of revenue bonds, the sale of commercial paper, from draws on its Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and from internally generated funds. With the enactment of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and the 2024 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, SMUD is monitoring and exploring new methods of financing, including those afforded under these two federal laws, that provide not-for-profit public power utilities with direct federal incentive payments.

SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Senior Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 (the “Senior Resolution”) adopted in 1971, as amended and supplemented (the “Senior Resolution”). As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Senior Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $1,783,965,000 outstanding. The Senior Bonds are payable solely from the Net Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Senior Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of “Maintenance and Operation Costs” and “Energy Payments” as defined in the Senior Resolution, including payments by SMUD to TANC under PA3, payments by SMUD under power purchase agreements related to the Authorities and payments by SMUD to NCGA and NCEA under their respective gas supply contracts. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD’s Subordinated Electric Revenue Bonds (the “Subordinated Bonds”) are issued pursuant to Resolution No. 85-11-1 of SMUD, adopted on November 7, 1985, as amended and supplemented (the Subordinated Bonds).
<!-- Page 330 -->
![Subordinate Resolution](https://example.com/image.png)

**Subordinate Resolution**  
As of December 31, 2023, SMUD had Subordinated Bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $332,020,000 outstanding. The Subordinated Bonds are payable solely from the Net Subordinated Revenues of SMUD’s Electric System. The Subordinated Bonds are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds.

SMUD issues commercial paper notes (the “Notes”) from time to time. As of March 21, 2024, SMUD’s Notes were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $150,000,000. Currently, Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400,000,000 may be outstanding at any one time, but SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that may be outstanding at any one time in the future. The Notes are secured by letters of credit issued by commercial banks. The Notes (and SMUD’s obligations to repay drawings under the letters of credit) are payable solely from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. Drawings under the letters of credit, to the extent not repaid immediately from the proceeds of commercial paper or other available SMUD funds, are repayable with interest over a period of five years. The letters of credit currently expire in August of 2025 and March of 2027. [Reference to 2024 Senior Bond plan of finance to come]

SMUD also entered into a revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank and issued its taxable and tax-exempt revolving notes thereunder (collectively, the “Revolving Credit Facility”) in February 2022. As of December 31, 2023, no principal amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. Currently, the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility at any one time is limited to $100,000,000. However, SMUD reserves the right to increase or decrease the aggregate principal amount that can be outstanding at any one time under the Revolving Credit Facility from available revenues of SMUD’s Electric System and are subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment of principal of, premium if any, and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds. The current term of the Revolving Credit Facility expires in February 2026.

**Joint Powers Authorities.** SMUD has entered into long-term take-or-pay purchase agreements with SFA relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Under such agreements, SMUD has exclusive control of the dispatch of all five of the Local Gas-Fired Plants and takes all of the power produced by the Local Gas-Fired Plants. See “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Power Generation Facilities – Local Gas-Fired Plants.” The Authorities are each treated as component units of SMUD for accounting purposes. Only SFA has outstanding debt, which relates solely to the Cosumnes Power Plant and is payable solely from capacity payments made by SMUD under the related power purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2023, bonds issued by SFA to finance the Cosumnes Power Plant were outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $87,890,000. SMUD’s payments under the power purchase agreements relating to the Local Gas-Fired Plants are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal of and interest on the Senior Bonds and Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and Subordinate Resolution.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCGA as a joint powers authority. NCGA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCGA issued $757,055,000 in bonds in May 2007 for the purpose of paying Morgan Stanley Capital Group in advance for natural gas to be delivered to NCGA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas supplies delivered by NCGA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the Subordinate Resolution.

![NCGA bonds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=NCGA+bonds)

NCGA bonds. As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $120,070,000 remain outstanding.

SMUD and Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority formed NCEA as a joint powers authority. NCEA is treated as a component unit of SMUD for accounting purposes. NCEA issued $539,615,000 in bonds in December 2018 for the purpose of paying J. Aron & Company LLC in advance for natural gas or electricity to be delivered to NCEA and then sold to SMUD pursuant to a long-term purchase contract. SMUD’s obligation under the purchase contract is limited to payment for gas or electricity supplies delivered by NCEA. SMUD’s payments under the purchase contract are payable from revenues of SMUD’s Electric System prior to the payment of principal and interest on the Senior Bonds and the Subordinated Bonds as either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution. SMUD is not obligated to make any payments in respect of debt service on the NCEA bonds. [As of December 31, 2023, related bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $537,295,000 remain outstanding. As described in the forepart of this Official Statement, the bonds issued by NCEA in 2018 are expected to be refunded with proceeds of the Bonds (as defined in the forepart of this Official Statement.)] [to be revised for 2024 Senior Bond offering documents]

**Interest Rate Swap Agreements.** SMUD has two interest rate swap agreements relating to previously or currently outstanding Subordinated Bonds, as shown in the following table. For more information, see Note 9 (Derivative Financial Instruments) to SMUD’s consolidated financial statements.

| Effective Date | Termination Date | SMUD Pays | SMUD Receives | Notional Amount (000's) | Counterparty |
|----------------|------------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 7/2/1997       | 7/1/2024         | Floating  | SIFMA          | 5.154%                  | $19,570      | J Aron & Company LLC |
| 07/12/2023     | 08/15/2041       | Fixed     | 0.718%         | [70% of 1M SOFR]       | 132,020      | Barclays Bank |

The obligations of SMUD under the swap agreements are not secured by a pledge of revenues of SMUD’s electric system or any other property of SMUD. SMUD does not currently have any collateral posting requirements with respect to the interest rate swap agreements, but SMUD may be required to post collateral under certain circumstances.

**Build America Bonds Subsidy Payments.** SMUD’s Electric Revenue Bonds, 2009 Series V (the “2009 Series V Bonds”) and Electric Revenue Bonds, 2010 Series W (the “2010 Series W Bonds”) were issued as “Build America Bonds” under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. At the time the 2009 Series V Bonds and 2010 Series W Bonds were issued, SMUD expected to receive an annual cash subsidy payment from the United States Treasury equal to 35% of the interest payable on the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. However, as a result of the federal budget process, many payments from the federal government, including Build America Bonds subsidy payments, have been reduced. Absent the federal budget reductions, the aggregate annual cash subsidy payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds would be approximately $9.8 million. With the current federal budget reductions, SMUD has typically been receiving aggregate annual cash subsidy payments with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds of approximately $9.2 million. It is possible that future federal budget actions could further reduce, or eliminate entirely, the annual cash subsidy payments with respect to Build America Bonds, including the annual cash subsidy payments payable to SMUD with respect to the 2009 Series V Bonds and the 2010 Series W Bonds. SMUD cannot predict the likelihood of the further reduction or elimination of the Build America Bonds subsidy payments. A significant reduction or elimination of the cash subsidy.

(1) Does not include outstanding bonds issued by the Authorities for the Local Gas-Fired Plants. Does not include bonds issued by NCGA, NCEA or SMUD’s portion of bonds issued by TANC. Payments by SMUD which are used by the Authorities, NCGA, NCEA, and TANC to pay debt service on such bonds constitute either “Maintenance and Operation Costs” or “Energy Payments” under the Senior Resolution and the Subordinate Resolution.  
(2) Debt service is not reduced by the amount of any subsidy that SMUD currently expects to receive in connection with the 2009 Series V Bonds and 2010 Series W Bonds.

# INSURANCE

SMUD maintains a comprehensive property/casualty insurance program designed to protect against catastrophic losses that would have an adverse effect on its financial position or operational capabilities. Insurance programs are continuously reviewed and modified when construction, operational exposures, or developments in the insurance industry so warrant. Long-term relationships with a variety of insurers minimize SMUD’s susceptibility to the effects of market cycles. SMUD budgets reserves to meet potential insurance deductibles and self-insured liability claims.

SMUD safeguards assets with all-risk property and boiler/machinery insurance with limits of $800 million per occurrence for physical damage and business interruption combined. Various coverage sublimits and deductibles apply to losses arising from certain perils, such as business interruption, earthquake, or flood, respectively. Liability insurance is in effect to defend and indemnify SMUD against third party claims, including general, automobile and sudden and accidental pollution claims with policy limits of $140 million, and wildfire coverage with policy limits of $275 million, all of which include a variety of self-insured retentions.

Nuclear property and liability insurance policies are maintained in accordance with the NRC’s requirements for decommissioned nuclear plants that maintain dry storage of spent fuel on-site. This includes $100 million in first party property damage and decontamination, $100 million for nuclear liability arising from accidents on-site, $200 million for supplier’s and transporter’s nuclear liability, and $300 million for nuclear worker liability. SMUD is exposed to possible retrospective assessments for nuclear property events occurring at other nuclear facilities in the United States capped at ten times SMUD’s annual nuclear property premium (currently the maximum retrospective assessment is approximately $1,000,000).

Other types of insurance include non-owned aircraft liability, workers’ compensation, crime, cyber security, fidelity, fiduciary liability, directors’ and officers’ liability, professional errors and omissions, transportation, and builder’s risk for major facilities under construction.

# LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

SMUD is a party to numerous actions arising out of the conduct of its business and affairs, some of which are discussed below. SMUD believes that any losses or adverse financial results it may suffer in these current actions, to the extent not covered by insurance, would not, in the aggregate, have an adverse material impact on SMUD, its business and affairs, or results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

## Environmental Litigation

SMUD was one of many potentially responsible parties that had been named in a number of actions relating to environmental claims and/or complaints. SMUD has resolved these environmental claims and/or complaints and entered into settlement agreements and/or consent orders. These settlement agreements and consent orders have statutory reopener provisions which allow regulatory agencies to seek additional funds for environmental remediation under certain limited circumstances. While SMUD believes it is unlikely that any of the prior settlements or consent orders will be reopened, the possibility exists. If any of the settlements or consent orders were to be reopened, SMUD believes that the outcome will not have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

## Proposition 26 Lawsuit

In October 2019, two SMUD customers jointly filed a complaint against SMUD (subsequently one of the customers removed themselves from the complaint), which stated that SMUD’s Board violated

A-60
<!-- Page 334 -->
![Proposition 26](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Proposition+26)

**Proposition 26** (see “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY MARKETS – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Proposition 26” for a description of Proposition 26) when on June 24, 2019, it adopted rate increases for 2020 and 2021. The plaintiff contended the rates did not reflect SMUD’s reasonable cost of service because they included a 9.2% scalar that SMUD applies to its TOD residential rate restructure adopted by SMUD’s Board in the 2017 rate process. SMUD viewed the lawsuit as having little merit and while SMUD anticipated the court would rule in SMUD’s favor on substantive grounds, the plaintiff in early 2024 agreed to dismiss the lawsuit with prejudice due to their failure to diligently prosecute the case. On January 16, 2024, the court approved the dismissal.

On January 19, 2024, the same plaintiff, along with a second SMUD residential customer, jointly filed a new complaint challenging the September 21, 2023, SMUD Board adoption of 2024 and 2025 rate increases. The plaintiffs make a similar claim regarding the TOD scalar as the prior lawsuit. Given the little merit behind the lawsuit, SMUD believes the court will rule in its favor. However, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the case or, if to the extent SMUD ultimately is not successful in the litigation, what remedies against SMUD may be available. SMUD believes that if it is not successful in the litigation, and to the extent the outcome would have a material adverse impact on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations, the Board would make appropriate rate modifications based on an evidentiary record consistent with guidance from a judicial decision in the case.

**Other Litigation Matters**

Currently, SMUD is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints relating to its operations, including, but not limited to, property damage, personal injury, contract disputes, and employment matters. SMUD believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

**FERC Administrative Proceedings**

SMUD is involved in a number of FERC administrative proceedings related to the operation of wholesale energy markets, regional transmission planning, gas transportation and NERC reliability standards. These proceedings generally fall into the following categories: (i) filings initiated by the CAISO (or other market participants) to adopt/modify the CAISO Tariff and/or establish market design and behavior rules; (ii) filings initiated by existing transmission owners (i.e., PG&E and the other IOUs) to pass-through costs to their existing wholesale transmission customers; (iii) filings initiated by FERC to market participants to establish market design and behavior rules or investigate market behavior by certain market participants; (iv) filings initiated by transmission owners under their transmission owner tariffs to establish a regional transmission planning process; (v) filings initiated by providers of firm gas transportation services under the Natural Gas Act; and (vi) filings initiated by NERC to develop reliability standards applicable to owners, users, and operators of the bulk electric system. In addition, SMUD is an active participant in other FERC administrative proceedings, including those related to reliability, variable resource integration and the changing resource mix, and transmission planning and cost allocation. SMUD believes that determinations of these FERC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

**CPUC Administrative Proceedings**

Periodically, PG&E seeks to update its gas transmission and storage (“GT&S”) revenue requirements and rate designs. These applications are litigated at the CPUC and affect SMUD through several tariff rates SMUD pays to move natural gas along PG&E’s backbone transmission lines. In the 2019 GT&S rate case (the “2019 GT&S Case”), the CPUC affirmed the application in GT&S rates of cost causation principles to prevent excessive and unreasonable costs being shifted to electric generator.

backbone customers like SMUD, either through proposed changes in PG&E’s natural gas storage strategy or through cost shifts within the electric generator customer class.

PG&E filed its 2023 General Rate Case (the “GRC”) in June 2021 which includes its gas transmission and storage revenue requirements. In September 2021, PG&E filed an application for approval of its Gas Cost Allocation and Rate Design Proposals (“CARD”). The CPUC issued a decision in the GRC in November 2023 authorizing PG&E’s revenue requirements for the four-year rate period of 2023-2026. SMUD is a party to the comprehensive all-party settlement agreement submitted to the CPUC for approval in June 2023 which, if approved, would resolve all open issues in the CARD proceeding. SMUD does not believe that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations. SMUD will continue to actively participate in PG&E’s GRC and CARD proceedings to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to non-core customers, including electric generator backbone customers.

In the GRC, the CPUC directed PG&E to submit an application to revise its natural gas curtailment procedures “similar to the curtailment procedures of other large energy utilities”. SMUD will actively participate in this future proceeding.

Separately, SMUD continues to participate and monitor a proceeding at the CPUC concerning long-term gas system planning. At this point in these proceedings, SMUD does not anticipate that the resolution of such cases will have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

SMUD monitors a number of other CPUC proceedings. These proceedings generally fall into three categories: (i) filings initiated by PG&E to adopt/modify its tariffs and/or rules; (ii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish market design and behavior rules or program rules affecting SMUD customers; and (iii) rulemakings initiated by the CPUC to establish electric and/or gas system safety design and maintenance rules. SMUD believes that determinations of these CPUC proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR

California Electric Market

In 1996, the State partially deregulated its electric energy market and the CAISO was established in 1998. Since the CAISO’s formation, the State has experienced episodes of higher and more volatile prices for natural gas and wholesale electricity. In reaction to such conditions, SMUD made significant changes to its business strategy to mitigate the impacts of the more volatile and unpredictable energy markets. Volatility in energy prices in the State are always a potential risk due to a variety of factors which affect both the supply and demand for electricity in the western United States. These factors include, but are not limited to, the implementation of the CAISO market design changes, insufficient generation resources, the increase in intermittent renewable energy resources, natural gas price volatility, fuel costs and availability, weather and natural disasters, transmission constraints and levels of hydroelectric generation within the region. While SMUD has taken a number of steps to mitigate its exposure to price volatility associated with these factors, this price volatility under extreme conditions may contribute to greater volatility in SMUD’s net revenues from the purchase and sale of electric energy and, therefore, could materially adversely affect the financial condition and liquidity of SMUD. For a discussion of SMUD’s current resource planning activities and risk management strategies, see “BUSINESS STRATEGY” above.

# Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity continues to be a top priority for SMUD. Attacks or threats directed at critical electric or energy sector operations could damage or cause the shut-down of generation, transmission or distribution assets that are essential to SMUD’s ability to serve its customers, cause operational malfunctions and outages affecting SMUD’s electric system, and result in costly recovery and remediation efforts. The costs of security measures or of remedying breaches could be material.

SMUD participates in sharing and receiving information about cyber security threats in real-time through the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center (“E-ISAC”), the central hub for such data to actively manage risk related to potential cyber intrusion. SMUD also participates in NERC’s development of mandatory, enforceable cyber security standards to address vulnerabilities in electric utility systems. SMUD also adopts voluntary measures suggested as best practices by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) in its national framework.

SMUD’s prudent response to this ever-changing threat requires constant monitoring and frequent updates to implement new regulatory requirements as they are developed. SMUD manages risk related to frequently changing regulatory requirements by participating in the development of standards at NERC and NIST and through active engagement in the cyber security policy dialogue in Congress.

# Physical Security

Physical security is a critical concern for electric utilities as they seek to protect their infrastructure from a range of threats. The electric utility infrastructure is complex and consists of multiple components, such as power plants, substations, transmission and distribution lines, and other facilities. SMUD employs a dedicated physical security team that is deployed 24/7 and allows SMUD to respond to emergent events in a safe, coordinated, efficient, and cohesive manner, protecting the lives of its employees, customers, community, properties and assets. SMUD has policies, processes and procedures in place that outline the access controls and restrictions for its properties. SMUD restricts access based on need as it determines, while adhering to applicable laws, regulations and standards such as NERC Reliability Standards and NRC regulations. SMUD also maintains a Utility Security Plan adopted by the Board representing SMUD’s compliance with the CPUC’s Safety and Enforcement Division six-step security plan process described in CPUC Decision 19-01-018.

During times of elevated, imminent threats, safety and/or security concerns, SMUD’s Security Operations team, under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer or delegate, reserves the right to deploy additional security measures, controls, and further restrict or limit access to its properties to increase its security posture.

SMUD operates a 24/7 security operations center which monitors and coordinates responses to situations reported by internal and external stakeholders, or which are detected by SMUD’s security technology. The technology includes access control, video surveillance, and various types of intrusion detection solutions. The security operations center is a central hub for initial contact for physical security calls from employees of suspicious events and initiates incident responses as needed.

# Federal Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings

## Energy Policy Act of 2005

On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “EPAct of 2005”) was signed into law. The law includes a number of energy-related provisions, including among other things limited FERC jurisdiction over interstate transmission assets of municipal utilities, cooperatives and federal utilities to order these entities to provide transmission services on rates and terms. 

A-63
<!-- Page 337 -->

**Federal Regulation of Transmission Access.** The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the “Energy Policy Act”) made fundamental changes in the federal regulation of the electric utility industry, particularly in the area of transmission access. The Energy Policy Act provided FERC with the authority to require a transmitting utility to provide transmission services at rates, charges, terms and conditions set by FERC. The purpose of these changes, in part, was to bring about increased competition in the electric utility industry. Under the Energy Policy Act, electric utilities owned by municipalities and other public agencies which own or operate electric power transmission facilities which are used for the sale of electric energy at wholesale are “transmitting utilities” subject to the requirements of the Energy Policy Act.

Since the Energy Policy Act, FERC has adopted a series of rules to implement competitive open access to transmission facilities and regional transmission planning. Order No. 888, issued in 1996, requires the provision of open access transmission services on a nondiscriminatory basis by all “jurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does not include municipal entities like SMUD) by requiring all such utilities to file OATTs. Order No. 888 also requires “nonjurisdictional utilities” (which, by definition, does include SMUD) that purchase transmission services from a jurisdictional utility under an open access tariff and that owns or controls transmission facilities to provide open access service to the jurisdictional utility under terms that are comparable to the service that the nonjurisdictional utility provides itself. Section 211A of the EPAct of 2005 authorizes, but does not require, FERC to direct transmission utilities to provide transmission services, including rates and terms and conditions, that are comparable to those under which the unregulated transmitting utility provides transmission services to itself that are not unduly discriminatory or preferential – often referred to as the reciprocity rule.

In Order 890, issued in 2007, FERC stated that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis and retain the current reciprocity provisions.

In 2011, FERC issued Order 1000, which among other things requires public utility (jurisdictional) transmission providers to participate in a regional transmission planning process that produces a regional transmission plan and that incorporates a regional and inter-regional cost allocation methodology. Similar to Order 890, FERC states that it will implement its authority under Section 211A on a case-by-case basis. However, in Order 1000, FERC appears to expand upon the current reciprocity provisions and states that it has the authority to allocate costs to beneficiaries of services provided by specific transmission facilities even in the absence of a contractual relationship between the owner of the transmission facilities and the identified beneficiary.

SMUD, individually, and through the Large Public Power Council (“LPPC”), appealed Order 1000, but in 2014 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the arguments raised on appeal, upholding the entirety of Order 1000.

The jurisdictional members of WestConnect filed their proposed regional planning process and cost allocation methodology through a series of compliance filings at FERC. FERC accepted binding cost allocation for jurisdictional transmission providers of WestConnect and mandated that non-jurisdictional transmission providers (such as SMUD) identified as beneficiaries of a project have the ability to not accept the cost allocation. WestConnect’s Order 1000 planning process began with the 2016-2017 planning cycle. 

A-64
<!-- Page 338 -->
However, in response to FERC’s WestConnect orders on compliance, El Paso Electric Company (“El Paso”), a jurisdictional transmission provider, petitioned to the Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. El Paso contends that FERC’s WestConnect orders violate Order 1000’s cost causation principle because WestConnect’s binding cost allocation applies only to the jurisdictional transmission providers and thus forces jurisdictional transmission providers to subsidize projects benefiting non-jurisdictional transmission providers that opt-out of projects. The non-jurisdictional transmission providers agreed on a settlement with the jurisdictional transmission providers to resolve the matters on appeal in the 5th Circuit, but FERC ultimately did not accept the settlement. On August 2, 2023, the court reversed FERC’s orders implementing Order No. 1000 for WestConnect concerning cost allocation of regional transmission projects to non-jurisdictional transmission providers. The court found that the WestConnect orders are incompatible with Order No. 1000’s application of the cost causation principle to address free ridership. There is uncertainty at this time on the future of WestConnect’s regional planning process. FERC has not yet acted on its own in light of the Fifth Circuit’s decision, and it is uncertain whether it will act while it is working on an updated transmission planning and cost allocation proposal that could change the Order 1000 process (as further discussed below regarding the April 21, 2022 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking). It is also uncertain if and/or the extent to which the jurisdictional transmission providers in WestConnect will file revisions to the regional transmission planning provisions in their OATTs. In the meantime, the WestConnect planning has continued under the existing framework and SMUD, along with the other non-jurisdictional transmission providers, continue to participate in the WestConnect process. SMUD’s longstanding objective is to comply with open access requirements necessary to achieve reciprocity, including through participation in a regional planning process while binding itself to mandatory cost allocation. Thus, SMUD has an interest in continuing to explore options for participation in a regional transmission planning process if the WestConnect rules are modified to permit SMUD to reasonably participate consistent with its business and jurisdictional interests.

SMUD is unable to predict at this time the full impact that Order 1000, or the 5th Circuit’s August decision, will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the WestConnect process generally. However, WestConnect has conducted multiple planning cycles under its Order 1000 planning process and has not identified any project eligible for cost allocation. SMUD will continue to take any action necessary, including withdrawing from a cost allocation determination or planning region, and engaging in FERC proceedings, to ensure that it is not required to pay for transmission costs in the absence of an agreement or service relationship.

On April 21, 2022, FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Building for the Future Through Electric Regional Transmission Planning and Cost Allocation and Generator Interconnection (the “NOPR”). The NOPR seeks input on proposals that would impact the Order 1000 planning and cost allocation process. SMUD has been engaged in the proceeding, providing input and helping draft comments with trade organizations, including LPPC. FERC has not issued any subsequent order. SMUD will continue to monitor and be engaged in any developments at FERC that impact the Order 1000 process and its regional transmission planning participation.

NERC Reliability Standards. The EPAct of 2005 required FERC to certify an electric reliability organization (“ERO”) to develop mandatory and enforceable reliability standards, subject to FERC review and approval. On February 3, 2006, FERC issued Order 672, which certified NERC as the ERO. Many reliability standards have since been approved by FERC, including those aimed at protecting the bulk electric system from physical and cyber threats.

The ERO or the regional entities, such as WECC, may enforce the reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight or FERC may independently enforce reliability standards. Potential monetary sanctions include fines of up to $1,544,521 per violation per day. Order 693 provides ERO and regional entities with 

A-65
<!-- Page 339 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the discretion necessary to assess penalties for such violations, while also having discretion to calculate a penalty without collecting the penalty if circumstances warrant.

**Anti-Market Manipulation Rules.** EPAct of 2005 gave FERC the authority to issue rules to prevent market manipulation in jurisdictional wholesale power and gas markets, and in jurisdictional transmission and transportation services. These anti-market manipulation rules apply to non-jurisdictional entities such as SMUD. Further, EPAct of 2005 provided FERC civil penalty authority, which the Commission has stated that it will exercise carefully by assuring that its market manipulation rules are clear.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions.** Since 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has taken steps to regulate GHG emissions from different sources, including from the electric sector.

In 2014, EPA issued a proposed rule under section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”) called the Clean Power Plan (the “CPP”) that projected power sector emissions reductions of 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed CPP would have established a rate-based emissions goal for each state, providing states the responsibility to develop a State Implementation Plan (“SIP”) describing how each will meet the goal assigned by EPA using the “Best System of Emissions Reduction” (“BSER”) established by EPA. The rule was finalized in October 2015.

In November 2015, 27 states and numerous corporations challenged the CPP in court, alleging that EPA had exceeded its authority under the CAA; however, before the issue could be decided by the court, the 2016 presidential election resulted in a change of administration. The new administration quickly moved for an abeyance (or stay) of the case for as long as the agency needed to review and withdraw the CPP. The U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP pending disposition in the D.C. Circuit and any subsequent review by the Supreme Court. In August 2018, EPA proceeded to withdraw the CPP and the D.C. Circuit ultimately dismissed the case on September 17, 2019. EPA proposed a different rule under the same provision of the CAA, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) rule, which would have established a BSER that only includes measures that can be undertaken at an individual power plant, rather than the broader suite of measures envisioned under the CPP. The ACE rule was challenged in court by environmental groups and states alleging that the revised rule inadequately responds to EPA’s responsibility to protect public health and welfare. SMUD joined in this litigation along with other challengers. The D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule on January 19, 2021, and remanded it to the EPA for review and revision, just days before a new presidential administration took office. Several states led by West Virginia and coal industry members appealed the decision.

In June 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in West Virginia v. EPA, striking down the CPP and foreclosing any future regulations of “significant political and economic significance” if Congress has not expressly authorized them. While the decision does not restrict EPA to only requiring measures “inside the fence line” at an individual power plant to control GHGs, it appears unlikely that the EPA will be able to require material reductions in GHGs to mitigate climate change through section 111(d) of the CAA.

Under the new presidential administration, in May 2023, the EPA issued a proposed rule under Section 111(d) of the CAA to reduce GHG emissions from existing and new power plants. The four-part proposed rule, **New Source Performance Standards for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From New, Modified, and Reconstructed Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Existing Fossil Fuel-Fired Electric Generating Units; and Repeal of the Affordable Clean Energy Rule**, would set both GHG emission standards for certain subcategories of new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants operating greater than 50% of the time and generating more than 300 MW per turbine. In the proposed rule, EPA determined the BSER is either deploying carbon capture and storage

technology to capture 90% of emissions or co-firing 96% hydrogen produced through a low-emission process (“low-GHG hydrogen”). If finalized, compliance is required by 2032. SMUD has filed comments as part of several trade groups and coalitions in response to the proposed rule. SMUD’s internal analysis shows the rule as proposed would not require changes at any of its currently-operating fossil-fueled power plants and therefore will not have a material impact on SMUD’s financial position, operations, or liquidity.

**Federal Communications Commission**

The 1978 Pole Attachment Act added section 224 to the Communications Act of 1934, authorizing the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to regulate attachments by cable television systems or providers of telecommunications service to utility poles, ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way. Under Section 224(a)(1), public power entities are exempt from FCC pole attachment regulations, as municipally-owned poles are already subject to local decision-making processes and governance. The municipal exemption from FCC pole attachment regulations was further codified through the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. However, over the past decade, this exemption has been continuously eroded.

Various actions by the FCC have limited the exemption in support of a “uniform policy for broadband access to privately-owned physical infrastructure.” Through four orders issued between 2017 and 2018, the FCC set strict time limits for the review of pole attachment applications and preempted state and local agreements on pole attachments. In 2020, in *City of Portland v. United States*, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the FCC’s Small Cell Order, which adopted new time limits for municipal utilities’ review of wireless infrastructure siting applications and preempted access for small cell installations. In November 2023, the FCC adopted its Fourth Report and Order, Declaratory Ruling, and Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which established new rules and the fast-track approval process for pole attachment applications, among other things. SMUD will monitor this proceeding for any potential impact to SMUD.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new FCC rulemakings will impact the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system.

**Federal Clean Energy Legislation.** SMUD actively participates in discussion at the federal level regarding legislation that would meaningfully impact SMUD’s existing GHG reduction strategies or impose new requirements for electric generators, including a proposed federal clean energy standard. In the 117th Congress, a clean electricity performance program was considered but ultimately lacked support to pass. Instead, Congress extended and expanded clean energy tax credits and created new grant and rebate programs to incentivize clean energy investments in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While it is possible that a future Congress may revisit the concept of a clean energy standard or other GHG reduction regime, it is possible that the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will diminish the likelihood of a new regulatory framework being enacted in the near future.

SMUD is unable to predict whether any new EPA rulemakings will be undertaken, and what the full impact of the reduction of fossil-based generation over time will have on the operations and finances of SMUD’s electric system or the electric utility industry generally.

**State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings**

A number of bills affecting the electric utility industry have been enacted by the State Legislature. In general, these bills provide for reduced GHG emission standards and greater investment in energy efficient and environmentally friendly generation alternatives through more stringent RPS. Additionally, ongoing regulatory proceedings address the implementation of these bills as well as water flow and quality.

![Greenhouse Gas Emissions Summary](https://example.com/image.png)

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
On September 27, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (“AB 32”). AB 32 requires the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) to adopt enforceable GHG emission limits and emission reduction measures in order to reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. In addition, AB 32 establishes a mandatory reporting program for all IOUs, local, publicly-owned electric utilities and other load-serving entities (electric utilities providing energy to end-use customers) (“LSEs”). The AB 32 reporting program allows CARB to adopt regulations using market-based compliance mechanisms such as a “cap-and-trade” system.

On December 16, 2010, CARB approved a resolution adopting cap-and-trade regulations for the State. The regulations became effective on January 1, 2012. As adopted, the cap-and-trade program covers sources accounting for 85% of the State’s GHG emissions, the largest program of its type in the United States. In November of 2012, CARB conducted its first allowance auction and auctions now occur on a quarterly schedule.

The cap-and-trade program introduced a hard emissions cap that declines over time on the combined electric utility and large industrial sectors, covering all sources emitting more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent greenhouse gases (“CO2e”) per year, and was subsequently expanded to cover distributors of transportation, natural gas, and other fossil fuels. The cap-and-trade program requires covered entities to retire compliance instruments (allowances and carbon offsets) for each metric ton of CO2e they emit. CARB has allocated allowances to LSEs to mitigate the compliance cost burden on ratepayers. The value of allowances must be used to benefit ratepayers and achieve GHG emission purposes (not exceeding 8% of a regulated entity’s compliance obligation through 2020, 4% from 2021 through 2025, and 6% from 2026 through 2030). Offsets must be obtained from certified projects in sectors that are not regulated under the cap-and-trade program and are subject to other restrictions.

The State's cap-and-trade program was briefly linked to companion program in the Canadian province of Ontario during 2018 but was de-linked following a political change. In 2021, the Washington state legislature passed a cap-and-trade bill, which is expected to interact with the State’s markets. Future potential near-term links to the CARB cap-and-trade program also include the states of Oregon, which has adopted a cap-and-trade program, and New Mexico, which is considering the adoption of a cap-and-trade program.

On October 7, 2015, SB 350 was enacted, containing aggressive goals for reducing carbon emissions by 2030, including raising the proportion of renewable energy to 50%, reducing the use of petroleum fuel in cars and trucks by up to 50%, and doubling the energy efficiency of existing buildings. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change” for additional information. In addition, SB 350 established requirements for larger POUs to adopt and file with the CEC Integrated Resource Plans (“IRPs”) by April 2019 that should planned procurement to achieve the 50% RPS and State GHG goals established by CARB. The CEC developed “guidelines” for these IRPs for POUs in 2017, updated them in 2018, and proposed additional updates in 2022. CARB established specific GHG target ranges for these IRPs in summer 2018, which were revised in 2023 following the adoption of CARB’s 2022 Scoping Plan. SMUD developed and adopted an IRP in 2018 through a comprehensive public process and filed the adopted IRP with the CEC in April 2019. SMUD adopted an updated IRP in June 2022 and filed the updated IRP with the CEC in September 2022, but the CEC has not yet completed its review of SMUD’s 2022 IRP. SMUD’s updated IRP plans for a greater than 92% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 relative to 1990 levels, which equals approximately

250,000 metric tons of GHG emissions in 2030. See “BUSINESS STRATEGY – Sustainable Power Supply and Transmission – Renewable Energy and Climate Change.”

On April 29, 2015, the Governor of the State signed Executive Order B-30-15, establishing a goal for the State to reduce GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2016, the State Legislature passed Senate Bill 32 (“SB 32”), which codified then-Governor Brown’s goal of reducing the State’s GHG emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. In 2017, the State Legislature passed Assembly Bill 398 (“AB 398”), explicitly authorizing the continuation of the cap-and-trade program, with designated changes, through 2030. Subsequently, CARB adopted an initial set of regulatory changes extending the cap-and-trade program, including establishing utility sector allowance allocations through 2030. In 2018, CARB completed a rulemaking to implement the cap-and-trade program changes designated by AB 398. These changes include development of a hard price ceiling for the cap-and-trade program and two price-containment points below that ceiling, in an attempt to ensure stable prices in the program. CARB adopted final regulations on December 13, 2018.

In addition, any new projects constructed in the State, including power plants, that may cause a significant adverse impact on the environment must be analyzed under CEQA. Some State agencies have begun using CEQA in novel ways to require mitigation of “significant” GHG emissions caused, either directly or indirectly, by a project. Pursuant to Senate Bill 97 passed in 2007, CARB will assist the Governor’s Office of Planning and Research in setting thresholds of significance under CEQA of GHG impacts from new projects. This is an area of State law that is evolving and unsettled in the courts. However, there is a risk that any project proponent of an electric system infrastructure project might have to mitigate such potential impacts to a level of less than significant.

On December 3, 2012, the Superior Court issued a ruling in California Redwood Forest Foundation v. San Diego Association of Governments (“SANDAG”), Case No. 2100-00101593, that sided with the State Attorney General and the other petitioners stating that SANDAG did not follow CEQA when it adopted a $257 billion regional transportation plan in 2011. The ruling expressly invalidated the certification of the Environmental Impact Report (“EIR”) on the grounds that the EIR should have analyzed the plan’s consistency with the governor’s policy goal to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050 as articulated in the 2005 Executive Order S-03-05. On November 24, 2014, the Fourth Appellate District upheld the trial court in a published decision, and SANDAG appealed to the State Supreme Court. On July 13, 2017, the Supreme Court reversed and held that SANDAG’s decision to not adopt the 2050 goal was not an abuse of discretion. Nevertheless, the Court articulated three clear principles for agencies to follow in their CEQA review of planning documents: 1) agencies must take seriously the significance of even small increases in GHG emissions; 2) they must consider science-based State policy guidance in their decision-making; and 3) they are required to use the best scientific information available to determine whether their planning decisions are consistent with the State’s goals. These principles will apply to SMUD in CEQA reviews of future projects.

On September 29, 2006, the Governor of the State signed into law Senate Bill 1368 (“SB 1368”), the GHG Emissions Performance Standard (“EPS”). SB 1368 limits long-term investments in baseload generation by the State’s utilities to power plants that meet an EPS jointly established by the CEC and the CPUC. The agencies have set the EPS at 1,100 pounds CO2 per MWh, which is roughly half of the CO2 emissions rate of a conventional coal-fired power plant. CEC regulations to implement the law for POUs were approved by the Office of Administrative Law on October 16, 2007.

SMUD’s primary supply and demand-side resources need to meet customers’ electric usage patterns over the next 10 years. Currently there is a ban in the State that prohibits the development of nuclear power plants until there is a permanent storage solution for spent fuel rods. With the effective ban on new coal power imports under SB 1368, natural gas-fired, combined cycle power plants would appear

A-69
<!-- Page 343 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to be the primary viable option for fossil fuel-based baseload power plant development absent the implementation of new technologies in connection with other resource options. The reliance on a single fuel source will continue to put pressure on the natural gas market in the United States. SMUD has in place a natural gas procurement plan to mitigate natural gas volatility, see “POWER SUPPLY AND TRANSMISSION – Fuel Supply” above.

On September 16, 2022, the Governor of the State signed into law SB 1020, which creates interim climate targets under which eligible renewable energy resources and zero-carbon resources must supply 90% of all retail sales of electricity to California end-use customers by December 31, 2035, and 95% by December 31, 2040. The bill also requires each State agency to ensure that zero carbon resources and eligible renewable energy resources supply 100% of electricity procured on its behalf by December 31, 2035. SMUD provides electricity to a number of State agency buildings and will work with State agencies to comply with this requirement.

On October 7, 2023, the Governor of the State signed into law AB 1305, which requires an entity that purchases or uses voluntary carbon offsets and makes claims regarding the achievement of net zero, or other similar claims, to disclose on their website specified information. Many stakeholder groups are raising questions on if this includes RECs. Clean-up legislation could follow. It is not clear at this time whether RECs are included.

Reliability. On June 30, 2022, the Governor signed the 2022-23 budget, along with a number of trailer bills, which provide implementing details on the budget line items. Included in AB 205, the energy trailer bill, are a number of reliability programs.

1. CEC Distributed Electricity Backup Assets Program to incentivize the construction of cleaner and more efficient distributed energy assets that would serve as on-call emergency supply or load reduction for the state’s electrical grid during extreme events. The CEC adopted program guidelines in October 2023 and issued the first solicitation in December 2023.

2. CEC Demand Side Grid Support Program to pay customers to reduce demand during stressed grid events. SMUD has actively engaged the CEC on the development and subsequent revision of program guidelines. The CEC is expected to revise the guidelines again for summer 2024.

3. DWR Strategic Reliability Reserve to secure resources for summer reliability or to preserve the option to extend the life of facilities that otherwise would retire, new temporary generators of more than five MW, new energy storage systems of at least 20 MW, generation facilities that use clean, zero-emission fuel technologies, or new zero-emission technologies that can be operational by December 31, 2026.

As a follow up to this legislation, the Governor signed into law AB 1373. The bill authorizes the CEC to annually assess a capacity payment on a POU within the CAISO balancing authority area during a month in which the POU fails to meet its minimum planning reserve margin. This does not include SMUD, who is within the BANC balancing authority area. SMUD is, however, required to submit to the CEC an assessment of whether it exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin and system resource adequacy requirements. This bill also allows the DWR, for certain types of long-development projects, to act as a central procurement entity. For POUs, participation in the DWR program would be optional.

Zero-Emission Fleet Mandates. CARB has adopted the Advanced Clean Fleets (“ACF”) regulation, requiring certain medium- and heavy-duty (“MHD”) vehicle fleets to transition to zero-emission vehicles through purchase requirements or fleet composition requirements, which took effect on November

A-70

1, 2023, and applies to all publicly owned MHD fleets, larger commercially owned MHD fleets, and drayage trucks. Under the ACF Rule, public fleets like SMUD have two compliance options. The first is a zero-emission vehicle (“ZEV”) purchase requirement, under which 50% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2024, and 100% of annual MHD vehicle purchases would need to be ZEVs starting January 1, 2027. The second is an optional ZEV milestone option, under which the composition of the MHD fleet would need to meet certain ZEV percentages starting in 2025, with the entire fleet transitioned no later than 2042. The individual milestones depend on the number and category of vehicles in the fleet. Public fleets may opt into the ZEV milestone option until January 1, 2030. In 2024, SMUD plans to comply with the purchase requirement option, meaning that 50% of the MHD vehicles purchased in 2024 will be ZEVs. SMUD plans to monitor ZEV market developments and currently expects to opt into the ZEV milestone option as more ZEVs become available. The ACF Rule also accelerates a manufacturer ZEV sales requirement to 100% of all MHD truck sales by the 2036 model year.

CARB proposed the Zero-Emission Forklift regulation in November 2023. The regulation would require forklift fleets to transition spark-ignited forklifts to zero-emission technology starting in 2026. The regulation would apply to SMUD, as a forklift operator. Since SMUD has a limited number of forklifts, this regulation is not expected to have a material effect on SMUD’s financial position, liquidity, or results of operation.

Transportation and Building Electrification. In recent years, the State has identified transportation and building electrification as key strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality, and is advancing policy to support or accelerate electrification. For example, in addition to the zero-emission fleet mandates and LCFS regulation discussed herein, CARB adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II and Advanced Clean Trucks regulations to require vehicle manufacturers to increase sales of zero-emission vehicles, respectively. The CEC’s Building Energy Efficiency Standards are also encouraging the use of electric heat pumps in new homes and certain non-residential buildings across the state. The draft 2025 Energy Standards, which are expected to be proposed by April 2024 and adopted by August 2024, would establish prescriptive heat pump requirements for both space and water heating in new homes, and may require existing homes to install a heat pump when replacing an air conditioner. The 2025 Energy Standards, if approved, would take effect on January 1, 2025. In addition, the State has also provided funding for programs to encourage clean transportation and building electrification.

Increases in transportation and building electrification will result in increased customer usage of electricity.

Renewables Portfolio Standard. Senate Bill 100 was passed by the Legislature and approved by Governor Brown on September 10, 2018. Among other requirements, the bill sets a 50% RPS target for 2026 and sets compliance period targets at 44% by December 31, 2024, 52% by December 31, 2027, and 60% by December 31, 2030. The bill also creates a statewide planning goal to meet all of the state’s retail electricity supply with a mix of RPS-eligible and zero-carbon resources by December 31, 2045.

Sacramento-San Joaquin River Bay-Delta Processes. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is an expansive inland estuary, formed at the western edge of the California Central Valley by the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers (“Delta”). There are two substantial Delta planning processes with the potential to affect (1) energy available for SMUD’s purchase from the Central Valley Project (“CVP”) and (2) flows within the Upper American River watershed. These processes are called the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan (“Bay-Delta Plan”) and the Delta Conveyance Project.

The Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan is updated periodically by the State Water Resources Control Board (“SWRCB”), the last time being in 2006. The current Bay-Delta Plan update process is being implemented in four phases. The first phase considered southern Delta water quality, with a

**A-73**

**respect to fees and charges for general purposes, and a two-thirds voter approval requirement with respect to fees and charges for special purposes, unless the fees and charges are expressly excluded. The initiative, according to its supporters, is intended to prevent the circumvention of tax limitations imposed by the voters pursuant to Proposition 13, approved in 1978, and other measures through the use of non-tax fees and charges. Proposition 26 expressly excludes from its scope a charge imposed for a specific local government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable cost to the local government of providing the service or product. Proposition 26 is not retroactive as applied to local governments. Although SMUD believes that the initiative was not intended to apply to fees for utility services such as those charged by SMUD and its fees and charges meet the criteria of the exclusion described above, it is possible that Proposition 26 could be interpreted to further limit fees and charges for electric utility services and/or require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes. SMUD is unable to predict at this time how Proposition 26 will be interpreted by the courts or what its ultimate impact will be. As of the date of this Official Statement, SMUD is unaware of any fees or charges relating to SMUD’s service that would have to be reduced or eliminated because of Proposition 26. However, certain of SMUD’s adopted rate increases have been challenged. See “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS – Proposition 26 Lawsuit.”**

**Initiative 1935.** A voter initiative entitled “The Taxpayer Protection and Government Accountability Act” (“Initiative 1935”) has been determined to be eligible for the State’s November 2024 statewide general election and, unless withdrawn by its proponent prior to June 27, 2024, will be certified as qualified for the ballot in such election. Were it to be approved by a majority of voters in the election, Initiative 1935 would amend Article XIII C of the State Constitution to, among other things, provide that charges (or increases in charges) imposed or extended by a local government after January 1, 2022 for services or products provided directly to the payor (including, potentially, fees and charges for electric service or product) are “taxes” subject to voter approval unless the local government can provide convincing evidence that the charge is reasonable and does not exceed the “actual cost” of providing the service or product. Initiative 1935 defines “actual cost” as “(i) the minimum amount necessary to reimburse the government for the cost of providing the service or the product to the payor and (ii) where the amount charged is not used by the government for any purpose other than reimbursing that cost.” Initiative 1935 would also require that local governments impose fees and charges by ordinance (which may be subject to referendum). If adopted, Initiative 1935 would be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is unable to predict whether and how Initiative 1935, if approved, would be interpreted or applied, but it is possible any such interpretation or application could further limit future fees and charges or future increases in fees and charges for electric utility services, require stricter standards for the allocation of costs among customer classes and/or otherwise adversely impact SMUD and its revenues. In response to an emergency petition filed by Governor Gavin Newsom, with support from the League of California Cities and others, the California Supreme Court has unanimously agreed to decide whether the initiative should appear on the November 2024 ballot or be disqualified. A ruling is expected before June 30, 2024, which is the deadline for placing items on the November 2024 ballot. 

**On November 2, 2023, Assembly Constitutional Amendment No. 13 (“ACA 13”) was filed with the Secretary of State and will be on the ballot for the November 2024 statewide general election. If approved by voters, ACA 13 would require any initiative constitutional amendment appearing on the ballot on or after January 1, 2024, that would increase the voter approval requirement to adopt any State or local measure to be approved by the highest voter approval requirement that the initiative measure would impose. In other words, if ACA 13 is approved by voters, its express terms appear to require Initiative 1935 to pass with a 2/3 vote, since Initiative 1935 would extend a 2/3 voter requirement to additional State and local fees and charges. If adopted, ACA 13 and its effect on the adoption of Initiative 1935, if applicable, are likely to be subject to judicial interpretation. SMUD is not able to predict whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would be interpreted or applied or whether or how ACA 13, if approved, would affect the adoption, interpretation or application of Initiative 1935, if adopted.**

![Wildfire Legislation](https://example.com/image-url)

**Wildfire Legislation.** In response to catastrophic wildfires in California, legislation was adopted and signed into law requiring POUs (including SMUD), IOUs, and electrical cooperatives to construct, maintain and operate their electrical lines and equipment in a manner that will minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire posed by electrical lines and equipment. Senate Bill 247 (“SB 247”), signed by Governor Newsom on October 2, 2019, establishes notification, audit and reporting guidelines for electrical corporations relating to vegetation management requirements in the wildfire mitigation plan. SB 247 also specifies the qualifications for electrical line clearance tree trimmers performing work to comply with the vegetation management requirements in an electrical corporation’s wildfire mitigation plan and requires that qualified line clearance tree trimmers be paid no less than a specified prevailing wage rate. POUs are not required to adhere to SB 247, but the market impacts are projected to significantly increase SMUD’s annual vegetation management costs.

**Nonstock Security.** SMUD sponsored legislation in 2019, Assembly Bill 689, which was signed into law by Governor Newsom on September 5, 2019. This bill expressly allows SMUD the ability to operate a pilot project (effective January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2025), of up to three acquisitions, to hold nonstock security in a corporation or other private entity if acquired as part of a procurement of goods or services from that entity, provided that no separate funding is expended solely for the nonstock security. This will allow SMUD to realize the financial benefits of its investments, partnerships, and intellectual property.

On September 15, 2022, the Board authorized the CEO & GM to enter into a joint collaboration agreement with ESS Tech, Inc. (“ESS”). Under that agreement SMUD would procure from ESS in flow batteries for utility scale long-duration energy storage applications. The agreement contemplates a multi-year phased deployment of up to 200MW/2GWh of long duration energy storage by 2028. As part of this procurement, SMUD acquired nonstock security in ESS.

SMUD will be sponsoring legislation in 2024 to extend the authority granted by Assembly Bill 689 to future years.

**Future Regulation**

The electric industry is subject to continuing legislative and administrative reform. States and Federal entities routinely consider changes to the way in which they regulate the electric industry. Recently, both further deregulation and forms of additional regulation have been proposed for the industry, which has been highly regulated throughout its history. SMUD is unable to predict at this time the impact any such proposals will have on the operations and finances of SMUD or the electric utility industry generally.

**OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY INDUSTRY**

**CAISO Market Initiatives**

The CAISO routinely conducts a number of initiatives and stakeholder processes that propose certain operational and market changes that impact SMUD. SMUD does and will continue to monitor the various initiatives proposed by the CAISO and participate in its stakeholder processes to ensure that its interests are protected.

SMUD participates in the CAISO market for only a small percentage of energy needs, however, it continues to benefit from its participation in the CAISO’s WEIM and is currently exploring further participation in the CAISO’s proposed Extended Day Ahead Market (“EDAM”) (both the WEIM and EDAM are described further below). Along with monitoring other key market initiatives at the CAISO which impact wholesale energy markets, SMUD will continue to actively participate in all processes related

A-74
<!-- Page 348 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

to EIM and EDAM, to ensure both participation models are beneficial to SMUD’s customers. Given its success in EIM and active engagement with the CAISO and CAISO leadership, SMUD has earned a key role in the stakeholder processes related to these important and evolving markets.

**Resource Adequacy Filing**

In September 2005, the State Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Assembly Bill 380 (“AB 380”), which requires the CPUC to establish resource adequacy requirements for all LSEs within the CPUC’s jurisdiction. SMUD is not an LSE subject to the CPUC’s jurisdiction. In 2005, the CPUC issued a decision requiring jurisdictional LSEs to demonstrate that they have acquired capacity sufficient to serve their forecast retail customer load plus a minimum 15% planning reserve margin. In June 2022, the CPUC issued a decision increasing the minimum planning reserve margin to 16% for 2023 and 17% for 2024. In June 2023, the CPUC kept the minimum planning reserve margin at 17% for 2024 and extended the 17% requirement for 2025.

AB 380 also required publicly owned utilities, including SMUD, to meet the most recent resource adequacy standard as adopted by the WECC. The WECC has yet to formally adopt a resource adequacy requirement. However, consistent with current WECC practices, SMUD utilizes a minimum 15% planning reserve margin when assessing the need for future resources. For summer 2023, SMUD attained a 17% planning reserve margin and will have at least a 17% planning reserve margin for summer 2024 as well.

In 2022, the State Legislature adopted Assembly Bill 209 (2022) (“AB 209”), which requires the CEC to develop recommendations about approaches to determining an appropriate planning reserve margin for local publicly owned utilities within the CAISO balancing authority area. The CEC has initiated a proceeding and plans to publish a report with a recommended methodology on summer 2024. The report will not directly impact SMUD since SMUD is not in the CAISO; nevertheless, SMUD is monitoring the proceeding. The State Legislature also passed Assembly Bill 1373 (2023) (“AB 1373”) that requires the CEC to submit a report to the Legislature that assesses whether each local publicly owned electric utility in California (both inside and outside the CAISO) exceeded, met, or failed to meet its minimum planning reserve margin for 2023. The report must also assess whether local publicly owned utilities met the planning reserve margin for June through September 2023 established by the CPUC’s June 2022 decision (i.e., 16%). See also “DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR – State Legislation and Regulatory Proceedings – Reliability.”

While SMUD believes the CEC’s report will show SMUD met both its 15% planning reserve margin and the CPUC’s 16% planning reserve margin for 2023, SMUD is unable to predict the outcome of the report, or what the Legislature intends to do with the report. To the extent the CEC or Legislature imposes a higher POU planning reserve margin for future years that includes SMUD, the ultimate impacts on SMUD’s financial results and operations are difficult to predict and are dependent on a variety of factors, such as the relative cost of procuring energy/capacity, the availability and relative cost of new technologies, and the adoption and implementation of energy efficiency and other measures by SMUD’s customers; however, such impacts could be material.

**Western Energy Imbalance Market and Extended Day Ahead Market**

Federal and state policymakers have long-promoted the development of organized markets in the west as a means (among other reasons) to better integrate intermittent renewable resources into the electric system, the first of which markets is the Western EIM, operated by the CAISO. The CAISO successfully launched the WEIM, a real time only imbalance market, on October 1, 2014, with PacifiCorp as the first participant. Since this time, the WEIM has grown significantly with the addition of 21 other Balancing

to sell to nongovernmental entities electricity from generation projects and transmission service from transmission line projects financed with tax exempt obligations; (i) effects of inflation on the operating and maintenance costs of an electric utility and its facilities; (j) changes from projected future load requirements; (k) increases in costs and uncertain availability of capital; (l) issues relating to supply chains and the uncertain availability or increased costs of necessary materials; (m) shifts in the availability and relative costs of different fuels (including the cost of natural gas); (n) sudden and dramatic increases in the price of energy purchased on the open market that may occur at times of high peak demand in an area of the country experiencing such high peak demand, such as has occurred in the State; (o) issues relating to risk management procedures and practices with respect to, among other things, the purchase and sale of natural gas, energy and transmission capacity; (p) other legislative changes, voter initiatives, referenda and statewide propositions; (q) effects of changes in the economy; (r) effects of possible manipulation of the electric markets; (s) natural disasters or other physical calamities, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, droughts, severe weather, wildfires and floods; (t) changes to the climate, including increasing volatility in rainfall in the Western United States and a reduction in the depth and duration of the Sierra snowpack; (u) issues relating to cyber-security; and (v) outbreaks of infectious diseases or the occurrence of pandemics. Any of these factors (as well as other factors) could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of any given electric utility, including SMUD’s electric utility, and likely will affect individual utilities in different ways.

SMUD is unable to predict what impact such factors will have on the business operations and financial condition of SMUD’s electric system, but the impact could be significant. SMUD has taken major steps to mitigate the impacts of many of the changes. This Official Statement includes a brief discussion of certain of these factors. This discussion does not purport to be comprehensive or definitive, and matters are subject to change subsequent to the date hereof. Extensive information on the electric utility industry is available from the legislative and regulatory sources and other sources in the public domain, and potential purchasers of any of SMUD’s Senior Bonds or Subordinated Bonds described in the forepart of this Official Statement should obtain and review such information.

# APPENDIX C
## BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM

The information in this Appendix regarding DTC has been provided by DTC, and SMUD takes no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness thereof. SMUD cannot and does not give any assurances that DTC, DTC Participants or Indirect Participants will distribute the Beneficial Owners either (a) payments of interest or principal with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds or (b) certificates representing ownership interest in or other confirmation of ownership interest in the 2024 Series N Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis or that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this Official Statement.

The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the 2024 Series N Bonds. The 2024 Series N Bonds will be issued as fully registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully registered Bond certificate will be issued for each maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds, each in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC.

DTC, the world’s largest depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. DTC holds and operates servicing for over 3.5 instruments from over 100 countries that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others, such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.

Purchases of the 2024 Series N Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the 2024 Series N Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each 2024 Series N Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their beneficial ownership interests in the 2024 Series N Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the 2024 Series N Bonds is discontinued.

<!-- Page 353 -->
To facilitate subsequent transfers, all 2024 Series N Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of the 2024 Series N Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such 2024 Series N Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the bond documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of the 2024 Series N Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the 2024 Series N Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners.

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of a maturity of the 2024 Series N Bonds is being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in the 2024 Series N Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed.

Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant and in accordance with DTC’s Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to SMUD as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the 2024 Series N Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).

Principal, premium, redemption proceeds and interest payments on the 2024 Series N Bonds will be made to Cede & Co. or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts, upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from SMUD or the Trustee, on a

# APPENDIX D

## SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE RESOLUTION

The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Resolution. Other provisions of the Resolution are described under the captions “THE 2024 SERIES N BONDS” and “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS.” This summary is not to be considered a full statement of the terms of the Resolution and accordingly is qualified by reference thereto and is subject to the full text thereof. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this Official Statement shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

Between July 1997 and August 2003, SMUD received consents to amend the Resolution from the owners of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Bonds. Pursuant to the authority granted by such consents, SMUD amended the Resolution in October 2003 by adopting the Forty-Eighth Supplemental Resolution. The following summary of the Resolution reflects such amendments.

The purchasers of the 2024 Series N Bonds, by virtue of their purchase of the 2024 Series N Bonds, will consent to certain amendments to the Resolution (the “Proposed Amendments”). Such amendments are described in **bold italic** font in the forepart of this Official Statement under “SECURITY FOR THE BONDS – Rates and Charges” and “– Limitations on Additional Obligations Payable from Revenues” and in this summary of the Resolution under the captions “Certain Definitions” and “Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds.” The written consents to the Proposed Amendments of the holders and registered owners of at least 60% of the Bonds outstanding have been filed with SMUD or the Trustee, as required by the Resolution. However, while certain Bonds remain outstanding SMUD must also obtain the written consents of the holders and registered owners of the Proposed Amendments. SMUD expects to implement the Proposed Amendments when the written consents of such bond insurers are obtained or when the Bonds insured by such bond insurers are no longer outstanding. The final maturity date of the insured Bonds is July 1, 2024.

### Certain Definitions

“Assumed Interest Payments” means for any fiscal year or period interest which would accrue during such fiscal year or period on an amount equal to the then unamortized balance of the remaining sum of Assumed Principal Payments at the Assumed Interest Rate.

“Assumed Interest Rate” for any Parity Bond means an interest rate equal to the “Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index” most recently published in The Bond Buyer prior to the date of issuance of the Parity Bond to which the Assumed Interest Rate is applicable.

“Assumed Principal Payments” means for any fiscal year or period the sum of all amortized portions of each Excluded Principal Payment which fall within such fiscal year or period after the Excluded Principal Payments have been amortized (for purposes of this definition) equally over the years (pro rata in the case of a partial year) in the period commencing on the date of issuance of the Parity Bonds to which such Excluded Principal Payment relates and ending on the date which is 30 years from such date of issuance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Parity Bonds determined by SMUD to be an Excluded Principal Payment are refinanced with Parity Bonds determined by SMUD to be another Excluded Principal Payment, (1) Assumed Principal Payments with respect to the refinancing Parity Bonds shall not include any amount of principal which has previously been assumed amortized with respect to the refinanced Parity Bonds and (2) the period over which the refinancing Parity Bonds shall be assumed to be amortized shall be the period commencing on the date of issuance of the refinancing Parity Bonds and ending on the date which is 30 years from the date of issuance of the refinanced Parity Bonds.
<!-- Page 356 -->
**“Electric System”** means the entire electric system of SMUD, together with all additions, betterments, extensions and improvements.

**“Energy Payments”** means, when used with respect to the Electric System, all actual costs incurred, or charges made therefor, by SMUD in any particular fiscal year or period to which said term is applicable for purchased power (including power purchased from any special district included within the boundaries of SMUD), electric and thermal energy and capacity under contracts providing for payments by SMUD for electric or thermal energy or capacity whether or not such energy or capacity is delivered or capable of being delivered or otherwise made available to or received by or for the account of SMUD.

**“Excluded Principal Payments”** means each payment of principal on Parity Bonds which the Board of Directors of SMUD determines (on a date not later than the date of issuance of such Parity Bonds) that SMUD intends to refinance at or prior to the maturity date(s) of such Parity Bonds or otherwise to pay with moneys which are not Revenues. No such determination shall affect the security for such Parity Bonds or the obligation of SMUD to pay such payments from Revenues.

**“Financial Products Agreement”** means an interest rate swap, cap, collar, option, floor, forward or other hedging agreement, arrangement or security, however denominated, entered into by SMUD with a Qualified Provider not for investment purposes but with respect to specific Parity Bonds for the purpose of (1) reducing or otherwise managing SMUD’s risk of interest rate changes or (2) effectively converting SMUD’s interest rate exposure, in whole or in part, from a fixed rate exposure to a variable rate exposure, or from a variable rate exposure to a fixed rate exposure.

**“Financial Product Payments”** means amounts periodically required to be paid to a counterparty by SMUD pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement.

**“Financial Product Receipts”** means amounts periodically required to be paid to SMUD by a counterparty pursuant to a Financial Products Agreement.

**“Maintenance and Operation Costs”** means all actual maintenance and operation costs incurred by SMUD (including purchased power and fuel costs) or charges therefor made in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, exclusive in all cases of depreciation, or obsolescence charges or reserves therefor, amortization of intangibles or other entries of a similar nature, interest charges and charges for the payment of principal of SMUD debt.

**“Net Revenues”** for any fiscal period means the sum of (a) the Revenues for such fiscal period plus (b) the amounts, if any, withdrawn by SMUD from the Rate Stabilization Fund for treatment as Revenues for such fiscal period, less the sum of (c) all Maintenance and Operation Costs for such fiscal period, (d) all Energy Payments for such fiscal period not included in Maintenance and Operation Costs for such fiscal period, and (e) the amounts, if any, withdrawn by SMUD from Revenues for such fiscal period for deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund pursuant to the Resolution.

**“Qualified Provider”** means any financial institution or insurance company which is a party to a Financial Products Agreement if the unsecured long-term debt obligations of such financial institution or insurance company (or of the parent or a subsidiary of such financial institution or insurance company if such parent or subsidiary unconditionally guarantees the performance of such financial institution or insurance company under such Financial Products Agreement and the Trustee receives an opinion of
<!-- Page 357 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Rate Stabilization Fund** means the fund by that name established in the Resolution. From time to time, after provision for debt service, SMUD may deposit in the Rate Stabilization Fund from remaining Revenues such amounts as SMUD shall determine, provided that deposits may be made until (but not after) the date 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. SMUD may withdraw amounts from the Rate Stabilization Fund only for inclusion in Revenues for any fiscal year, such withdrawals to be made until (but not after) 120 days after the end of such fiscal year. All interest or other earnings on deposits in the Rate Stabilization Fund shall be withdrawn therefrom and accounted for as Revenues. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no deposit of Revenues to the Rate Stabilization Fund may be made to the extent such Revenues were included in an engineer’s certificate submitted in connection with the issuance of additional revenue bonds payable from Revenues and withdrawal of the Revenues to be deposited in the Rate Stabilization Fund from the Revenues employed in rendering said engineer’s certificate would have caused noncompliance with the provisions of the Resolution restricting issuance of additional obligations or securities payable from Revenues or to the extent any withdrawal of amounts from remaining Revenues for the Rate Stabilization Fund for any fiscal year would have reduced the debt service ratio referred to in this Appendix under the caption “Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds” to or below 1.40.

**Revenues** means all revenues derived by SMUD from the operation of the Electric System, or arising from the Electric System (consisting primarily of income derived from the sale or use of electric energy generated, transmitted or distributed by SMUD from the Electric System, but also including receipts from the sale of property pertaining to the Electric System or incidental to the operation of the Electric System or from services performed by SMUD in connection with the Electric System and revenues derived from certain wholesale, but not retail, sales of water), but exclusive in every case of any moneys derived from the levy or collection of taxes upon any taxable property in SMUD.

**Subsidy** means any subsidy, reimbursement or other payment from the federal government of the United States of America under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (or any similar legislation or regulation of the federal government of the United States of America or any other governmental entity or extension of any such legislation or regulation).

**Reserve Fund for Certain Bonds**

The Electric Revenue Bond Reserve Fund (the “Reserve Fund”) is created under the Resolution. The Reserve Fund secures all Bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 that are currently outstanding (and not otherwise deemed to be paid and discharged under the Resolution) and may secure additional Bonds issued in the future. However, the Reserve Fund does not secure and will not be available to pay debt service on the 2024 Series N Bonds.

After the close of each fiscal year, SMUD shall determine the ratio (herein called the “debt service ratio”) of (1) the Net Revenues during such fiscal year to (2) the maximum annual debt service during the period of three fiscal years next following said fiscal year on all Bonds and Parity Bonds then outstanding. For this purpose, the term “maximum annual debt service” shall mean the sum of (i) the interest falling due on serial bonds and term bonds, (ii) the principal amount of serial bonds falling due by
<!-- Page 358 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
their terms, and (iii) the amount of minimum sinking fund payments required, as computed for the year in which such sum shall be a maximum. Interest during construction which has been funded and provided for shall not be included in "minimum annual debt service" for the purpose of the above calculation.

So long as the debt service ratio shall exceed 1.40, the amount required to be maintained in the Reserve Fund shall be an amount such that the amount in the combined reserve funds of all Parity Bonds then outstanding will at no time be less than the current annual interest requirements on all then outstanding Parity Bonds, except only bonds (if any) for which payment has been provided in advance. If the debt service ratio in any fiscal year shall fall below 1.40, the Treasurer shall set aside in the Reserve Fund or in any other reserve fund or funds established for any one or more issues of the Parity Bonds (on or before the first day of each month of the next succeeding fiscal year) from the first available Net Revenues an amount not less than 15% of the sum of the current monthly interest requirements of all Parity Bonds then outstanding until the next year in which the debt service ratio shall exceed 1.40 or until the aggregate amount in the combined reserve funds established for all of the Parity Bonds (including the Reserve Fund) is equal to the maximum annual debt service on all of the Parity Bonds then outstanding, whichever shall first occur.

For purposes of the above calculation, the interest rates of Bonds which bear a variable rate of interest or a rate subject to periodic adjustment or to being fixed at some date after issuance shall be, if such Bonds bear a rate or rates of interest for a known period of periods of time, such interest rate or rates for such period or periods, and thereafter, for the portion of the calculation period covered by such known period or periods, the interest rate shall be the greater of the numerical maximum rate that such Bonds may vary or be adjusted to and the numerical maximum rate (if any) that the interest rate for such Bonds may be fixed to, in both cases as set forth in the supplemental resolution authorizing such Bonds, or if such rate or rates have been increased in accordance with such supplemental resolution at such increased rate or rates.

Any amount in the Reserve Fund at any time in excess of the balance required to be then maintained therein shall be released to SMUD for any SMUD use.

SMUD shall not be required, notwithstanding anything herein contained, to maintain in the combined reserve funds appertaining to all Parity Bonds of SMUD, an aggregate amount in excess of the maximum annual debt service requirements in any subsequent fiscal year on all of the then outstanding Parity Bonds.

Any moneys at any time in any of said reserve funds shall be held by the Treasurer in trust for the benefit of the holder or holders from time to time of the Bonds and the coupons appertaining thereto entitled to be paid therewith, and SMUD shall not have any beneficial right or interest in any such moneys.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Supplemental Resolution adopted after the Forty-Eighth Supplemental Resolution may provide that a Series of Bonds issued pursuant to such Supplemental Resolution shall not be secured by the Reserve Fund. In such event, (i) payments of the principal of and interest on such Bonds shall be excluded from all calculations made in respect of the amount to be maintained in the Reserve Fund and (ii) amounts on deposit in the Reserve Fund shall not be applied to the payment of the principal of or interest on such Bonds, even if no other moneys are available therefor.

![The 2024 Series N Bonds are not secured by the Reserve Fund.](https://example.com/image.png)

The 2024 Series N Bonds are not secured by the Reserve Fund.

In lieu of maintaining and depositing moneys in the Reserve Fund, SMUD may maintain and deposit in the Reserve Fund, for the sole benefit of the holders of Parity Bonds, a letter of credit (1) which is issued by a bank with a credit rating at the time of deposit of such letter of credit into the Reserve Fund within one of the top two rating categories (without regard to any refinement or graduation of such rating category by numerical modifier or otherwise) of Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard & Poor’s Rating Group, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (“S&P”), (2) the repayment obligation with respect to which is not secured by a lien on assets of SMUD senior to any lien which secures the Bondholders and (3) which has a term of at least 364 days from the date of issuance thereof. If the credit rating of the bank issuing such letter of credit falls below such top two rating categories, SMUD shall within twelve months of such downgrading either (a) substitute a new letter of credit satisfying the requirements of this paragraph, (b) fund the Reserve Fund through the deposit of cash or an irrevocable surety bond policy satisfying the requirements of the immediately succeeding paragraph or (c) fund the Reserve Fund through a combination of (a) and (b). At least 120 days prior to the expiration date of a letter of credit on deposit in the Reserve Fund, SMUD shall either (a) substitute a new letter of credit satisfying the requirements of this paragraph, (b) fund the Reserve Fund through the deposit of cash or (c) fund the Reserve Fund through a combination of (a) and (b). Any such letter of credit shall permit SMUD to draw amounts thereunder for deposit in the Reserve Fund which, together with any moneys on deposit in, or surety bond policy available to fund, the Reserve Fund, are not less than the amount required to then be maintained in the Reserve Fund (the “Reserve Fund Requirement”) and which may be applied to any purpose for which moneys in the Reserve Fund may be applied. SMUD shall make a drawing on such letter of credit and deposit the moneys obtained from drawing in the Reserve Fund (a) whenever moneys are required for the purposes for which Reserve Fund moneys may be applied, and (b) prior to any expiration or termination thereof; provided, however, that no such drawing need be made if other moneys or an irrevocable surety bond policy are available in the Reserve Fund in the amount of the Reserve Fund Requirement.

In lieu of maintaining and depositing moneys in the Reserve Fund, SMUD also may maintain and deposit in the Reserve Fund, for the sole benefit of the holders of the Bonds, an irrevocable surety bond policy (1) which is issued by a bond insurance company with a claims-paying ability rating at the time of deposit of such surety bond policy into the Reserve Fund within one of the top two rating categories (without regard to any refinement or graduation of such rating category by numerical modifier or otherwise) from Moody’s and S&P, (2) the repayment obligation with respect to which is not secured by a lien on assets of SMUD senior to any lien which secures the Bondholders and (3) has a term of at least 364 days from the date of issuance thereof. If the credit rating of the bond insurance company issuing such surety bond policy falls below such top two rating categories, SMUD shall, within twelve months of such downgrading, either (a) substitute a new surety bond policy satisfying the requirements of this paragraph, (b) fund the Reserve Fund through the deposit of cash or a letter of credit satisfying the requirements of the immediately preceding paragraph or (c) fund the Reserve Fund through a combination of (a) and (b). Any such surety bond policy shall permit SMUD to obtain amounts thereunder for deposit in the Reserve Fund, are not less than the Reserve Fund Requirement and which may be applied to any purpose for which moneys in the Reserve Fund may be applied. SMUD shall make a drawing on such surety bond policy and deposit the proceeds derived from such drawing in the Reserve Fund (a) whenever moneys are required for the purposes for which Reserve Fund moneys may be applied, and (b) prior to
<!-- Page 360 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  

any expiration or termination thereof; provided, however, that no such drawing need be made if other moneys or a letter of credit are available in the Reserve Fund in the amount of the Reserve Fund Requirement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the prior two paragraphs, if at any time that there is on deposit in the Reserve Fund a combination of cash, a letter of credit and/or a surety bond as contemplated above, SMUD shall draw first on such cash to the extent required and available, then on (1) such surety bond and letter of credit on a pro rata basis (if both a surety bond and letter of credit are available) to the extent required and available, or (2) such surety bond or letter of credit (if either a surety bond or letter of credit, but not both, is available) to the extent required and available.

For purposes of calculating the “debt service ratio” and, unless otherwise specified in a Supplemental Resolution providing for the issuance of a series of Parity Bonds, the amount required to be maintained in the Reserve Fund as described above: (1) any calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy that SMUD receives or expects to receive during such period of time relating to or in connection with such Parity Bonds; and (2) to the extent the calculation of principal of and interest on Parity Bonds is reduced by the Subsidy as provided in clause (1) of this paragraph, any calculation of Net Revenues for any period of time shall be reduced by the amount of any Subsidy received or expected to be received by SMUD with respect to or in connection with such Parity Bonds during such period of time.

### Additional Covenants

The Resolution contains the following additional covenants, among others:

1. That the Electric System will be maintained in good repair, working order and condition at all times, and will be continuously operated in an efficient and economical manner.

2. That no electric energy shall be supplied free by SMUD, and a reasonable wholesale charge will be made for water distributed at any cost to SMUD and such charge will be deemed Revenues; but SMUD may supply without charge water furnished to it without distribution cost, and any moneys received from any retail sales of water will not be deemed Revenues.

3. That all taxes and governmental charges and other lawful claims which might become a lien on the Electric System or the Revenues or impair the security of the Bonds will be paid and discharged when due.

4. That SMUD will comply with all lawful orders of any governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction in the premises (except while the validity or application thereof is being contested in good faith) and with all necessary permits and licenses issued by the NRC.

5. That no lease or agreement will be entered into, or sale or other disposition of essential property made, that would impair the operation of the Electric System or the rights of Bondholders with respect to the Revenues; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Master Resolution, SMUD may sell or otherwise dispose of its accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD provided that SMUD delivers to the Trustee:

   (a) a Certificate of SMUD to the effect that the amount derived by SMUD from the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances is a result of the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances upon fair and reasonable terms no
<!-- Page 361 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

less favorable to SMUD than the terms of a comparable arm’s-length transaction treated as a sale and not a loan under generally accepted accounting principles; and  
(b) a written statement or report of an independent certified public accountant to the effect that, based on the audited financial statements of SMUD for the most recent fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available and after giving effect to such transaction by reducing Revenues for such fiscal year by the difference between the face amount of such accounts receivable or loan balances and the amount derived by SMUD from the sale or other disposition of such accounts receivable or loan balances, the debt service ratio computed pursuant to the Master Resolution would not have been reduced to less than 1.40:1.0.

6. That proper records and accounts will be maintained of all transactions relating to the Electric System and the Revenues (open to inspection by the Trustee and the holders of not less than 10 percent in principal amount of the Bonds), to be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant within 90 days after close of the fiscal year, and copies of such financial statements supplied to Bondholders on request.

7. That insurance adequate in amounts and as to risks covered will be maintained against such risks as are usually insurable in connection with similar electric systems, and in addition public liability and property damage insurance in amounts not less than $1,000,000 per accident and adequate fidelity bonds on all officers and employees of SMUD handling or responsible for SMUD funds, subject in each case to the condition that such insurance is obtainable at reasonable rates and upon reasonable terms and conditions. See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION REGARDING SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT – INSURANCE” attached to this Official Statement for a description of SMUD’s insurance.

8. That the net proceeds realized by SMUD in the event all or any part of the Electric System is taken by eminent domain proceedings will be applied to the redemption or retirement of all Bonds and Parity Bonds if sufficient therefor, and, if not, then pro rata to the redemption or retirement of Bonds and Parity Bonds or to new facilities if the additional Revenues to be derived therefrom will sufficiently offset the loss of Revenues resulting from such eminent domain so that the ability of SMUD to meet its obligations will not be substantially impaired.

9. That SMUD will at all times use its best efforts to maintain the powers, functions and duties now reposed in it pursuant to law.

10. That SMUD will establish and at all times maintain and collect rates and charges for the sale or use of its electric energy sufficient to permit SMUD to purchase power or issue and sell Bonds or Parity Bonds to finance additions, betterments, extensions and improvements to the Electric System as may be reasonably necessary to satisfy its then projected electric demand upon its Electric System, and that unless the Board determines that SMUD will be able to satisfy such demand through the purchase of electric energy, SMUD will proceed with all reasonable diligence to issue and sell such Bonds or Parity Bonds.

11. That SMUD will not create, or permit the creation of, any mortgage or lien upon the Electric System or any property essential to the proper operation of the Electric System or to the maintenance of the Revenues. SMUD will not create, or permit the creation of, any pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon the Revenues except only as provided in the Master Resolution; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of the Master Resolution, SMUD may create a pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance upon its accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD (which pledge, lien, charge or encumbrance shall be prior to any pledge, lien, charge or
<!-- Page 362 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

encumbrance created or made pursuant to the Master Resolution, including without limitation the pledge of Revenues made pursuant to the Master Resolution) to secure indebtedness with a term of one year or less provided that the principal amount of such indebtedness does not exceed 50% of the aggregate face amount of the accounts receivable and customer loan balances due to SMUD as shown on SMUD’s most recent audited financial statements.

## Amendment of the Resolution

The Resolution and the rights and obligations of SMUD and of the holders of the Bonds may be modified or amended at any time pursuant to the affirmative vote at a meeting of Bondholders, or with the written consent without a meeting, of the holders of 60 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds then outstanding, provided that no such modification or amendment shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any Bond, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, without the consent of the holder of each Bond so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Bonds required for consent to an amendment or modification, without the consent of the holders of all the Bonds then outstanding. Modifications or amendments may be made, without the consent of any Bondholders, to add covenants of SMUD or to surrender rights reserved by SMUD in the Resolution, to cure ambiguities or defective or inconsistent provisions or in regard to questions arising under the Resolution without adversely affecting the interests of the Bondholders, or to provide for the issuance of a series of Bonds, subject to the provisions contained in the Resolution with respect thereto.

## Events of Default and Remedies of Bondholders

The Resolution declares each of the following to be an event of default:

(a) Failure to pay the principal of and premium on any Bond when due and payable;

(b) Failure to pay any installment of interest on any Bond when due and payable, if such default continues for a period of 30 days;

(c) Default by SMUD in the observance of any of the covenants, agreements or conditions on its part in the Resolution or in the Bonds, if such default continues for a period of 60 days after written notice thereof (specifying such default and requiring the same to be remedied) has been given to SMUD by the Trustee, or to SMUD and the Trustee by the holders of not less than 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time outstanding; and

(d) If, under the provisions of any law for the relief or aid of debtors, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume custody or control of SMUD or of the whole or any substantial part of its property, and such custody or control shall not be terminated or stayed within 60 days;

In the event of default, the Trustee or the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Bonds may, upon written notice to SMUD, declare the principal of all outstanding Bonds, and the interest accrued thereon, to be due and payable immediately. The Trustee is appointed as trustee to represent Bondholders and may take such action as may seem appropriate to it, and, upon the written request of the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Bonds, and upon being furnished with indemnity satisfactory to it, will take such action on behalf of Bondholders as is specified in such written request. Each Bondholder is entitled to proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in such holder by the Resolution by such appropriate judicial proceedings as such holder deems most effectual.
<!-- Page 363 -->
![Page 9](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Page+9)

The rights of Bondholders are limited and restricted to the use and application of Revenues as provided in the Resolution and do not extend to the levy of any attachment or execution upon or forfeiture of any of the properties of SMUD or to any moneys derived by SMUD from the levy or collection of taxes.

In addition to the limitations on remedies contained in the Resolution, the rights and remedies provided by the Bonds and the Resolution, as well as the enforcement by SMUD of contracts with customers of the Electric System, may be limited by and are subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights.

### Refunding of 2024 Series N Bonds
If Refunding Bonds are issued for the purpose of refunding 2024 Series N Bonds, then SMUD is authorized to apply proceeds of the sale of such Refunding Bonds to the payment of the purchase price of direct noncallable obligations of the United States of America (“Treasury Obligations”) to be held by the Trustee to insure the payment or retirement at or before maturity of all or a portion of the outstanding 2024 Series N Bonds. Upon deposit with the Trustee, in trust, of money or Treasury Obligations (including, but not limited to, direct obligations of the United States of America issued in book-entry form on the books of the Department of the Treasury of the United States of America), or any combination thereof, sufficient, together with the interest to accrue on any such Treasury Obligations, to pay or redeem all or a portion of 2024 Series N Bonds then outstanding at or before their maturity date, all liability of SMUD in respect of such 2024 Series N Bonds shall cease, determine and be completely discharged, and the holders thereof shall thereafter be entitled only to payment by SMUD of the money and Treasury Obligations deposited with the Trustee for their payment. If the liability of SMUD shall cease and determine with respect to all or a portion of the 2024 Series N Bonds, then said 2024 Series N Bonds shall not be considered to be outstanding Bonds for any purpose of the Resolution.

### Discharge of Resolution
The Resolution may be discharged by depositing with the Trustee in trust, moneys or Federal Securities or general obligation bonds of the State of California, in such amount as the Trustee shall determine will, together with the interest to accrue thereon, be fully sufficient to pay and discharge the indebtedness on all Bonds at or before their respective maturity dates.

### Investment of Funds
Moneys in any fund established by the Resolution may be invested in bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness, bills, bankers acceptances or other securities in which funds of SMUD may be legally invested as provided by the law in effect at the time of such investment. Currently this investment authority includes, among other things, the Local Agency Investment Fund which is administered by the Treasurer of the State of California for the investment of funds belonging to local agencies in the State of California.

Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2024 Series N  
(Final Opinion)  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) in connection with the issuance of $ __________ aggregate principal amount of Sacramento Municipal Utility District Electric Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2024 Series N (the “2024 Series N Bonds”), issued pursuant to Resolution No. 6649 of the Board of Directors of SMUD, adopted January 7, 1971 (the “Master Resolution”), as supplemented and amended by later resolutions of said Board of Directors (as so supplemented and amended, the “Resolution”), including Resolution No. 24-03-[__], adopted March 21, 2024 (the “Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution”). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Resolution.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Resolution; the Tax Certificate, dated the date hereof (the “Tax Certificate”), executed by SMUD; opinions of counsel to SMUD and the Trustee; certificates of SMUD, the Trustee and others; and such other documents, opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after original delivery of the 2024 Series N Bonds on the date hereof. We have not undertaken to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or any other matters come to our attention after original delivery of the 2024 Series N Bonds on the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its date and is not intended to, and may not be, relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such actions, events or matters. Our engagement with respect to the 2024 Series N Bonds has concluded with their issuance, and we disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the genuineness of all documents and signatures provided to us and the due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than SMUD. We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented, warranted or certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to in the second paragraph hereof. Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants and agreements contained in the Resolution and the Tax Certificate, including (without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance which is necessary to assure that future actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds to be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes.

We call attention to the fact that the rights and obligations under the 2024 Series N Bonds, the Resolution and the Tax Certificate and their enforceability may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to  
1

or affecting creditors’ rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against governmental entities such as SMUD in the State of California. We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty (including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state or quality of title to or interest in any of the property described in or as subject to the lien of the Resolution or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein, or the remedies available to enforce liens on any such property. Our services did not include financial or other non-legal advice. Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official Statement, dated ______, 2024, or other offering material relating to the 2024 Series N Bonds and express no opinion or view with respect thereto.

Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the following opinions:

1. The 2024 Series N Bonds constitute the valid and binding obligations of SMUD.

2. The Resolution, including the Sixty-Seventh Supplemental Resolution, has been duly adopted by, and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of, SMUD. The Resolution creates a valid pledge, to secure the payment of the principal of and interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds, of the Net Revenues, subject to the provisions of the Resolution permitting the application thereof for the purposes and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Resolution.

3. Interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual alternative minimum tax. We observe that interest on the 2024 Series N Bonds included in adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations is not excluded from the federal corporate alternative minimum tax. We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the 2024 Series N Bonds.

Faithfully yours,  
ORRICK, HERRINGTON & SUTCLIFFE LLP

**NARRATIVE**  

**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager, or his designee to approve the inclusion of SMUD’s disclosure information (Appendix A) in the Preliminary Official Statement pursuant to the commodity prepay transaction with the Northern California Energy Authority (NCEA) as the bond issuer and execute the Commodity Supply Agreement and any other related documents necessary to facilitate this transaction.  

**Summary:**  
SMUD entered into a 30 year commodity supply agreement with NCEA in 2018 for an initial 5-year term. NCEA is refunding and extending the original transaction to a new 6-8 year term which will allow SMUD to save as much as $3 million annually, depending on market conditions at pricing. The commodity supply agreement allows for maximum flexibility where SMUD can receive fuel, electricity, or novate an existing renewable power purchase agreement or novate a supply of biogas. It also provides SMUD the opportunity to switch to from natural gas to one of the other commodity types prior to 2029 if desired.  

Approval of SMUD’s disclosure information will allow NCEA to issue the bonds, and the Commodity Supply Agreement will allow SMUD to purchase natural gas or electricity at a discount, with J. Aron (Goldman Sachs) as the gas/electricity supplier.  

**Board Policy:**  
SD-2 Competitive Rates, SD-3 Access to Credit Markets  

**Benefits:**  
SMUD expects to purchase gas/electricity from NCEA at rates lower than index prices.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
All fees are expected to be paid by the transaction.  

**Alternatives:**  
Forgo the prepay transaction and associated savings.

### NARRATIVE:

**Requested Action:**  
Approve the issuance of Northern California Energy Authority (NCEA) Commodity Prepay Bonds and authorize the Chief Executive Officer & General Manager to execute documents necessary to complete the issuance of the bonds and various contracts related to the prepayment of the commodities.

**Summary:**  
NCEA issued 30 year commodity prepay bonds in 2018 for an initial 5-year term. NCEA is now refunding and extending the original transaction to a new 30 year term with an initial put bond with a five to eight year term. The refunding and extension will allow NCEA to pass on as much as $3 million savings annually to SMUD, depending on market conditions at pricing. The commodity prepay bonds allow for maximum flexibility where SMUD can receive fuel, electricity, or novate an existing renewable power purchase agreement or novate a supply of biogas. The maximum par value of the bonds/notes combined will be approximately $850 million, with a maximum coupon of 5%.

**Board Policy:**  
SD-2 Competitive Rates, SD-3 Access to Credit Markets  
**Benefits:**  
Bond proceeds will be used to prepay Goldman Sachs for delivery of commodities at a discount to index over a 30-year period.

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
Cost of issuance have been included in the 2024 budget and a portion of the costs will be paid out of bond proceeds and recovered over the life of the transaction.

**Alternatives:**  
Do not prepay for commodities and forgo annual savings.

Good Faith Estimate of Cost for the Bond Transaction  

**General Background Information**  
The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (“SMUD”) DBA as the Northern California Energy Authority intends to execute a bond transaction in the Spring of 2024, the Commodity Supply Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2024, subject to market conditions. The purpose of this transaction is to refund the Commodity Supply Revenue Bonds, Series 2018 of which $537.3 million remain outstanding. This transaction is a natural gas prepayment transaction with the 2018 Bonds having a mandatory purchase date of July 1, 2024. In addition to this refunding, NCEA has added additional gas volumes to the prepayment, increasing the amount of par issued with this transaction. Goldman Sachs is the sole senior manager for this transaction.  

Based on market conditions in the end of February, PFM believes the following information pertains to the underwriter's discount and cost of issuance for this planned transaction:

| **Total Underwriter's Discount** ¹                | **3,361,750**  |

| Other Compensation Received, Related Party         | Amount         |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Prepayment LLC Fee                                 | 9,800,000      |
| Fee for Natural Gas Delivery (per MMBtu)          | TBD            |
| **Additional Other Compensation**                  | **9,800,000**  |

| Cost of Issuance                                   | Amount         |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Total, day of delivery expenses                    | 1,250,000      |
| (includes Total Underwriter's Discount and Cost of Issuance and excludes related party compensation) | 4,611,750      |

¹ Underwriter's discount does not include additional compensation received by Goldman Sachs through related party transactions

PFM does note that there are other related party forms of compensation not technically characterized as "Underwriter's Discount", typical for Commodity Pre-pay transactions that incorporate a Limited Liability Corporation ("LLC"). Based on initial Goldman Sachs modeling and through other Goldman Sachs prepayments with a similar LLC structure, there is a fee, scalable to the final size of the transaction. It is expected that for NCEA, this will be ~$9.8 million that is incorporated into the prepayment cashflows. This amount largely reflects two items:
- An equity amount necessary to initially capitalize the LLC
- A "revenue offset" process at Goldman Sachs. Basically, the expected NCEA counterparty is a Goldman Sachs client that will not need to raise capital with their Goldman Sachs counterparty. Hence, this is a transfer to that profit center to make that side of Goldman Sachs whole through this prepay transaction.

Finally, there is another stream of related party revenue. J. Aron, a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, will receive revenues in the form of a "Reservation Charge / Administration Fee" for the coordination required for commodity delivery. This will likely be received for as long as J. Aron is involved in the transaction and is based on the quantity of the commodity received.

**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Approve amendments to the 2024 Northern California Energy Authority (NCEA) Budget Resolution to i) combine and relabel the Interest Expense and Bond Principal line items to the single line item Debt Service (Interest and Principal) and augment the line item by $12,983,277 and ii) augment the Administrative & General line item by $15,000,000.  

**Summary:**  
NCEA is a Joint Powers Authority (JPA), formed by SMUD and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District Financing Authority (SFA) in 2018. NCEA issued five-year put bonds and used the proceeds to enter into a commodity prepayment agreement with J Acron and Company for a 30-year supply of fuel or electricity, with a mandatory put date of July 1, 2024. NCEA has also entered into a Commodity Supply Contract with SMUD that provides for the sale of all the fuel or electricity to SMUD. In 2024, NCEA will use up to the augmented budget amount to remarket the bonds and extend the commodity supply agreement which requires augmenting the previously approved 2024 budget; the Administrative & General line item is conservatively high to account for uncertainty primarily due to changing market conditions, and the accounting rules might require the costs to be classified. The budget change is applicable only to NCEA, while SMUD’s budget is unaffected. SMUD’s 2024 Budget Commodity line item includes the cost of commodities to be purchased from NCEA. NCEA will use proceeds from the commodities sales to SMUD, combined with swap cash flow settlements, to pay for interest and principal on the NCEA bonds.  

**Board Policy (Number & Title):**  
Strategic Direction SD-2, Competitive Rates, Strategic Direction SD-3, Access to Credit Markets, Strategic Direction SD-4, Reliability.  
The NCEA budget will support SD-2, SD-3 and SD-4 by providing a reliable and discounted supply of fuel for SMUD’s thermal generating plants. The 2024 Budget provides for the payment of interest, principal, trustee fees on the NCEA bonds, bond issuance costs and other administrative costs.  

**Benefits:**  
Approval of the amendment to the 2024 NCEA Budget Resolution meets the requirements of the Municipal Utility District (MUD) Act and will authorize debt service, trustee fee and other administrative payments within the limits prescribed.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
Approval of the amendment to the 2024 NCEA Budget Resolution will authorize debt service and administrative payments within the limits prescribed.  

**Alternatives:**  
Approval of a budget is required before June 1, 2024, or NCEA will not have authority to carry out fuel transactions nor make required debt service payments.  

**Affected Parties:**  
Budget Office, Accounting, Treasury, Power Generation, Energy Trading & Contracts, Legal.
