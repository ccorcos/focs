**Proposed Revisions to Board-Staff Linkage BL-13**

SMUD’s participation in state and federal grants as a prime-recipient or sub-recipient provides a unique opportunity for SMUD to leverage state and federal funds to advance SMUD’s policies, conduct research and development projects, and provide benefits to the Sacramento community. SMUD’s grant participation shall further SMUD’s strategic directives, provide benefits to SMUD’s customers and the community, and shall be consistent with the following principles.

a) **Competitive Advantage:** Because grants are typically competitively awarded, SMUD will select its grant partners or participate on a grant team where the partners provide a competitive advantage in the grant selection process. Time permitting and where practical, SMUD will select qualified grant partners through a formal or informal request for qualifications.

b) **Viable Grant Partners:** SMUD shall only contract with reputable and financially viable grant partners.

c) **Local Grant Partners:** All other things being equal, in selecting grant partners SMUD will generally prefer governmental entities, not-for-profit organizations, and businesses located in the Sacramento region.

d) **Delegation of Authority to the CEO:** The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager (CEO) is delegated authority to select and enter into contracts with grant partners and file grant applications where SMUD’s commitment of financial and in-kind resources to the grant does not exceed $3 million is consistent with delegations under other Board-Staff Linkage policies, or is otherwise brought to the Board for approval as a budgeted project.

e) **Reporting:** The CEO shall provide advance notice to the Board of grant commitments that create material financial, reputational, or operational risk.
