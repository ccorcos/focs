# What is a Prepay?

- 2003 IRS Regulations allow for tax-exempt debt to be issued for the prepayment of natural gas/electricity to serve load
- Commodity supply agreement where buyer commits to purchase the commodity over a term, receiving a discount to the market price
- Cost of funding is lower than supplier would otherwise receive borrowing from taxable market or from using internal funding at their cost of capital
- Bond investor risk is tied to supplier and corporate guarantor (not SMUD) to make debt service payments and redeem bonds if termination events occur or bankruptcy

# Commodity Prepay Summary

- In 2018 Bonds were issued the Northern California Energy Authority (NCEA), to prepay for a 30-year supply of commodities  
  ➤ $0.48/dekatherm discount = $3 million annual commodity savings from 2019-2023

- The 2018 prepay bonds require repricing by July 2024  
  ➤ NCEA plans to issue up to $800 million of similar bonds this spring for a 6-year term that optimizes the savings that SMUD receives

- Current pricing indicates SMUD will save $3+ million annually on commodity costs from a $0.50-0.55/dekatherm discount

# Prepay Flexibility

## Flexibility to support SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan
- Allows for a switch to renewables or biogas to align with resource plans or adapt to new technologies or regulatory changes
- Natural Gas is currently needed to support reliability and new technologies such as Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS)
- Reduces operating costs to help SMUD reach zero carbon by 2030
- Contractual provisions protect SMUD savings

# NCEA Budget Augmentation

- The NCEA Board needs to approve an increase in the NCEA budget due to current bond pricing

- When the NCEA 2024 budget was developed and approved:
  - The debt service was based on existing bonds and the minimum savings amount
  - The Administrative and General Budget did not have the cost of issuance for this transaction included

- New Budget for approval:
  - Bond Principal & Interest Expense: $46 million
  - Administrative & General: $15 million

- This does not raise commodity costs for SMUD and is solely an authorization to pay the new expenditures for NCEA. The expenses are included in calculating the net $3+ million in annual savings to SMUD.
