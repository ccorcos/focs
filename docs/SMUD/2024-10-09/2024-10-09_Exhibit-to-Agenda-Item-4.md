# Proposed Revision to GP-15 Language

a) Each Board member shall have an annual budget for travel and training, which shall be adjusted annually for inflation based on the Travel Price Index (July-June) and rounded to the nearest hundred dollars. The training budget shall include funds for attendance at community functions and baseline dues in organizations that further Board members’ professional development, when accompanied by written justification.

# Reason for Change

- Travel Price Index is no longer freely available to public and has a sizable fee
- Consumer Price Index (CPI) is widely used inflation indicator
