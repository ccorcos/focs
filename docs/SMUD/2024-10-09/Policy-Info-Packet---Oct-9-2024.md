1. **Background**  
   Strategic Direction SD-6, Safety Leadership states that:  
   Creating a safe environment for employees and the public is a core value of SMUD.  

   Through best practice methods and continuous improvement, SMUD will be recognized as a leader in employee safety while also assuring the safety of the public related to SMUD operations and facilities. SMUD commits to a proactive approach, including the active involvement of SMUD leadership, employees, contractors, and the community, as well as comprehensive monitoring of organizational and public safety performance.  

   Therefore, SMUD will continue to improve safety results to:  

   a) **Workplace Safety**  
   i. Reduce SMUD’s injury severity incidents to 13 or less than by 2025, as measured by OSHA’s Days Away Restricted Time (DART), a rate that demonstrates top quartile safety performance for similar size utilities using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) work-related safety data.  
   ii. Provide timely, quality health care for injured employees that aids their recovery while maintaining positive financial performance of the workers’ compensation program.  

   b) **Contractor Safety**  
   i. Support contractors to reduce and eliminate potential hazards for Serious Injuries and/or Fatality (SIF) when conducting high risk work.  

   c) **Public Safety**  
   i. Track and report injuries to the public related to SMUD operations or facilities.  
   ii. Implement measures to protect the public from injuries related to SMUD operations or facilities.

2. Executive Summary

SMUD is in compliance with the SD-6 direction and is in alignment with SMUD’s new 5-year strategy of working toward a zero-incident culture.

**Workplace Safety**  
SMUD has recorded 11 OSHA Recordables injuries in the first half of 2024. This is a 48% decrease from this time last year (21 OSHA Recordables). Of the 11 injuries, 5 (3 Lost Time & 2 Modified Duty injuries) resulted in a 0.45 DART rate. This represents a continued decrease in injuries which is trending downward to meet our 2025 Target. (See Appendix A).

Quality care of injured employees is measured through the Workers’ Compensation program’s performance, which is assessed annually by an independent actuary. SMUD continues to have a reduction in indemnity benefits over the past three years as presented below. However, the number of claims and injury frequency rates have increased.

| Fiscal Year | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| No. of Claims (Medical & Indemnity) | 89 | 59 | 54 | 46 | 63* |
| Incident rate per 100 employees | 2.3 | 2.4 | 2.2 | 1.8 | 2* |
| Rates per $100 payroll | .94 | .85 | .67 | .58 | .50* |

*2024 data provided is a projection at the time the Actuary Report was prepared and may change.

**Contractor Safety**  
SMUD continues to use ISN to evaluate safety records and performance for high-risk contractors. This evaluation focuses on Contractor Fatality History, OSHA Citation History, DART and Total Recordable Incident Rates (TRIR), Insurance Experience Ratio, Safety Culture Questions, and Safety Program Review. Currently SMUD has 136 contractors in the ISN system.

This year we have increased the number of site safety evaluations for high-risk contractors to validate safety performance on the jobsites. Safety has completed 214 site safety visits through the 1st half of 2024 and are well on our way to meet the 2024 goal of 250 evaluations. These visits focus on SMUD contractors who work with Power Generation, Environmental Services, Line, Substation, Facilities and Vegetation Management on projects where high-risk work is performed. This work includes high voltage work, working at heights, vegetation management, confined spaces, excavations, etc. Additionally, we have fully integrated the use of the SMS system for inspections, incident tracking, reporting and investigations of SMUD contractors. This allows SMUD to verify safe working practices by our contractors to reduce the potential for serious injuries or property damage. Contractor reported incidents require an investigation to be completed, and typically will warrant additional site safety visits to verify corrective measures have been put into place to reduce further occurrences.

The Contractor Safety Team is working with ISN to pilot a safety training qualifications tool. This tool will allow a more efficient method of verifying Contractor Employee qualification. An example of this would be the SMUD Specific Vegetation Safety Orientation that will allow SMUD to communicate safe work practice expectation to our contractors. The Contractor Safety Team also partnered with the Vegetation Management Team for the 2024 Contractor Safety Day.

event is aimed to set expectations to our Vegetation Contractors doing high risk work. This event is an effective way of reaching Vegetation Contractor employees.

In addition, SMUD Procurement and Safety have partnered to enhance contract language as it relates to contractor safety requirements, Request for Proposal (RFP) templates for high-risk work and incorporating contractor safety as part of the onboarding process. The Contractor Safety Team is currently working closely with Procurement on the RFP Reviews for high stake Contracts such as the PCC, Substation Builds, Vegetation Management Line Clearance, Line Pole Replacement, and Cable Replacement RFP’s.

## Public and Community Safety

### Public Safety Statistics
SMUD tracks public and community incidents in the Safety Incident Tracking System (SITS) involving car-pole, electrical contacts, dig-in incidents, and injuries to the public that are related to SMUD’s operations or facilities. The following statistics are reported for the 1st half 2024:
- There have been 143 incidents where the public struck a SMUD asset with a vehicle, with two fatalities from such events.
- Three electrical contact incidents were reported and have become personal injury claims pending further investigation.
- There have been 28 dig-in incidents reported with no injuries. In response to these incidents, SMUD’s public safety team has sent out 15 notification letters to contractors and customer’s responsible for the dig-in occurrence as a proactive effort to provide further awareness and education on best practices to avoid future occurrences. This is a new practice that was started to support this program.

### Public Safety Events
SMUD’s Health & Safety and Line department personnel attended the Elk Grove Regional Safety Day event to provide educational outreach and resources to the Elk Grove and Galt community members in attendance. The resources provided were in promotion of digging safely around our underground lines and the USA 811 process. Approximately 2500 attendees were noted in 2024. This event was also a way for SMUD to support local area first responders for the Consumers Services District (CSD).

SMUD’s Health & Safety supported the Jackson Laboratory’s Safety Awareness week by hosting a booth in support of public safety around SMUD equipment and infrastructure. Specifically, SMUD health and safety provided handouts, giveaways, prizes, and informational resources on how to remain safe around downed lines and the USA 811 process with an emphasis on the “Call Before You Dig” campaign.

SMUD’s Public Safety team participated in a joint training and awareness effort with PG&E for Sacramento City Fire Department’s (SFD) Officer’s training class. SMUD provided knowledge on high-voltage equipment identification, SMUD’s unique assets, and discussed future collaboration efforts with their leadership teams over the course of three days.

### New Public Safety Initiatives
The public safety team has partnered with Culver Communications to upgrade the smudsafety.com website geared toward third-party contractors, agricultural workers, and educators. The site functionality and aesthetics have been improved. Also, additional language has been added to enhance clarity and usability.
<!-- Page 11 -->
![Board Monitoring Report - SD-6, Safety Leadership](https://example.com/image-url)

options have been added to the smudsafety.com website in order to represent the diverse community SMUD continues to serve.  
SMUD’s Marketing department and public safety team have partnered together to build out a campaign in support of public safety and workplace safety. This new campaign initiative involves building awareness on preventing obstructions near SMUD’s infrastructure. The broad campaign was developed based upon the labor requests from the Joint Labor Management Safety Committee (JLMSC). The campaign message will be delivered to the general public in several formats, including social media, Connections Newsletters, and bill inserts in the remainder of 2024.

### 3. Additional Supporting Information
The new SD-6 Safety Direction became effective February 2021. Our goal is to achieve the desired performance objectives by year-end 2025. This report summarizes the first half of the 2022 safety performance.

**Safety Leadership**  
The Safety Team continues with its integration efforts to support Executive Leadership’s 5-year plan that emphasizes zero incidents and injuries and a focus on a zero-accident safety culture. SMUD’s Executive Leadership team continue to emphasize our Safety priority with all personnel, contractors and in the public. We continue to grow our Safety for Life culture by reducing the risk of serious injuries and fatalities, targeting messages to staff on topics beyond work related risks, and looking for new way to maintain engagement. These goals are outlined in SMUD’s Safety Road Map, which was last updated in 2023.

**Safety Management System (SMS)**  
During the first half of 2024, Optimization of Benchmark Gensuite, SMUD’s Safety Management System (SMS) continued. AI functionalities within SMS were explored and are currently being piloted in the ergo evaluation application. Supervisor employee interactions were a targeted focus with office personnel. Forms were updated and new forms created to insure that frequently performed tasks are being observed during these interactions. A new incident type and log was created in the Incident & Measurements application to meet the new OSHA regulation on Workplace Violence. Enhancements to the Sustainability, ACE Forms, Concern Report and ATS application have been implemented to better align with SMUD’s processes and Core Competencies. Electronic tailboards continue to be enhanced with human performance (HP) being utilized in the process. New projects and process improvements continue to evolve with increased utilization and visibility among the workforces.

**Safety Standards Development**  
The Safety Team continues our ongoing process of updating SMUD’s Health & Safety Standards, as a foundation and in support of the organization’s World Class Safety initiatives. The Core Standards Team has been utilizing the same routing process as the Sacramento Power Academy, through SharePoint. This process has proven positive to bringing updates and new Standards to completion.

The Standards Team has also been working on the implementation of new regulatory requirements, including:
- Workplace Violence Prevention Plan (CA Labor Code 6401.7 and 6401.9), added to the Injury & Illness Prevention Program, as Appendix B; and

GM 24-144  
Board Monitoring Report - SD-6, Safety Leadership  
Page 4 of 11
<!-- Page 12 -->
![Board Monitoring Report - SD-6, Safety Leadership](https://example.com/image.png)

Information on the additional regulatory requirements and how SMUD leadership and employees should respond to these potential safety situations, to prevent incidents, will continue to be provided to all SMUD personnel in various formats, including Safety Meetings, ENN's, on-site electronic monitors, drop-in meetings, and Safety Training.

**Supervisor-Employee Interactions**  
Safety continues to strengthen the quality of the supervisor-employee interaction program by improving inspections and moving the process to the Safety Management System (SMS). Emphasis is placed on field visits for work with the highest hazard potential. Team Members continued visiting various crews throughout SMUD, to assist with employee safety concerns, processes, procedures, and equipment. For office personnel, an emphasis is placed on observing personnel pertaining to ergonomic risk, and slip/trip/fall hazards in walking areas. Eleven Q&A sessions were completed to support business units and leaders, navigate SMS ACE Forms and data mining reports to stay on top of their progress. Safety staff scheduled director level meetings where leaders received step by step tutorials, targets where established and the SMS Supervisor Employee interactions process was discussed. During the first half of 2024, a total of 3,418 Supervisor-Employee interactions were complete which resulted in 164% percentage observed.

**Near Miss and Positive Observation/Good Catch Reporting**  
Leadership continues to support and encourage near miss and positive observation/good catch reporting. The goal of this process is to identify opportunities for learning, prior to an incident occurring. During the first two quarters of 2024, 92 near miss and positive observation/good catch reports have been reported and recorded in the Safety Management System (SMS). Seventy-two have been recorded using the Concern Reporting application and 20 in Incident & Measurements application.

**4. Challenges**  
**Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs)**  
The SMUD Safety Team continues to partner with business units to reduce all WMSD's. In this hybrid Awards work environment, Safety continues to conduct Ergonomic evaluations in the office, field, and virtually for remote workers, to meet the needs of the workforce. Safety continues to consult with a Board-Certified Professional Ergonomist and other soft tissue injury reduction specialists to review opportunities for improvements of our Ergonomics Program, such as using AI technology for assessments and data collection. The Field Ergo Committee has been actively engaging with substation, field metering and hazmat crews conducting ergonomic assessments of various work tasks. Safety and Substation leadership partnered with ergo experts to initiate a strength and physical condition pilot program with the Substation Apprentices; results have been favorable.

**5. Recommendation**  
SMUD is committed to becoming a recognized leader in safety. Both SMUD’s leadership team and employees recognize that to achieve success we must integrate safety into all that we do. It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-6.

6. Appendices - World Class Safety Program Improvements & Supporting Information

**Safety for Life**  
Safety and Environmental Day is on track for the second year since COVID. The event will be held at Safety Center’s Safetyville in October and welcomes all SMUD employees and their families. It will be Harvest theme with haystacks and plenty of decorations, kids are encouraged to dress up. Some of the events will be pedestrian safety, bicycle safety, and a CPR class along with multiple vendors and SMUD booths like CalTrans, SCORCH, Fleet Feet, Environmental team, Sac Metro Fire, and much more!

Sparky’s Crew continues to get families involved in safety by sending safety postcards and quarterly newsletters to SMUD children enrolled.

Our Safety for Life communications continue. This year we have placed emphasis on doing “About Me’s” for the SMUD Safety team so employees can get to know all of the Safety Team members.

**Driver Safety**  
In 2024 Safety hosted our first driving rodeos for the Line Department. Four of these rodeos took place in April and four in June. The driving rodeo team has two more planned for fall for the Facilities team as well as the Energy Specialist team. A preventable vehicle accident team has been established and reviews SMUD’s PVA’s every two weeks. This team looks for trending data and uses the data during the rodeos to have discussions with the employees and prevent further PVA’s. Safe driving is being emphasized in vehicle reports that are provided to directors and management as they contact for participating business units. The reports capture speeding and seat belt use. Leaders are able to use this information in their interactions to help mitigate unsafe driving behaviors as well as reinforce safe driving behaviors. Modifications to the report continue to be made based on feedback from leaders and their business unit.

SMITH training continues to be provided to new hires, as well as existing employees due for refresher, continuing to elevate their driving performance. This is performed with internal trainers and SMITH instructors alike. The Safety team also trained additional leadership under E&O to perform driving-based SCORCH observations on their staff, adding value and focus to their observations.

Messaging in the form of highly visible banners continues to be installed in the Yard at ECOC, while opportunities for HQ Campus and Fresh Pond are under evaluation. These banners offer simple, straightforward reminders of key safe driving behaviors where they matter most – visible to our drivers while in the vehicle. Messaging in regular safety meetings has been tailored to target specific trends observed in internal accident data. Meanwhile, the safe driving decal refresh project is ongoing in collaboration with Fleet.

**Workplace Violence**  
SMUD Health and Safety team collaborated with PS&S, Security and the PMO staff to refresh the Workplace Violence Prevention Plan (WVPP) to meet new SB-553 and Cal/OSHA requirements. A few significant changes include:
- Workplace Violence Specialist (working title), which is supported by Security, PS&S and H&S.
- Incorporated in SMUD’s Safety Management System a Violence Incident Log. 

GM 24-144  
Board Monitoring Report - SD-6, Safety Leadership  
Page 6 of 11
<!-- Page 14 -->
- Learning & Development created LMS training to build awareness throughout the organization.

COVID-19 Support  
The safety of our employees is of utmost importance, so we continue to perform contact tracing and ensure employees report SMUD COVID-19 cases. As they are reported a dedicated team ensures that state requirements are followed. The Cal-OSHA Emergency Temporary Standard is sunsetting in February of 2025, and SMUD Safety, People, Services, & Strategies, along with Communications have updated the COVID-19 guidance to meet regulation changes within the Cal-OSHA Emergency Temporary Standard as the regulation is nearing sunsetting. Our third-party vendor Axiom Medical continues to provide staff with illness leave guidance. Our process continues to be followed and has prevented large outbreaks or work stoppages to critical areas of operations.

Wildfire Smoke  
In April of 2023, the HRO Safety Team reviewed the Health & Safety Standard for Wildfire Smoke for any gaps and collaborated with other work groups to ensure any necessary equipment, to reduce employee exposures were available and ready to deploy. In addition, there was a review and update of the Wildfire Smoke Training to ensure field crew members received information on how to access resources, should a Wildfire Smoke event occur. The training was delivered to all field crew personnel in June 2024. Examples of resources available to SMUD employees are: the use of the Purple Air monitoring system, in cab vehicle HEPA air filters, PPE, and scheduling. This year, to date, we have had 1 day of notifications. This was only an air quality status report due to a local fire that had broke out. AQI threshold did not exceed 150. Staff is also researching new wildfire smoke applications such as Watch Duty, which can help track fire that impact our infrastructure and field personnel.

Fire Retardant Clothing  
All employees who work on or around energized equipment are allotted a yearly FR Clothing allowance to ensure they are adequately protected. To ensure employees have access to clothing which meets the Arc Flash requirements of SMUD equipment and the latest FR material technologies to improve their level of comfort in various types of weather conditions (i.e., storms, cold, rain, or heat), Safety works with the FR Vendor, to host an annual review (in the Fall) of the latest offerings from the top FR Clothing Manufacturers and a sample of affected SMUD employees, for input. Safety is in process of scheduling this annual review. New employees of the electrical trades will receive FR Clothing Training by a Safety Representative to ensure employee is added to the FR Clothing portal and is apprised of the proper care and maintenance of their clothing.

Joint Labor Management Safety Committees  
Hydro JLMSC – Advanced First Responder training was completed to comply with Cal/OSHA standards regarding the administration of breathing air and stop-bleeding apparatus. Confined Space Rescue training has been completed amongst the field staff to ensure prompt response to any confined space rescue needs. Loon Lake Machine Hall evacuation procedure has been finalized and will be followed up with the production of a training video as well as evacuation exercises.

Line Assets JLMSC – A variety of safety improvements are in progress or already completed through the Line Assets JLMSC. Key improvements to highlight are: 1) Partnership between Line, Warehouse and Safety to update the inventory of Trauma Bags, including inspecting
<!-- Page 15 -->
![Board Monitoring Report - SD-6, Safety Leadership](https://example.com/image.png)

current trauma bags, replacing expired materials and adding in new products such as splints and tourniquets. 2) Partnership between Line, Public Safety and Communications to develop a communication plan with customers to highlight the importance of maintaining clear access to SMUD equipment on customer properties for both customer reliability and safety of our employees. 3) Line, Safety and Telecom partnered to identify a solution to a communication issue during Helicopter operations. Solution has been identified and is currently in the process of being funded, purchased and built.

**Substation JLMSC** – A Substation emergency response procedure was established and implemented. Tabletop and on-site exercises were conducted with both the work group personnel and the Emergency Preparedness Team to verify validity of this procedure and process.

**Safely Conducted Observations Reduce Common Hazards (SCORCH)**

**Observation Engagement & Behavior Trends**  
For the first half of 2024, a total of 2471 employees were observed under the Office & Professional process. Head/Neck Posture was both the top safe and at-risk behavior for this time frame. Risk Reduction Reminders are moving the needle in a positive direction. Validated in moving from a 2nd half at-risk rating of 28.5% in 2023 to a 1st half rating of 22% in 2024. Resulting in a total behavior reduction rating of 6.5%. Guidance was provided for elevating awareness on Mondays and in the AM hours of the workday based on data analytics. Monitor distance and height tips combined with job aids for adjusting font and display settings are also proving to be effective. Reminders were shared in monthly Safety for Life meetings, along with providing newly created leadership specific messaging that could be inserted into employee one-on-one safety interactions/conversations, and small team meetings.

A total of 1854 field employees under the Electrical Trades and CFAS process, were observed for the 1st half of 2024. Observation feedback displayed the consistency in which Hand Protection was worn, making it the top observed safe behavior. Observation feedback highlighted the consistency in which employees took steps for minimizing exposure by wearing the proper type of glove per task, importance of proactively testing and making sure gloves are free of holes and tears. Opportunity for improvement was related to the top at-risk behavior of Knee Protection/Ergo Mat. Employees displayed a low perception of risk and awareness for potential soft-tissue related injury when performing kneeling/ground contacting task. Risk Reduction Reminders stressed the benefits of providing the knees a cushioned working surface no matter the frequency or duration. Though most employees use the ergo mat, the use of knee pads (attached to the body) was recommended to reduce leaving the kneeling mat behind in the truck and/or the lack of willingness for dragging it from location to location. Tips for considering knee pads as “shoes for the knees” spoke to the health benefits of how knee padding is designed to distribute pressure across the entire knee area, as well as to absorb some of the impact associated with moving around, shifting weight when changing positions or “walking” on your knees. We anticipate this behavior to trend and a positive fashion over the upcoming quarters.

**SCORCH Behavior Influencing Highlights:**
- **Internal Engagement** – After attending DEKRA’s 2024 National Safety in Action Conference in April.

- **Timely Process Updates** – Digital monitors installed in the Substations and Field Metering departments are used to provide specific information related to the number of current and year-to-date observations completed. Top trending safe and at-risk behaviors, along with Risk Reduction Reminders. This visible platform for leveraging and broadcasting the real-time data capabilities of the Safety Management System has been positively received. This allows for more proactive behavior adjustments to be made within the month/quarter versus the reactionary sharing of the data primarily in safety meetings. The success of this process pivot has garnered the attention and request by additional departments to install safety themed monitors. SCORCH is extremely excited and believes this will be a highly effective tool for maintaining a seeded level of engagement, self-ownership for working safely and continuous education.

- **Safety RoadMap Alignment** – SCORCH continues to partner with the High-Risk Operations team and Safety Management System (SMS) app lead, Jackie Raemes to insert behavior-based safety examples and definitions into traditional safety investigation practices. The investigation templates for both vehicle (PVA’s) and (injury) incidents, have been updated to include a CBI (Critical Behavior Inventory) behavioral selection option. This will enhance the supervisors and investigators behavior identification ability, the extraction of specific job task behaviors. This will also allow us to generate historical and trending vehicle and injury incident data for both participating and non-participating work groups. This will prove to be one of the most effective ways in which SCORCH displays its flexibility and willingness to make process modifications to allow for greater utilization of its principles, taking bold steps to performing at a World-Class safety level.

- **External/Community Engagement** – SCORCH with its 23 years of behavior influencing success was asked to present and provide its behavior-based best practice share at multiple safety events. This encompassed presentations at the DEKRA, Safety in Action Conference, (ASSP) American Society of Safety Professionals and the Region IX (VPPPA) Voluntary Protection Program Participants Association, Safety Summit. Presentations highlight the creative ways in which behavior awareness can expand beyond the workplace and easily inserted into employees at-home and at-play environments. This displays SMUD’s cultural commitment to Safety for Life and behavior-based safety as a lifestyle choice that intentionally engages family and friends.

![Confined Space Rescue](https://example.com/image.png)

**Confined Space Rescue**  
SMUD’s Confined Space Rescue program has expanded to include more robust training and support for field forces and safety trainers alike. These improvements help our field forces to be better equipped to both prevent and respond to real-world emergency situations.

During Bundled Training, field forces receive hands-on practice with entries and mock-rescue scenarios, specific to SMUD’s confined spaces. This was expanded to include additional groups who had not previously received this level of training. Additionally, these scenarios are undergoing review to maximize training value and consistency. Improvements were also made to SMUD’s confined space rescue equipment inspection, maintenance, and tracking operation this year. The rescue equipment necessary to perform this work was inspected by the manufacturer, Toolroom’s inventory was updated to include in-service equipment, and additional equipment was purchased to meet the evolving needs of our field forces.

In Q2, the Safety team also leveraged existing relationships with local confined space technical rescue contractors to ensure all SMUD field forces have access to these services. This has primarily benefited the Substations group and their transformer entry operations. Safety collaborated with one of these contractors and developed an updated rescue plan. As a result, the Safety department is prepared to deliver this complex training and provide related support to field forces on an as-needed basis. Simultaneously, Safety explored the use of new technologies to allow semi-remote inspection of transformer components, which reduces employee risk exposure by eliminating the need for entry into a high-risk environment.

With Hydro Operations consisting of multiple remote locations, employees from various work groups have undergone Non-Entry Confined Space Rescue training in order to provide prompt rescue services in-house. Along with this initial training, an annual refresher and real-life scenario mock rescue will occur. Rescue equipment upgrades and additions are underway, including an enclosed trailer dedicated to CSE Rescue equipment to ensure efficient mobilization.

**Heat Illness**  
SMUD continues to identify heat as one of the main hazards our employees face during the hot summer months. SMUD continues to train field-based employees each year on the signs/symptoms of heat illness, appropriate measures to reduce the potential for heat illness, as well as how to respond appropriately in the event of a heat-related emergency. SMUD’s tool room continues to offer a variety of solutions to combat working in the heat, including: water, ice, coolers, electrolyte supplements for water, portable shade structures, shade visors for hard hats.

The Network/Underground work group purchased and deployed an additional cooling trailer unit that can be used to provide both confined space ventilation as well as cooling of the air inside hot underground facilities during summer months. This reduces potential heat stress to the employees and allows for a safer work environment.

**Medical Monitoring**  
With the departure of our Onsite Medical Services provider EOMC, the health and safety team has begun migrating services to new vendors. This has included the use of onsite “pop-up clinics” to limit the need for SMUD employees to travel to off-site clinics. SMUD is working with the new vendors to migrate applicable records as well as set up dashboards that will be used to track employee seen for Medical Monitoring. Health and Safety will continue throughout.

3) Additional Supporting Information  
Project Implementation: SMUD’s Research and Development team has the primary responsibility of meeting SD-10; however, notable innovation occurs throughout SMUD.  

Electric Transportation (ET)  
Transportation electrification improves air quality and reduces net greenhouse gas emissions and petroleum consumption to support energy sustainability, while creating new revenue streams for SMUD. This strategy is supported through investigation of mitigation of grid impacts due to charging, improvement of electric vehicles (EV) value via pricing signals and remote controls, increased EV adoption and access to charging. SMUD is specifically exploring multiple opportunities to expand our understanding of managed charging (V1G) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capabilities, applications, and implications.  

Key Achievements:  
- SMUD has the eFuel program ready to deploy EV chargers to underserved multi-family homes as part of the ChargeReady Community project, a $2.23M California Energy Commission REACH grant awarded to SMUD in 2022. Final agreement execution with Mutual Housing will enable construction to begin later this year.  
- The Del Paso Mobility Hub (three level 2 and one DC fast charger) started public operations in October 2023. Based on two quarterly reports received so far, project economics rely heavily on grant funding for long term viability. Majority of revenue is from DCFC utilization (mostly by drivers coming from the freeway nearby).  
- The Residential Managed EV Charging pilot has enrolled over 1,200 vehicles from Tesla, GM, Ford and BMW. Early results show modest load impacts. Staff are working with the evaluator to refine the analysis estimating success of pilot in reducing future transformer overloads.  
- SMUD was awarded $2.9 million by the California Energy Commission to deliver the FAST grant, deploying 150+kW fast chargers at the Sacramento International Airport, Sacramento Valley Amtrak Station and Sacramento State University. These stations offer public charging at an affordable rate for all users and further discounts for rideshare drivers, ensuring access to public charging at rates comparable to charging. The chargers will be in areas where rideshare drivers already wait and queue for fares, reducing deadhead trips. Additionally, these chargers will be located in public lots, requiring no additional access fees.  
- The CEC BESTFIT grant with the Twin Rivers Unified School District (TRUSD) aims to evaluate the effectiveness of managed charging (V1G) and V2G capabilities of electric school buses and light duty vehicles to balance impacts on customer and utility electrical distribution infrastructure and create value through grid services. Targeted use cases include reduced grid impacts, reduced customer infrastructure costs, wholesale cost avoidance. The site is expected to be fully operational, reporting valid usage data and controlling charging by late September 2024, pending a firmware upgrade for some of the chargers onsite. SMUD and FordPro plan to begin use case testing in late September, running through the end of 2024.

- Continued collaboration with TEPCO, Fermata, and Nissan includes demonstration of V2G on SMUD’s campus using Fermata FE-20 bidirectional charger and SMUD’s fleet Nissan Leaf. This charger is UL certified with endorsement by Nissan that it does not void their vehicle warranty. The vehicle charge and discharge can successfully be scheduled via API. Third-party optimization in response to price signals had some unexpected results. Staff is working through the analysis.

**Energy Efficiency (EE) & Electric Buildings (EB)**  
This program area optimizes energy delivery costs and improves grid asset utilization through targeted, time-specific energy efficiency and building electrification as well as by capturing permanent outcomes in building codes. R&D explores emerging and underutilized technologies; working to lower barriers to technology adoption.

**Key Achievements:**  
- Phase 2 of the Home Infrastructure Planning project commenced, developing a model to estimate load profiles for single family residential customers after full electrification. Work will continue this year to expand the model to better represent SMUD’s full single family residential population, which will help distribution planners and customers make optimal decisions regarding utility service upgrades supporting residential electrification.

**Load Flexibility**  
This program supports cost-effective, reliable, scalable flexible resource growth to serve future grid needs. R&D determines functional, operational and market viability of flexible loads to align supply and demand, give customers bill management options, improve air quality, and reduce carbon emissions.

**Key Achievements:**  
- SMUD funded the New Buildings Institute and Lawrence Berkley National lab to recruit from the 32 - 120V Heat Pump Water Heater (HPWH) installations statewide last year to test the use of CTA-2045 modules for price and load response. Technical difficulty prevented the Advanced Load Up command from functioning properly, however the Load Up command still shifted 39% of HPWH load away from utility peak periods, resulting in average utility bill savings of 24% of HPWH consumption costs.  
- Phase 3 DERMS features to enable market and distribution-based operation of DERs have been implemented, integrated, and tested in coordination with flexible heat pump water heaters under the PowerMinder pilot program. In anticipation of Phase 3 go-live in Q4 2024, stakeholder discussions are underway to identify DERMS enabled processes for shared visibility into DER operations by distribution and bulk system operators. The operational processes include coordination with planning stakeholders to recognize avoided long-term costs, displaced by flexible DERs.  
- Smart inverters allow utilities to monitor residential PV and storage (potentially as an alternative to generation submeters) and provide control functionality to assist in grid support. This project will test smart inverter connection via two pathways: direct connection and through vendors/aggregators. Data analysis was completed for the Direct Connection pathway, which used the IEEE 2030.5-CSIP protocol successfully in GM 24-144 Board Monitoring Report: SD-10, Innovation Page 3 of 11.

![Board Monitoring Report: SD-10, Innovation](https://example.com/image.png)

the majority of tests without issue. There remain some interoperability issues that hopefully will largely be fixed in the next 3.0 update. The Vendor/Aggregator pathway has gone through lab testing with an IEEE 2030.5-CSIP server and will start customer testing by Q4 2024. Direct connection will assist in development of the DERMS, while the vendor/aggregator pathway will leverage OEM and aggregator relationships to establish pilot access agreements to a broader range of smart inverters.

**Thermal Transition**  
R&D pursues innovative grid, storage and generation solutions to facilitate SMUD’s goal of zero carbon by 2030 and accelerate interconnection of grid-connected systems and devices to ensure safe and efficient operation. This program supports system reliability and reducing emissions through alignment of DERs and zero-carbon generation with grid needs. It seeks to improve grid reliability through reduced outage frequency and duration; control of the distribution system, voltage and frequency variations, and overload conditions; and optimize grid benefits of DERs through advancing integration standards and coordinated automation.

**Key Achievements:**
- The ESS Phase 1 demonstration will deploy 4 MW / 30 MWh of Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) iron flow batteries. This project will compare the reliability and uptimes of LDES and Lithium-Ion batteries as part of SMUD’s partnership with ESS. Two ESS battery models will be tested: the Energy Warehouse and Energy Center. Site Acceptance Testing (SAT) and troubleshooting continues to be in progress for the 6 Energy Warehouses deployed. SMUD was awarded a $10 million grant from the California Energy Commission to test 3.6 MW of the Energy Center product as part of the ESS Phase 1 demonstration. Preliminary design of the Energy Center build is in process in preparation for the Engineering Procurement and Construction solicitation.
- Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) and Green Hydrogen remain the leading alternative fuel candidates to convert and decarbonize thermal generation fleet operations longer term. SMUD continues to be engaged in the CEC Hydrogen Blending grant led by UCLA and the DOE Hyblend grant led by NREL. SMUD is pursuing participation in Phase 2 of the DOE Hyblend grant.

**Climate Change**  
This program provides technical, economic, and policy expertise on climate change and impacts to SMUD territory. It compliments SMUD’s Zero Carbon Plan and aligns with our board direction to address climate vulnerabilities, and we partner with our customers and community on mitigation opportunities and regenerative, net positive projects.

**Key Achievements:**
- Carbon Farming and Ecosystem Service Research is a four-year study aiming to restore California prairie and native pollinator habitat under PV panels and in surrounding perimeter areas at Rancho Seco II. In its second year, the project completed a second native pollinator seeding within the panels, installed a half mile of hedgerow with native

| Building Electrification  | 120 | Home Infrastructure Planning Phase II (HIP II) | This project is developing a Residential End State model to provide load growth insights and intelligence to optimize decision-making for distribution system upgrades, recommend program offerings, and estimate the likely magnitude of impacts from residential electrification due to panel upgrades and distribution grid upgrades. | Better understanding of the infrastructure needs for fully electrified residences should help reduce the costs incurred by SMUD and our residential customers as they electrify their homes and vehicles. This will help to reduce future rate increases expected from the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan and accelerate our decarbonization transition of residential homes. | 5/1/2023  | 12/31/2024 | All  |
| Building Electrification  | 67  | St. Francis Manor Central HPWH Study | SMUD staff monitored the performance and benefits of converting a gas powered (boiler) domestic hot water system to a heat pump water heater (HPWH) driven system and found that primarily due to incorrect flows/piping of the water flow and the addition of a kitchen, there was insufficient hot water throughout the whole year for the tenants/kitchen. However, solutions have been identified (adjust the direction of the water flow and install a dedicated HPWH for the kitchen) to meet the customer's needs and deem this project as a successful option for businesses to electrify. | Prior to the addition of an unplanned commercial kitchen, the impacts of the original water heater electrification project were as follows: Estimated savings of $2,233 annual energy cost saving (20%) compared to gas boiler (54% reduction in CO2 emissions). Conclusion: HPWH system is a cost-effective replacement for any building that already uses a central water heater. | 4/1/2021  | 9/30/2023  | 5    |

## Community Choice Aggregator Detail

Community Choice Aggregation. In 2002, Assembly Bill 117 was passed to establish Community Choice Aggregation in the State by authorizing Community Choice Aggregators (“CCAs”) to aggregate customer electric load and purchase electricity for customers. SMUD sees the growth of CCAs as an opportunity to support organizations with values closely aligned with SMUD’s values, while also generating additional revenue for SMUD. CCA programs are proliferating in the State thanks to support for expanding renewable energy use and desire for local control particularly for electricity procurement. There are numerous CCAs operating in the State, and more are anticipated to launch in the future. CCAs are responsible for procuring wholesale power, setting the generation rate, and staffing a call center to handle opt-outs and questions about the power portfolio. The local investor-owned utility (“IOU”) continues to deliver electricity from the electric grid, maintain its electric infrastructure, bill customers and collect payments.

In October 2017, SMUD contracted with Valley Clean Energy (“VCE”). VCE is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the City of Woodland, the City of Davis and Yolo County to implement a local CCA program. The service territory expanded to include the City of Winters in 2021.

In February 2018, SMUD contracted with Ava Community Energy (“Ava” formerly East Bay Community Energy). Ava is a joint powers agency formed in 2016 by the cities of Albany, Berkeley, Dublin, Emeryville, Fremont, Hayward, Livermore, Oakland, Piedmont, San Leandro and Union City in Alameda County to implement a local CCA.

### NARRATIVE:  
**Requested Action:**  
Discuss, with possible amendment, proposed revisions to Governance Process GP-15, Board Travel and Training Reimbursement.  

**Summary:**  
Pursuant to Governance Process GP-15, Board Travel and Training Reimbursement (GP-15), the budget for Board member travel and training is annually adjusted for inflation using the publicly available Travel Price Index (TPI). In recent months, access to certain of the TPI information now requires an annual subscription that is quite costly. Staff recommends a revision to the policy language to reflect that the budget will be annually adjusted for inflation but allows for the flexibility to use other reliable data to process the increase in the event the TPI data typically used is unavailable at the time needed due to the subscription model. Although TPI data is publicly posted, the schedule for which it is made available is inconsistent and unpredictable. Proposed revisions are attached in “redline” and “clean” format.  

**Board Policy:**  
Governance Process GP-1, Purpose of Board – Subsection a) Identify and define the purpose, values and vision of SMUD and communicate them in the form of policy.

# SMUD BOARD POLICY

**Category:** Governance Process  
**Policy No.:** GP-8  
**Title:** Board Committee Principles  

The Board may establish standing committees and the president may establish ad hoc committees based on need and input from the Board members.

Standing committees shall assist the Board in its ongoing work and activities. Standing committees shall be composed of three Board members, including a chair and vice-chair, who shall be appointed by the Board President. Any other Board member may attend and participate in the deliberations of any standing committee. Each standing committee shall have a charter describing the committee’s purpose. If a standing committee lacks a quorum of members for any meeting, the President, Vice-President, or Committee chair, in that order, may appoint a non-committee Board member to serve on the Committee for that meeting.

Ad hoc committees shall be created for a limited duration to address a specific topic of interest to the Board. Each ad hoc committee may be composed of two or three Board members, and shall include designation of a chair and a clear statement of purpose. Ad hoc committees are not required to provide public notice of their meetings under the Ralph M. Brown Act. Each ad hoc committee shall report back at a publicly noticed Board or standing committee meeting on its activities.

Specifically:

a) All committees will ordinarily assist the Board by gaining education, considering alternatives and implications, and preparing policy alternatives.

b) Board committees may not speak or act for the Board except when formally given such authority for specific and time-limited purposes.

c) Board committees cannot exercise authority over staff nor interfere with the delegation from the Board to the CEO. Because the CEO works for the full Board, he or she will not be required to obtain approval of a Board committee before an executive action.

d) As a general rule, items scheduled for Board action (including items requested by a Board member) shall first be presented to a standing committee for review.

e) Standing committees shall be reviewed at least annually by the Board to determine whether they should continue.
<!-- Page 55 -->
f) This policy applies to any group which is formed by Board action, whether or not it is called a committee and regardless of whether the group includes Board members. It does not apply to committees formed under the authority of the CEO.
