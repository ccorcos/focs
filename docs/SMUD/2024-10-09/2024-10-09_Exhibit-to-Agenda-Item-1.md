# Strategic Direction SD-6, Safety Leadership

Creating a safe environment for employees and the public is a core value of SMUD.

Through best practice methods and continuous improvement, SMUD will be recognized as a leader in employee safety while also assuring the safety of the public related to SMUD operations and facilities. SMUD commits to a proactive approach, including the active involvement of SMUD leadership, employees, contractors, and the community, as well as comprehensive monitoring of organizational and public safety performance.

Therefore, SMUD will continue to improve safety results to:

a) **Workplace Safety**  
   i) Reduce SMUD’s injury severity incidents to 13 or less than by 2025, as measured by OSHA’s Days Away Restricted Time (DART), a rate that demonstrates top quartile safety performance for similar size utilities using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) work-related safety data.  
   ii) Provide timely, quality health care for injured employees that aids their recovery while maintaining positive financial performance of the workers’ compensation program.

b) **Contractor Safety**  
   i) Support contractors to reduce and eliminate potential hazards for Serious Injuries and/or Fatality (SIF) when conducting high risk work.

c) **Public Safety**  
   i) Track and report injuries to the public related to SMUD operations or facilities.  
   ii) Implement measures to protect the public from injuries related to SMUD operations or facilities.
