# GP-8, Board Committee Principles

The Board may establish standing committees and the president may establish ad hoc committees based on need and input from the Board members.

Standing committees shall assist the Board in its ongoing work and activities. Standing committees shall be composed of three Board members, including a chair and vicechair, who shall be appointed by the Board President. Any other Board member may attend and participate in the deliberations of any standing committee. Each standing committee shall have a charter describing the committee’s purpose. If a standing committee lacks a quorum of members for any meeting, the President, Vice-President, or Committee chair, in that order, may appoint a non-committee Board member to serve on the Committee for that meeting.

Ad hoc committees shall be created for a limited duration to address a specific topic of interest to the Board. Each ad hoc committee may be composed of two or three Board members, and shall include designation of a chair and a clear statement of purpose. Ad hoc committees are not required to provide public notice of their meetings under the Ralph M. Brown Act. Each ad hoc committee shall report back at a publicly noticed Board or standing committee meeting on its activities.

![GP-8, Board Committee Principles (cont.)](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=GP-8,+Board+Committee+Principles+(cont.))

**Specifically:**

a) All committees will ordinarily assist the Board by gaining education, considering alternatives and implications, and preparing policy alternatives.

b) Board committees may not speak or act for the Board except when formally given such authority for specific and time-limited purposes.

c) Board committees cannot exercise authority over staff nor interfere with the delegation from the Board to the CEO. Because the CEO works for the full Board, he or she will not be required to obtain approval of a Board committee before an executive action.

# GP-8, Board Committee Principles (cont.)

d) As a general rule, items scheduled for Board action (including items requested by a Board member) shall first be presented to a standing committee for review.

e) Standing committees shall be reviewed at least annually by the Board to determine whether they should continue. Governance Process GP-8 Page 2 of 2 Board Committee Principles.

f) This policy applies to any group which is formed by Board action, whether or not it is called a committee and regardless of whether the group includes Board members. It does not apply to committees formed under the authority of the CEO.
