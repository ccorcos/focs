**Requested Action:**  
Authorize the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager to negotiate and award a contract to Utility Partners of America for meter replacement services for a period of one year, with two optional one-year extensions, for a total not-to-exceed amount of $21,442,000.

**Summary:**  
In October 2023, SMUD was awarded $50 million from the Department of Energy Grid Deployment Office’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) program for SMUD’s Connected Clean PowerCity. The Connected Clean PowerCity project will enhance SMUD’s infrastructure to interact with technology and customers at the grid’s edge, establishing improved visibility, management, and control.

As part of the project, we will deploy up to 200,000 Itron Riva meters with up to eight Distributed Intelligence apps per meter to support various use cases. A condition of the GRIP grant requires installation of 5,000 meters per month in September and October 2024, and 19,000 per month from November 2024 through August 2025.

For the meter installation services, on February 5, 2024, SMUD issued Request for Proposal No. Doc#413278410 (RFP) to solicit qualified firms to install 200,000 SMUD-furnished Itron Riva meters. On February 14, 2024, SMUD held an online Pre-Proposal Conference that was attended by four Contractors. On March 7, 2024, SMUD received one proposal from Utility Partners of America. Their proposal was evaluated in accordance with the advertised criteria and was found to be responsive. SMUD initiated and continues to negotiate a contract with Utility Partners of America for an aggregate not-to-exceed amount of $21,442,000 upon successful completion of negotiations. The current result of the solicitation is shown below.

**DEPARTMENT**  
Procurement  

**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:**  
Approve Contract Change No. 1 to Contract No. 4600001773 with Kortick Manufacturing, LLC, for supply of network transformers, to extend the contract expiration date from November 14, 2024, to February 28, 2026, and increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by $10 million, from $11 million to $21 million.  

**Summary:**  
Contract No. 4600001270 was awarded on a competitive basis to Frase Enterprises, Inc. in May 2019 for supply of network transformer to support SMUD’s ongoing maintenance requirements. The original contract was awarded for the period from May 15, 2019 to May 14, 2023, for a not-to-exceed amount of $1 million. Contract Change No. 1 increased the contract not to exceed amount from $1 million to $3.5 million and added one new transformer stock code to the contract. Contract Change No. 2 increased the contract amount from $3.5 million to $8 million and extended the contract expiration date from May 14, 2023 to May 14, 2024. Contract Change No. 3 increased the contract not-to-exceed amount from $8 million to $11 million and extended the contract expiration date from May 14, 2024 to November 14, 2024. Contract Change No. 4 assigned Contract No. 4600001270 with Frase Enterprises, Inc. to Kortick Manufacturing LLC. Contract No. 4600001270 was replaced with Contract No. 4600001773. This Contract Change No. 1 to Contract No. 4600001773 requests approval to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by $10 million, from $11 million to $21 million and extend the contract expiration date from November 14, 2024, to February 28, 2026. The original contract was intended to support SMUD’s ongoing maintenance requirements. SMUD’s Energy Delivery & Operations team identified a significant increase in our upcoming demand for network transformers with plans to replace approximately 50 network transformers each year through 2028. Due to equipment lead times, SMUD needs to order the network transformers now to maintain the transformer replacement schedule for 2025. SMUD is currently sourcing replacement contract(s) for network transformers with expectations to award later this year. The new contracts will not be awarded in time to place orders for work scheduled to take place in 2025 but will support the needed transformers for years 2026 through 2028.  

Currently, the contract balance is approximately $168,000.  

| Contract Actions | Amount | Cumulative Total | Description |
|------------------|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Original Contract 46000001270 | $1,000,000 |  |  |
| Change No. 01 | $2,500,000 | $3,500,000 | Increase contract value |
| Change No. 02 | $4,500,000 | $8,000,000 | Increase contract value and extend term. |

| Change No. 04 | $0           | $11,000,000 | Assign contract to Kortick Manufacturing. Contract No. 46000001270 replaced with Contract No. 46000001773. |
|----------------|--------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pending Change No. 1 | $10,000,000 | $21,000,000 | Increase contract value and extend term.                                                                  |

**Board Policy:** Board-Staff Linkage BL-8, Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement; Strategic Direction SD-4, Reliability.

**Benefits:** This contract change will allow SMUD to purchase network transformers required for replacement projects scheduled to take place in 2025.

**Cost/Budgeted:** $21,000,000; Budgeted for 2019 to 2026 by Energy Delivery & Operations.

**Alternatives:** Wait to order the network transformers until the new contract(s) are awarded and delay the network transformer replacement project. Delaying the transformer replacement increases the risk of transformer failure.

**Affected Parties:** Energy Delivery & Operations, Supply Chain Services, and Kortick Manufacturing, LLC.

**Coordination:** Energy Delivery & Operations and Supply Chain Services.

ACC 24-013  

SUBJECT: APRIL 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OPERATIONS DATA  

We are attaching the financial and operating reports for the four months of 2024. They include sales and generation statistics and other selected data.

The change in net position is an increase of $34.7 million compared to a budgeted decrease of $52.9 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $87.6 million.

We prepared these statements on the accrual basis of accounting, and they conform to generally accepted accounting principles. The bases for the budget amounts are:

1) Budgeted electric revenues are based on the Forecast of Revenues by the Pricing Department, adjusted for unbilled revenues; and

2) Budgeted operating expenses reflect the 2024 Budget approved by the Board of Directors on December 14, 2023.

# SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT  
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
### For the Four Months Ended April 30, 2024  

**Net Position**  
- The change in net position is an increase of $34.7 million compared to a budgeted decrease of $52.9 million, resulting in a favorable variance of $87.6 million.  

**Revenues**  
- Revenues from sales to customers were $447.8 million, which was $0.3 million higher than planned. The increase is primarily due to:  
  - Lower residential customer revenue of $8.2 million primarily due to lower customer usage.  
  - Higher commercial sales of $7.2 million primarily due to higher customer usage.  
  - Lower provision for uncollectible accounts of $1.0 million.  
- Revenues under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (Assembly Bill [AB] – 32) were $10.4 million. This is due to carbon allowances sold through the state sanctioned quarterly auctions.  
- Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) revenues were $3.4 million due to LCFS credit sales.  
- Other electric revenues were $2.9 million higher due to higher interconnection fees, transmission revenue, and Sacramento Power Academy revenue.  
- Non-cash revenues transferred to the rate stabilization fund were $23.2 million, of which $10.4 million was for AB-32, $9.3 million was for the annual WAPA Hydro Generation Adjustment and $3.4 million was for LCFS. Funds are deferred until SMUD has qualified program expenses (projects that reduce carbon emissions or electric vehicle programs) to recognize revenue.  
- Non-cash revenues transferred from the rate stabilization fund were $31.1 million, which was $23.7 million higher than plan. The increase is primarily due to $18.7 million of revenue recognized for AB-32 and $8.3 million was for revenue recognized for the annual Hydro Generation Adjustment.  

**Commodities, Purchased Power and Production**  
- SMUD’s generation was lower by 221 GWh (8.8 percent); JPA and other generation was lower by 285 GWh (14.4 percent); and Hydro generation was higher by 64 GWh (12.1 percent).  
- Purchased power expense of $99.3 million, less surplus power sales of $42.2 million, was $57.1 million, which was $3.4 million higher than planned. This increase is due to lower thermal generation that led to increased market purchases at favorable market prices.  
- Production operations cost of $123.0 million, less surplus gas sales of $29.2 million, was $93.8 million, which was $22.3 million lower than planned.  
  - Fuel costs of $80.2 million less surplus gas sales of $29.2 million, was $51.0 million, which was $18.6 million lower than planned. Thermal generation has decreased due to a planned outage at the Procter & Gamble plant and it was more economical to replace with hydro generation and market purchases.  
- The “power margin”, or sales to customers less cost of purchased power, production operations costs and gas hedges included in investment revenue was $297.5 million, which was $19.9 million higher than planned. The power margin as a percentage of sales to customers was 66.4 percent, which was 4.4 percent higher than planned. This is primarily due to lower production costs due to lower fuel costs.  

**Other Operating Expenses**  
- All other operating expenses were $343.0 million, which was $8.2 million higher than planned.  
  - Transmission and distribution operations expenses were down $5.5 million primarily due to lower transmission fees as a result of using more hydro generation than plan.  
  - Customer service and information expenses were down $3.1 million due to lower participation in My Energy Optimizer Partner and Peak Conserve programs and lower participation in the Commercial and Residential Greenergy programs.  
  - Administrative & General expenses were up $5.8 million primarily due to bond issuance costs and costs related to the February storm.  
  - Public Good expenses were $2.3 million higher than planned primarily due to increased HVAC and rebate volume in the Advanced Homes Solutions program. Also, higher than planned project completions in Smart Homes and earlier start in low income building electrification program initiatives.  
<!-- Page 18 -->
- Production maintenance expenses were $2.1 million higher than planned due to unplanned major repair at the Procter & Gamble Power Plant.
- Transmission and distribution maintenance expenses were $2.3 million higher than planned primarily due to higher costs related to the February storm response, offset by lower expenses than planned related to SMUD's Wildfire Mitigation Plan.
- Non-cash depreciation and amortization is higher by $3.3 million primarily due to the amortization of software subscription assets.

Non-operating Revenues and Expenses
- Other revenue, net, was $58.5 million higher than planned primarily due to a business interruption insurance recovery payment of $51.4 million related to the Cosumnes Power Plant and a settlement payment of $5.8 million related to the Rancho Seco annual spent fuel settlement, and higher interest income.

## OFFICE MEMORANDUM  

**TO:** Board of Directors  
**FROM:** Claire Rogers  
**DATE:** May 29, 2024  
**SUBJECT:** Green-e® Energy Annual Verification — Agreed-Upon Procedures  
**Audit Report #28007763**  

Internal Audit Services (IAS) has performed the procedures enumerated below, which were agreed to by SMUD and the Center for Resource Solutions, to verify SMUD’s compliance with annual reporting requirements of the Center for Resource Solutions’ Green-e® Energy program for the year ended December 31, 2023. SMUD’s management is responsible for compliance with the annual reporting requirements of the Center for Resource Solutions’ Green-e® Energy program.  

The sufficiency of these procedures is solely the responsibility of the specified users of the report. Consequently, we make no representation regarding the sufficiency of the procedures described below either for the purpose for which this report has been requested or for any other purpose.  

The procedures include, but are not limited to:  
- Validation and recalculation of Greenery (excluding Partner Plus) and Solar Shares retail sales;  
- Validation and recalculation of Greenery (excluding Partner Plus) and Solar Shares resource supply, or renewable energy credits (RECs), retired in the Western Electric Coordinating Council (WECC) WREGIS tracking system database;  
- Validation and recalculation of Greenery (excluding Partner Plus) and Solar Shares Product Content Labels.  

Based on the Green-e® Energy Audit Protocol and the results of the Agreed-Upon Procedures, IAS asserts that SMUD has no exceptions with regard to its compliance of the Green-e Energy verification reporting requirements put forth in the Annual Verification Protocol.  

The agreed-upon procedures engagement was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. IAS was not engaged to and did not conduct an examination or review, the objective of which would be the expression of an opinion or conclusion, respectively, on SMUD’s compliance to the annual reporting requirements of the Center for Resource Solutions’ Green-e® Energy program. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion or conclusion. Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to SMUD and the Center for Resource Solutions.
