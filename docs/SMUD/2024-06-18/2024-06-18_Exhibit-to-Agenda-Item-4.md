**April 2024 Financial Highlights**

- **Customer Revenue**  
  $448 Million  
  $0M variance with budget  
  • Customer revenue is at target; however, customer usage from our residential customers was lower than plan offset by higher customer usage from our commercial customers.

- **Commodity**  
  $169 Million  
  $17M or 9.1% lower commodity expenditures than budgeted (favorable)  
  • Production costs were under target due to increase hydro generation and lower fuels costs from the reduction in thermal generation.

- **Other Operating Expenses**  
  $325 Million  
  $6M or 1.9% higher expenditures than budgeted (unfavorable)  
  • Administrative & general expenses $5.8M higher due to bond issuance costs and storm response expenses.  
  • Public good expenses $2.3M higher due to higher than planned rebate volume in Advanced Home Solutions and building electrification programs.  
  • Customer service & information expenses $3.1M lower due to updated planned rollout schedule for My Energy Optimizer Partner and Peak Conserve programs.

- **Other Non-Operating Revenues**  
  $78 Million  
  $58M or 305.4% higher than budgeted (favorable)  
  • Primarily due to insurance recovery payment on Cosumnes power plant business interruption insurance claim, Rancho Seco settlement payment and interest income.

*There are $3M other net revenues not included in the highlights above*

# April 2024 Energy Sources

- **Thermal plants generation** was 29% lower than budget in April, and 14% lower year-to-date due to unplanned plant outage and higher hydro generation.
  
- **Net purchased power** was 32% higher than budget in April, and 25% higher year-to-date primarily due to decreased thermal generation than planned.
