- (2) unit hydroelectric generating plant, 156MW combined capacity
- Unit #1 – 13.8kV, 83.1MVA
  - Commissioned in 1968 by General Electric (GE)
  - Stator rewound in 1992
  - Stator core & field pole bodies are original
- Stator winding is nearing end of service life, aggressive signs of degradation observed
- December 2022, a stator winding insulation failure occurred. One coil was permanently bypassed. This usually prompts planning of a rewind.
- Overheating on field pole bodies appear to be life limiting if not addressed during this outage.

**Camino Unit #1 Generator Rehabilitation Procurement Strategy**

- SMUD and our engineering consultants have carefully developed tech specs that best suit our needs.
- This project requires extensive design, fabrication, & construction capabilities on a 1960’s vintage GE machine. Few companies in the world are technically qualified.
- Award to an experienced and qualified contractor is critical.
- Partnering with the generator OEM is often a best fit.
