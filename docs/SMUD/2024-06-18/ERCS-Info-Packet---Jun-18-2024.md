2. PROJECT, PURCHASE AND SALE OF PRODUCTS  
2.1 Project and Deliverability  
This Agreement governs Seller’s sale and delivery, and Buyer’s purchase and receipt, of Products from the Project. Seller agrees to request from the CAISO an allocation of TP  
25  
<!-- Page 35 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

Deliverability for the Project, which may be submitted as part of a request by Seller or its Affiliates for TP Deliverability for some or all of the capacity of the larger Grace Orchard Complex. Seller shall not be obligated to request an allocation of TP Deliverability for the Project more than one time, and such one-time request may be made before or after the Effective Date as long as Seller provides documentation to Buyer that reasonably substantiates the submission of the request. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that a certain amount (potentially as much as approximately 450 MW) of capacity at the Grace Orchard Complex is committed under offtake agreements executed before the Effective Date that may also require deliverability, and that such previously committed capacity therefore will have priority over the Project in apportioning any allocation of TP Deliverability for the Grace Orchard Complex. If Seller receives an allocation of TP Deliverability that can be apportioned to the Project based on its relative priority as acknowledged in the foregoing sentence, then Seller shall apportion such amount to the Project and notify Buyer of the amount of TP Deliverability that has been apportioned to the Project (the “Project Allocation Amount”). If Seller has not received an allocation of TP Deliverability for the Project by June 1, 2025, then Seller shall not have any further obligation to seek an allocation of TP Deliverability for the Project and the Products shall consist only of Energy and associated Environmental Attributes (not to exceed the Energy and associated Environmental Attributes available from the Contract Capacity), and Ancillary Services to the extent available from the Project without additional cost to Seller, and shall not include Capacity Attributes.

2.2 Products Purchased

2.2.1 Obligation to Deliver

During the Delivery Term, Seller shall sell and deliver, or cause to be delivered, and Buyer shall purchase and receive, or cause to be received, all Products supplied by the Project.

(a) Energy shall be supplied only from the Project, and shall be supplied from the Project whenever available. Seller agrees to sell to Buyer the Energy in kilowatt-hours, net of Integral Station Service Load and transformation and transmission losses to the Delivery Point.

(b) Any Capacity Attributes available from the Project and included in the Products pursuant to Section 2.1 shall be supplied only from the Project, and shall be supplied from the Project in the quantities available under applicable counting rules for resource adequacy, up to the applicable.

(c) All Products delivered by Seller to Buyer hereunder shall be a sale made at wholesale.

2.2.2 No Product Substitution  
Except as provided in Section 2.4.4, in no event shall Seller have the right to procure any Energy, Environmental Attributes, or Capacity Attributes from sources other than the Project for sale or delivery of Products to Buyer under this Agreement or to substitute any Energy, Environmental Attributes, or Capacity Attributes from sources other than the Project for delivery to Buyer hereunder.

2.2.3 Energy Produced Prior to COD  
Prior to COD Buyer shall not purchase Products hereunder, and Seller shall have the right to sell such Products to a third party or into the CAISO’s markets and to retain resulting revenues for Seller’s own account.

2.2.4 Buyer Production Curtailment  
Buyer shall pay Seller for all Buyer Curtailed Production in accordance with Section 2.4 and Section 8.5.

2.2.5 Meter Data Access  
Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to read the Project’s meter data on a daily basis.

## 2.4 Payments and Charges

### 2.4.1 Monthly Energy Charge

2.4.1.1 Buyer shall pay Seller the Monthly Energy Charge for each MWh of Production, plus, for each MWh of Buyer Curtailed Production during the applicable invoice calculation period, an additional amount equal to the PTC Amount calculated by Seller for the relevant period.

2.4.1.2 On a monthly basis, beginning with deliveries of Energy on and after COD, Buyer shall pay Seller (a) the “Monthly Energy Charge”, calculated as the aggregate sum over the Month of the product of (i) the Contract Price, and (ii) the Production for each hour during the Month, plus (b) for each MWh of Buyer Curtailed Production during the Month, an additional amount equal to the PTC Amount calculated by Seller for such Buyer Curtailed Production during the Month.

2.4.1.3 Seller is responsible for all losses from the Project to the Delivery Point, including transformer losses, which will be calculated in accordance with CAISO's requirements for accounting for losses.

### 2.4.2 CAISO and Related Charges

Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, Buyer shall be responsible for CAISO costs (including penalties, Imbalance Energy costs, and other charges) and shall be entitled to all CAISO revenues (including credits, Imbalance Energy revenues, and other payments), including revenues associated with Dispatch Instructions and other CAISO dispatches, bid cost recovery, or other credits in respect of the Product that is Scheduled or delivered from the Project. Seller shall be responsible for (a) all CAISO penalties resulting from any failure by Seller or its Scheduling Coordinator to comply with the CAISO Tariff or the outage notification requirements set forth in this Agreement, (b) any administrative charges, penalties, or fees assessed by the CAISO to the Project solely in its capacity as a generator in the CAISO market (including the Forecast Fee(s) and Grid Management Charge(s)), (c) any CAISO charges, penalties, or fees related to Seller’s failure to comply with a Buyer Curtailment or Dispatch Down Instruction, and (d) negative pricing consequences as specified in Section 9.1.2.3.

31
<!-- Page 41 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

any CAISO revenues related to Uninstructed Imbalance Energy shall be split equally between the Buyer and Seller.

The Parties agree that any Availability Incentive Payments (as defined in the CAISO Tariff) are for the benefit of the Seller and for Seller’s account and that any Non-Availability Charges (as defined in the CAISO Tariff) are the responsibility of the Seller and for Seller’s account. In addition, if during the Delivery Term, the CAISO implements or has implemented any sanction or penalty related to scheduling, outage reporting, or generator operation, and any such sanctions or penalties are imposed upon the Project or to Seller or its designee as Scheduling Coordinator due to failure by Seller to comply with the CAISO Tariff or the outage notification requirements set forth in this Agreement, the cost of the sanctions or penalties shall be Seller’s responsibility.

Subject to the foregoing, Seller shall pass through to Buyer all applicable CAISO costs and revenues associated with the Project, which shall be reflected as a credit or charge (as applicable) on the monthly invoices provided to Buyer in accordance with the invoicing and payment provisions of Section 3, including the netting provisions of Section 3.1.3.

**2.4.3 Timing of Imbalance Energy and CAISO Charges**

The Parties acknowledge that due to the CAISO settlement timelines, the above-referenced CAISO charges, penalties or fees in Section 2.4.2 will not be passed through to Buyer in the same month that they are incurred. Instead, Seller shall pass-through such charges, penalties, or fees after receipt of the settlement invoices from the CAISO.

**2.4.4 Adjustment for Non-Delivery of RECs**

In the event that (a) SMUD fails to receive WREGIS Certificates associated with the amount of Energy delivered to the Delivery Point (other than any WREGIS Certificates that are not provided due to any compliance or conformance issues resulting from Buyer’s assignment to a Limited Assignee pursuant to Section 20.3) within one hundred ten (110) days after the end of the Month that the Energy was generated and delivered to SMUD at the Delivery Point, and (b) the cause of such failure is due to Seller’s actions or inactions that fail to comply with Seller’s obligations under this Agreement (subject to the exclusions

32
<!-- Page 42 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

referenced above, a “WREGIS Shortfall”), then Seller shall either (i) deliver to Buyer at no cost to Buyer, and Buyer shall accept delivery of, a quantity of Energy and PCC1 RECs equal to the WREGIS Shortfall (“Replacement Product”), or (ii) pay to Buyer a “Refund Payment” equal to the greater of (A) the PCC1 REC Price, and (B) the Contract Price, multiplied by the quantity of Energy previously delivered at the Delivery Point for which there is a WREGIS Shortfall (“Discounted Energy”). The “PCC1 REC Price” means the market value of PCC1 RECs of the same year that the WREGIS Shortfall is identified, determined by the average of three (3) broker quotes for such PCC1 RECs. SMUD will provide notice to Seller of any WREGIS Shortfall, including SMUD’s calculation and supporting evidence for such WREGIS Shortfall and PCC1 REC Price (including the three (3) broker quotes used to determine such PCC1 REC Price). Seller shall have the right to elect to provide Replacement Product, or pay a Refund Payment for Discounted Energy, in its sole discretion. If Seller elects to provide Replacement Product, Seller shall provide written notification to Buyer of the time, physical location, and generating resource from which Seller will provide the Replacement Product; provided, that the Parties agree that the Energy from such generating resource shall be resold into a California balancing authority at the time of delivery. Any disputes with respect to the cause of a WREGIS Shortfall or the calculation of the Replacement Product, Discounted Energy or Refund Payment will be resolved pursuant to the provisions of Section 22. Seller shall deliver the Replacement Product or pay the Refund Payment to SMUD, or, if Seller elects to pay the Refund Payment, SMUD may offset and credit the Refund Payment against SMUD’s payment to Seller in the next regular settlement. If Seller cures a WREGIS Shortfall after Seller has delivered Replacement Product or paid Buyer (directly or through an offset or credit against a monthly settlement), then SMUD shall pay Seller the lower of the Contract Price or the PCC1 REC Price (as calculated above) for the Replacement Product, or refund to Seller all or part of the Refund Payment associated with such cure, as applicable, in the next invoice after such WREGIS Shortfall is cured.

2.4.5 Annual Production Guarantee, Project Performance Adjustment

Seller shall follow Prudent Industry Practices in operating and maintaining the Project and shall make any needed and commercially reasonable repairs. 

33
<!-- Page 43 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

identified through compliance with the foregoing requirements in a reasonably timely manner so as to maximize the Project’s availability for generation of electricity.

Within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of each Contract Year, Seller shall submit records of annual Project curtailment data (including Dispatch Down Periods, Buyer Curtailed Production, and other Deemed Delivered Energy) and any record of Force Majeure or Buyer’s failure to perform in a manner that directly affects the generation of Products by the Project, which Buyer shall reconcile with its own records of annual Project curtailment data (including Dispatch Down Periods, Buyer Curtailed Production, Deemed Delivered Energy, Force Majeure, and any such Buyer failure), in order to calculate AAEP.

If, at the end of any Contract Year, the AAEP for such Contract Year is less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the AAEP for such Contract Year, then Seller shall pay Buyer liquidated damages calculated as set forth below, which, except as set forth in Section 10.1.2.4, shall be Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy in connection with Seller’s failure to achieve in any Contract Year an AAEP that is equal to or greater than eighty five- percent (85%) of the AAEP for such Contract Year.

Liquidated damages shall equal: [(A – B) * (C – D)], where:

A = Eighty-five percent (85%) of the AAEP for such Contract Year, in MWh;

B = the AAEP for such Contract Year, in MWh;

C = the replacement price for the Contract Year, in $/MWh, which is the sum of (a) the simple average of the Integrated Forward Market hourly price in the Contract Year, as published by the CAISO, for the Existing Zone Generation Trading Hub (as defined in the CAISO Tariff) for the Delivery Point, plus (b) the market value of Replacement Green Attributes, based on the average of three (3) broker quotes; and

D = the Contract Price, in $/MWh

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no payment shall be due from Seller under this Section 2.4.5 if (i) the calculation of (A - B) or (C - D) yields a

34
<!-- Page 44 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

negative number, or (ii) the result of the calculation of [(A – B) * (C – D)] results in a dollar amount that exceeds 100% percent of the Monthly Energy Charges paid by Buyer to Seller for the Contract Year for which the calculation is performed.

2.4.6 System Losses  
All Products specified herein are amounts as provided at the Delivery Point, and Seller is responsible for all losses to the Delivery Point.

2.4.7 Title and Risk of Loss  
Title to and risk of loss related to the Products produced from the Project shall transfer from Seller to Buyer at the Delivery Point, except that title to RECs shall transfer when the associated WREGIS Certificates are transferred to Buyer’s WREGIS account. Seller warrants that it shall deliver to Buyer all Products from the Project free and clear of all liens, security interests, claims and encumbrances, or any interest therein or thereto by any person.

2.5 Energy Market Participation  
The Parties acknowledge and agree that as of the date hereof, SMUD is participating in the EIM and/or other energy markets. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, SMUD’s joining or continued participation in such markets shall not require Seller to perform any additional measures or incur any additional or increased cost other than administrative expenses, liability or obligation, in each case other than what Seller is already otherwise expressly obligated under this Agreement to perform or incur, unless compensated by SMUD. If in the future, market rules or policies change, then the Parties shall meet and confer to discuss the new market rules and whether updates to the scheduling, settlements, or other procedures are required and to preserve the economic “benefit of the bargain” to both Parties to this Agreement.

The Parties agree that expenditures to comply with the requirements of Sections 4.1 through 4.8 and Sections 5.1 through 5.3 are “Compliance Expenditures” and that the Compliance Expenditures that Seller shall be required to bear during the Term of this Agreement shall be capped at a total of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000) per Contract Year and one million two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($1,250,000) in the aggregate over the Term (“Compliance Expenditure Cap”).

## 4.9.2 Change in Law
If a change in Law occurs after the Effective Date that affects Seller’s compliance with its obligations under any of Sections 4.1 through 4.8 and Sections 5.1 through 5.3, Seller shall not be in breach of such obligations if Seller has used commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such change in Law as it pertains to such obligations. For purposes of this Section 4.9, the term “commercially reasonable efforts” shall not require additional out-of-pocket expenditures in the aggregate in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap in complying with the changes in Law described in this Section 4.9 unless Buyer and Seller have agreed in writing for Buyer to reimburse Seller for or to pay directly such excess expenditures.

## 4.9.3 Excess Compliance Expenditures
### 4.9.3.1
Within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, Seller shall provide Buyer with a report describing the Compliance Expenditures that Seller incurred during that calendar quarter and the total Compliance Expenditures incurred during the Contract Year that includes such calendar quarter. Prior to incurring Compliance Expenditures that are anticipated to exceed the Compliance Expenditure Cap in any Contract Year or over the Term, Seller shall notify Buyer of the expected Compliance Expenditures. Following such notice, the Parties shall attempt to agree to limit such Compliance Expenditures to the extent practicable; provided, however, that nothing herein limits Seller’s right to incur Compliance Expenditures that Seller believes in good faith must be incurred for Seller to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, as long as the above notification provisions are met.

### 4.9.3.2
If Seller determines that Compliance Expenditures in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap will have to be incurred, then Seller shall notify Buyer and provide documentation and calculations to support the expected expenditures.

excess Compliance Expenditures. Buyer may then: (1) approve the expected excess Compliance Expenditures and notify Seller of such approval, and Seller shall comply upon receipt of notice of Buyer’s approval and Buyer’s payment to Seller for the expected excess Compliance Expenditures; or (2) elect not to pay Seller for the expected excess Compliance Expenditures and notify Seller of such decision, in which case this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and Seller shall continue to be excused from performing or meeting any obligation that causes, or would cause, the incurrence of such Compliance Expenditures in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap, and Buyer shall pay Seller the Contract Price in full notwithstanding any such non-performance or non-compliance. Buyer is not required to reimburse Seller for any Compliance Expenditures unless and until Buyer agrees to the expected Compliance Expenditures in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap and, if Buyer elects not to reimburse Seller for any such Compliance Expenditures, then Seller shall be excused from performing or meeting any obligation in this Agreement that requires Seller’s payment or incurrence of such unreimbursed Compliance Expenditures in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap. For avoidance of doubt, if a Change in Law makes it infeasible for Seller to comply with its obligations under this Section 4.9, and it is not possible to overcome the Change in Law through the expenditure of money, then (i) Seller shall be excused from the corresponding Compliance Actions under this Agreement, and (ii) Buyer shall continue to pay Seller under this Agreement without any reduction in revenues that otherwise would result from the Change in Law.

## 5. CONVEYANCE OF CAPACITY ATTRIBUTES

### 5.1 Conveyance of Capacity Attributes
If Capacity Attributes are included in the Products pursuant to Section 2.1, then Seller shall provide to Buyer any attestation that Buyer reasonably requires in order for Buyer to show evidence that it has procured the Capacity Attributes associated with the Project in accordance with the procedure in Exhibit F. At Buyer’s request, Seller shall execute such documents and instruments as may be reasonably required to affect recognition and transfer of the Capacity Attributes.

### 5.2 Reporting of Ownership of Capacity Attributes
If Capacity Attributes are included in the Products pursuant to Section 2.1, then Seller shall not report to any person or entity that the Capacity Attributes sold and conveyed hereunder to Buyer belong to anyone other than Buyer, and Buyer may report under any such program that such Capacity Attributes purchased hereunder belong to it.

succeeding Contract Year period after the Contract Year in which the Cure Plan is implemented (or, if the Event of Default was caused by a Transformer Failure or Serial Defect, the two succeeding Contract Year period after the two Contract Year period in which the Cure Plan is implemented) to equal or exceed eighty-five percent (85%) of the applicable Adjusted MAEP (decreased as set forth in Section 10.1.2.4 above);

(e) Any disagreements regarding the Cure Plan will be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions in Section 22 hereof; and

(f) For avoidance of doubt, Buyer’s termination rights under Section 10.1.2.4 relating to performance during the two consecutive Contract Year period are not waived during the period when the Cure Plan is being developed and implemented, and if Seller does not meet an Adjusted AEP of at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the Adjusted MAEP in the next two consecutive Contract Year period (i.e. the two Contract Years after the Contract Year in which the Cure Plan is implemented, or, if the Event of Default was caused by a Transformer Failure or Serial Defect, the two Contract Year after the two Contract Year period in which the Cure Plan is implemented), then Buyer may terminate this Agreement under Section 10.2 with no further Cure Plan period and no further deferment of time of termination;

10.1.2.6 With respect to any Surety Bond provided for the benefit of Buyer, the failure by Seller to provide for the benefit of Buyer either (1) cash, (2) a replacement Surety Bond from a different Surety Bond Provider, or (3) a replacement Letter of Credit from an issuer meeting the criteria set forth in the definition of Qualified Issuer, in each case, in the amount required hereunder within ten (10) Business Days after Seller receives notice of the occurrence of any of the following events:

(b) the failure of the Surety Bond Provider to make any payment required in connection with this Agreement;

(e) the Surety Bond Provider shall repudiate, disaffirm, disclaim, or reject, in whole or in part, or challenge the validity of any Surety Bond.

## 10.2 Declaration of an Event of Default

If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the other Party (“Non-Defaulting Party”) shall have the right to: (a) send notice, designating a day, no earlier than five calendar days after such notice is deemed to be received and no later than twenty (20) calendar days after such notice is deemed to be received, as an early termination date of this Agreement (“Early Termination Date”) unless the Parties have agreed to resolve the circumstances giving rise to the Event of Default; (b) accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties; and (c) terminate this Agreement and end the Delivery Term effective as of the Early Termination Date. For all claims, causes of action and damages with respect to an Event of Default, in addition to the right to terminate this Agreement, the Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled to recover actual damages allowed by law unless otherwise limited by this Agreement. Neither the enumeration of Events of Default in Section 10.1, nor the termination of this Agreement by a Non-Defaulting Party, shall limit the right of a Non-Defaulting Party to rights and remedies available at law, including claims for breach of contract or failure to perform by the other Party and for direct damages incurred by the Non-Defaulting Party as a result of the termination of this Agreement, subject in each case to any limitations in this Agreement.

## 10.3 Termination Payment Calculation

If an Event of Default occurs, ultimately resulting in termination of the Agreement, a “Termination Payment” shall be determined in accordance with this Section 10.3.

The “Termination Payment” payable by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party shall equal: (i) Non-Defaulting Party’s Loss as calculated under paragraph (a) below and discounted to present value as set forth under paragraph (b) below; plus (ii) Non-Defaulting Party’s Cost as calculated under paragraph (c) below; which will then be

57
<!-- Page 67 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

aggregated with any amounts owed to the Non-Defaulting Party as of the Early Termination Date and any set-offs to which Defaulting Party is entitled as set forth under paragraph (d) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the sum of the amounts calculated under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) below would be less than zero (i.e., if the calculation of the Non-Defaulting Party’s Loss plus its Costs yields a negative number under the calculation below), then the result of that calculation shall be deemed to be zero.

(a) The Parties intend that Non-Defaulting Party’s “Loss” shall be the economic loss (exclusive of Costs), if any, resulting from the termination of the Agreement, determined in a commercially reasonable manner as calculated in accordance with this Section 10.3. The Loss, if any, suffered by Non-Defaulting Party shall be determined by comparing the value of the remaining term, applying the Expected Annual Energy Production (EAEP) and the Contract Price for each year of the remaining term under the Agreement had it not been terminated to the equivalent quantity and each party obtaining, in good faith and from non-affiliated market participants in the relevant market, two quotes for prices of CA RPS PCC 1 bundled renewable energy and RECs for the affected period of a similar quality and quantity in the geographical location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point and averaging the four quotes. If either Party fails to provide two quotes then the average of the other party’s two quotes shall determine the replacement price. For clarity, if Buyer is the Non-Defaulting Party, the Non-Defaulting Party’s Loss equals the amount by which the market price of replacement Energy and Environmental Attributes exceeds the Contract Price therefor, and if the Seller is the Non-Defaulting Party, the Non-Defaulting Party’s Loss equals (A) the amount by which the Contract Price hereunder exceeds the market price of such Energy and Environmental Attributes, plus (B) the value of lost Production Tax Credits that Seller would have earned on such Energy and Environmental Attributes for the relevant years of the remaining term applying the Expected Annual Energy Production (EAEP) for each year of the remaining term, under Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the U.S. Code, Section 45 and Section 45Y), less any expenses saved by Seller due to Buyer’s default, which includes, but is not limited to, any cost of production of the Energy and Environmental Attributes not incurred by Seller. To ascertain the market price of a replacement contract, Non-Defaulting Party may consider, among other valuations, quotations from leading dealers in ERR contracts, and other bona fide third party offers, all adjusted for the length of the remaining term and differences in transmission. It is expressly agreed that the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to enter into replacement transactions in order to determine the Termination Payment. 

58
<!-- Page 68 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

(b) The Loss calculated under paragraph (a) above shall be discounted to present value using the Present Value Rate as of the time of termination (to take into account the period between the time notice of termination was effective and when such amount would have otherwise been due pursuant to this Agreement).

(c) The Non-Defaulting Party’s “Costs” shall be calculated as the sum of the brokerage fees, commissions and other similar transaction costs and expenses reasonably incurred in terminating and replacing the Agreement, including reasonable transmission costs associated with any replacement contract, and reasonable attorneys’ fees, if any, incurred in connection with Non-Defaulting Party enforcing its rights with regard to the Agreement. Non-Defaulting shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate or eliminate Costs.

(d) The Non-Defaulting Party shall add any amounts owed by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party as of the Early Termination Date to, and shall set-off any amounts owing by the Non-Defaulting Party as of the Early Termination Date, against the Termination Payment so that all such amounts are aggregated and/or netted to a single amount. The net amount due shall be paid within thirty (30) Business Days following the effective date of termination, or, if the Parties disagree regarding the calculation of the Termination Payment pursuant to Section 10.4 below, the date that the Parties agree on the Termination Payment.

(e) In no event, however, shall the calculation of Loss or Costs include any penalties or similar charges imposed by the Non-Defaulting Party.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) Seller’s aggregate liability under this Agreement prior to the Commercial Operation Date, including arising out of a termination of this Agreement, shall not exceed an amount equal to the Damage Payment, and (ii) if an Event of Default by Seller has occurred prior to the Commercial Operation Date, and Buyer has not provided any reply regarding such Event of Default within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such Event of Default by Seller, then, provided such Event of Default is then continuing, Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and pay the Damage Payment then owing hereunder to Buyer.

(g) Payment by the Defaulting Party of the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, shall constitute liquidated damages and the Non-Defaulting Party’s sole and exclusive remedy for the Event of Default and declaration of an Early Termination Date related thereto, and further provided, promptly upon Buyer’s receipt of the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, Buyer shall return to Seller the Development Security or the Performance Security to the extent either of them, as applicable, did not comprise (i.e., was not used as) the Damage.

Payment or the Termination Payment, as applicable, and neither Party shall have any further obligation or liability to the other Party hereunder.

## 10.4 Disputes

If the Defaulting Party reasonably disagrees with the calculation of the Termination Payment and the Parties cannot otherwise resolve their differences, the calculation issue shall be resolved in accordance with Section 22 of this Agreement.

Seller shall have no obligation to replenish the Project Development Security after any draw thereon, no lien or other security shall be required, and Buyer’s recourse against Seller shall be limited to the Project Development Security provided.

Upon receipt of the Delivery Term Security, Buyer shall return to Seller the Project Development Security provided pursuant to Section 11.1. Seller shall maintain the applicable Delivery Term Security for the duration of the Term; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement, Seller’s replenishment obligation with respect to the Delivery Term Security shall be limited such that the total amount of any replenishments of the Delivery Term Security shall not exceed one (1) time the amount of the original Delivery Term Security. If Seller provides a Letter of
<!-- Page 70 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://example.com/image-url)

Credit, Seller shall renew or provide a new Letter of Credit or cash or a Surety Bond at least thirty (30) calendar days before the current Letter of Credit expiration date. A Letter of Credit must be in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit K-1 or any other form that is reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

11.3 First Priority Security Interest in Cash or Cash Equivalent Collateral

To secure its obligations under this Agreement, and until released as provided herein, Seller hereby grants to Buyer a present and continuing first-priority security interest (“Security Interest”) in, and lien on (and right to net against), and assignment of, as applicable, the Project Development Security and Delivery Term Security, to the extent provided in the form of cash, and any other cash collateral and cash equivalent collateral posted pursuant to Sections 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3, and any and all interest thereon or proceeds resulting therefrom or the liquidation thereof, whether now or hereafter held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of Buyer, and Seller agrees to take all action as reasonably requires in order to perfect the Security Interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), such collateral and any and all proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof.

(a) Exercise any of its rights and remedies with respect to the Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security as applicable, including any such rights and remedies under Law then in effect;

(b) Draw on any outstanding Letter of Credit issued for its benefit and retain any cash held by Buyer as Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security, as applicable; and

(c) Liquidate all Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security (as applicable) then held by or for the benefit of Buyer free from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of Seller, including any equity or right of purchase or redemption by Seller.

Buyer shall apply the proceeds of the collateral realized upon the exercise of any such rights or remedies to reduce Seller’s obligations under this Agreement (Seller remains liable for any amounts owing to Buyer after such application), subject to Buyer’s obligation to return any surplus proceeds remaining after these obligations are satisfied in full.

11.4 Letters of Credit

If the Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security is a Letter of Credit and the issuer of such Letter of Credit (a) fails to maintain the minimum Credit Rating set forth in the definition of Qualified Issuer, or (b) fails to honor the secured Party’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit by such issuer, then the posting Party shall have ten (10) Business Days to either post cash or deliver a substitute Letter of Credit that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Seller Letter of Credit or Buyer Letter of Credit, as applicable.

If the Seller or issuer of such Letter of Credit indicates its intent not to renew such Letter of Credit, and the Letter of Credit will expire prior to the end of the Term, the Seller will provide a replacement security prior to the expiration of such Letter of Credit.

12. FORCE MAJEURE

12.1 Effect of Force Majeure

62
<!-- Page 72 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

A Party shall not be considered to be in default in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than the obligations of a Party to make payment of amounts due under this Agreement) when and to the extent such Party’s performance is prevented by a Force Majeure that, despite the exercise of due diligence, such Party is unable to prevent or mitigate; provided the Party has given a written detailed description of the full particulars of the Force Majeure that are then known to the other Party reasonably promptly after becoming aware thereof, or reasonably promptly after the date that such Party should have become aware of, the Force Majeure) (the “Force Majeure Notice”), which Force Majeure Notice shall include information with respect to the nature, cause and date and time of commencement of the Force Majeure, and the anticipated scope and duration of the delay. Failure of the claiming Party to provide written notice as required in the preceding sentence constitutes a waiver of a Force Majeure claim for all periods prior to other Party’s receipt of such written notice. The Party providing the Force Majeure Notice shall be excused from fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement until such time as the Force Majeure has ceased to prevent performance or other remedial action is taken, at which time the Party shall promptly notify the other Party of the resumption of its obligations under this Agreement. In no event shall either Party be obligated to compensate the other Party or any other Person for any losses, expenses or liabilities that such other Party or such other Person may sustain as a consequence of any Force Majeure.

### 12.2 Meaning of Force Majeure

The term “Force Majeure” means any act or event, including any act of God or the elements, strike or labor disturbance, act of the public enemy or criminal activity, sabotage, war, terrorism, blockade, insurrection, riot, civil disturbance, fire, storm or flood, lightning, hurricane, tornado, ice storm, hail, earthquake, volcanic eruption, extreme or unusual weather events, explosion not caused by the affected Party, epidemic or pandemic and the efforts of any Governmental Authority to combat such events including quarantine, change in law or any order, restraint, directive, regulation or restriction imposed by Governmental Authority or any military or lawfully established civilian authorities, landslide, mudslide, New PV Trade Measure Event, WRO Restraint, a delay in the issuance of any permits needed for the Project, including any rights-of-way by the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management for any Shared Facilities to be used by the Project, or any similar event or occurrence (i) which prevents one Party from performing any of its obligations under this Agreement or

63
<!-- Page 73 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

delays such performance, (ii) which could not reasonably be anticipated (other than New PV Trade Measure Events and WRO Restraints) and/or avoided as of the date of this Agreement, (iii) which is not within the reasonable control of, or the result of negligence, willful misconduct, breach of contract, intentional act or omission or wrongdoing on the part of the affected Party (or any subcontractor or Affiliate of that Party, or any Person under the control of that Party or any of its subcontractors or Affiliates, or any Person for whose acts such Affiliate or subcontractor is responsible), and (iv) which by the exercise of due diligence the affected Party is unable to overcome or avoid or cause to be avoided; provided nothing in this clause (iv) shall be construed so as to require either Party to accede or agree to any provision not satisfactory to it in order to settle and terminate a strike or labor dispute in which it may be involved. Any Party rendered unable to fulfill any of its obligations by reason of a Force Majeure shall exercise reasonable efforts to remove such inability with reasonable dispatch within a reasonable time period and mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure. The relief from performance shall be of no greater scope and of no longer duration than is required by the Force Majeure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Force Majeure does not include any of the following (each an “Unexcused Cause”): (1) any requirement to meet a renewable portfolio standard or any change (whether voluntary or mandatory) in any renewable portfolio standard that may affect the value of the Energy purchased hereunder; (2) events arising from the failure by Seller to construct, operate or maintain the Project in accordance with this Agreement, unless such failure was itself caused by an event of Force Majeure; (3) any increase of any kind in any cost, except to the extent associated with a New PV Trade Measure; (4) delays in or inability of a Party to obtain financing or other economic hardship of any kind; (5) Seller’s ability to sell any Products at a price in excess of that provided in this Agreement or Buyer’s ability to purchase any Products at a price less than that provided in this Agreement; (6) failure of third parties to provide goods and services essential to a Party’s performance, unless such failure was itself caused by an event of Force Majeure; (7) Project or related equipment failure of any kind unless caused by a Force Majeure (8) any changes in the financial condition of Buyer, Seller, the Lender or any subcontractor or supplier affecting the affected Party’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement; or (9) a determination by either Party’s governing body.

12.3 Buyer Excuse
<!-- Page 74 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

For purposes of this Agreement, a Force Majeure shall be deemed to excuse Buyer from receiving Energy at the Delivery Point if the Force Majeure is not related to the Project, is declared by Buyer, and prevents Buyer from receiving Energy from the Project.

**12.4 Termination Due to Force Majeure Event**  
If based on a Force Majeure Notice provided by a Party (the “Claiming Party”), the other Party (the “Non-Claiming Party”) reasonably concludes that a Force Majeure or its impact on the Claiming Party affecting more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Project will continue (i) for a period of three hundred and sixty-five (365) or more consecutive days, then the other Party (the “Non-Claiming Party”) shall have the right to terminate this Agreement effective upon notice to the Claiming Party provided, however, that if the Claiming Party provides documentation to the Non-Claiming Party reasonably demonstrating that the foregoing more than seventy-five percent (75%) for three hundred sixty-five (365) days or more consecutive days standard is satisfied, and if the Non-Claiming Party does not provide any response to the Claiming Party within ninety (90) days after receipt of such documentation, then the Claiming Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the Non-Claiming Party. Upon any termination pursuant to this Section 12.4, neither Party shall owe any damages, Damage Payment, or Termination Payment under this Agreement in respect of such termination or the Force Majeure, and Buyer shall return the Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security, as applicable, to Seller. Any termination of this Agreement in the circumstances described in this section shall be without prejudice to the rights and remedies of either Party for defaults occurring prior to such termination, if any.

**13. INDEMNITY**  
**13.1 Indemnity by Seller**  
Seller shall defend, release, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives against and from any and all losses, claims, demands, liabilities and expenses, actions or suits, including reasonable costs and attorney’s fees, resulting from, or arising out of or in any way connected with claims by third parties associated with the acts or omissions of Seller, its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives relating to this Agreement; excepting only such

**14. LIMITATION OF DAMAGES**

EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT THERE IS NO WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE DISCLAIMED. LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT ACTUAL DAMAGES ONLY; SUCH DIRECT ACTUAL DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED.

THE AFTER-TAX VALUE OF ANY LOST TAX BENEFITS AND THE COSTS OF RECAPTURE OF ANY TAX BENEFITS OR CREDITS, IF ANY, ARE CONSIDERED DIRECT DAMAGES. UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, AND SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 13 (INDEMNITY), IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING THE

66

19. MOBILE-SIERRA

(c) Any assignment or transfer of this Agreement by Seller to a Person succeeding to all or substantially all of the assets of Seller, provided that such Person’s creditworthiness is equal to or greater than that of Seller, as reasonably determined by Buyer; or

(d) Any assignment or transfer of this Agreement by Seller to any assignee (including any Affiliate of Seller) that is a Permitted Transferee.

20.2.2 Change of Control  
Any direct or indirect Change of Control of Seller (whether voluntary or by operation of law) is deemed an assignment and will require the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a Change of Control of Seller shall not require Buyer’s consent if (i) the Seller after such Change of Control is Controlled by any Lender, (ii) the entity that is the Seller at the conclusion of the Change of Control is a Permitted Transferee, or (iii) such Change of Control is, or is a result of, a direct or indirect Change of Control of NEOP or NEP. For avoidance of doubt, a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred as a result of a Permitted Transfer, and no consent is required under this Agreement with respect to a Permitted Transfer.

20.3 Buyer Limited Assignment  
Buyer may request that Seller enter negotiations to permit Buyer’s limited assignment in connection with a municipal prepayment transaction of all or a portion of Buyer’s rights to receive certain Products (which shall not be for a retail sale, and which shall not include the right to schedule or dispatch the Project or any portion of the Product, or any right to act as Scheduling Coordinator for the Project or to offer any portion of the Product into the CAISO markets) and Buyer’s obligations to make payments for such Product under this Agreement to J. Aron and Company, LLC (“J. Aron”) or other third party at any time (together with J. Aron, each a “Limited Assignee”) upon not less than thirty (30) days’ notice by delivering a written request for such assignment. The limited assignment shall not introduce, or purport to convey or otherwise allege, any right of

![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

**Buyer or Limited Assignee** to make any prepayment to Seller under the Agreement or to file or impose any lien on the Project, or otherwise modify any provision of this Agreement, and shall be expressly subject to the Limited Assignee’s timely payment of amounts due under this Agreement with respect to the assigned Product. Buyer shall pay Seller for any payments not timely made by Limited Assignee, and Buyer shall remain obligated to perform all of its obligations under this Agreement notwithstanding the limited assignment, including any credit-related requirements, and payment for all amounts due and owing under this Agreement, including the total gross amount due to Seller under each invoice. Any failure by the Limited Assignee to make payments to Seller when due hereunder shall be a Buyer Event of Default if not cured within the applicable cure period specified in this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, following any request by Buyer, (a) Seller, Buyer and the Limited Assignee shall negotiate in good faith the execution of a limited assignment agreement based on the form attached hereto as Exhibit O, (b) if requested by Seller, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith an indemnity and/or a legal opinion, to be provided by Buyer for the benefit of Seller, in form and substance satisfactory to Seller and its Lenders (if any), including that Seller shall not be required to agree to any terms or conditions which are reasonably expected to have an adverse effect on Seller or its Lenders, and (c) Limited Assignee shall provide such credit support or performance assurance for its obligations as Seller may reasonably require. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in connection with such limited assignment, if (1) the assignment, transfer or conveyance of the assigned Product pursuant to such limited assignment, or (2) Seller’s performance of any obligation under the assignment agreement, fails to meet any requirements of this Agreement, then Seller shall not be deemed to be in breach of any obligation in this Agreement, including without limitation any representation or warranty herein. Limited Assignee and Buyer shall comply with all reasonable requests received by Seller or any Lender in connection with such limited assignment, including providing any reasonably requested acknowledgments with respect to any Collateral Assignment Agreement.

**20.4 Lender Accommodations**

**20.4.1 Consents and Estoppel Certificates**  
To facilitate Seller’s efforts to obtain financing to construct and operate the Project, Buyer will, as soon as reasonably practicable after a reasonable request, cooperate reasonably with Seller and any Lender to provide such consents to

assignments, estoppels, certifications, representations, information or other documents as may be reasonably requested by Seller or such Lender in connection with any financing of the Project, including in connection with any pledge of the membership interests in Seller or its upstream Affiliates to a Lender as collateral for a financing involving the Project. Upon written request of Seller, Buyer agrees to execute a Consent to Collateral Assignment among Buyer, Seller, Seller’s Affiliate, and any Lenders substantially in the form attached as Exhibit L, with such additional changes thereto as such assignee parties may reasonably request and as to which the Buyer shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its agreement. Buyer also agrees to execute customary estoppel certificates for the benefit of Seller and/or any Lenders as reasonably requested from time to time substantially in the form attached as Exhibit P, with such additional changes thereto as such Lender parties may reasonably request and as to which the Buyer shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its agreement.

## 20.4.2 Portfolio Financing

Seller may, without the prior written consent of Buyer, finance all or any portion of the Project, interconnection facilities, or Shared Facilities utilizing debt financing, equity financing (including tax equity), lease financing, or any other form of financing or any combination thereof, including pursuant to a portfolio financing of multiple energy generation, storage, and transmission facilities and other assets of Seller or Seller’s Affiliates (which may include cross-collateralization or similar arrangements).

## 20.4.3 Lender Cure Rights

Buyer agrees that: (i) Buyer will provide the Lenders with notice of any Event of Default by Seller; (ii) for a period of thirty (30) days following the expiration of any cure period for a monetary Event of Default by Seller and ninety (90) days following the expiration of any cure period for a non-monetary Event of Default by Seller, such Lenders, or their designees, will have the right, but not the obligation, to perform any act required to be performed by Seller under this Agreement to prevent or cure the Event of Default and such act performed by the Lenders, or their designees will be as effective to prevent or cure an Event of Default as if done by Seller; and (iii) Buyer will not terminate this Agreement if any Lenders have provided notice to Buyer that they must foreclose on the

2. **Representations and Warranties.** The Contracting Party represents and warrants as follows as of the date hereof:

   (a) **No Amendments.** [Except as described in Schedule I hereto,] there are no amendments, modifications or supplements (whether by waiver, consent or otherwise) to the Assigned Agreement, either oral or written.

   (b) **No Previous Assignments.** The Contracting Party affirms that it has no notice of any assignment relating to the right, title and interest of the Project Owner in, to and under the Assigned Agreement other than the pledge and assignment to the Collateral Agent referred to in Section 1 above.

   (c) **No Termination Event: No Disputes.** After giving effect to the pledge and assignment referred to in Section 1, and after giving effect to the consent to such pledge and assignment by the Contracting Party, there exists no event or condition (a “Termination Event”) that would, either immediately or with the passage of time or giving of notice, or both, entitle either the Project Owner or the Contracting Party to terminate the Assigned Agreement or suspend the performance of its obligations under the Assigned Agreement. [Except as set forth on Schedule III hereto,] there are no unresolved disputes between the parties under the Assigned Agreement. All amounts due under the Assigned Agreement as of the date hereof have been paid in full [, except as set forth on Schedule III hereto].

3. **Right to Cure.**

   (a) From and after the date hereof and unless and until the Contracting Party shall have received written notice from the Collateral Agent that the lien of the Security Agreement has been released in full, the Collateral Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, following an Event of Default by the Project Owner under the Assigned Agreement, to pay all sums due under the Assigned Agreement by the Project Owner and to perform any other act, duty or obligation required of the Project Owner thereunder as described in Section 3(c) below; provided, that no such payment or performance shall be construed as an assumption by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party of any covenants, agreements or obligations of the Project Owner under or in respect of the Assigned Agreement.

   (b) The Contracting Party agrees that it will not (i) terminate the Assigned Agreement or (ii) suspend the performance of any of its obligations under the Assigned Agreement without first giving the Collateral Agent notice and opportunity to cure as provided below. The Contracting Party further agrees that it will not assign any obligation under the Assigned Agreement without the prior consent of the Collateral Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except to the extent the Contracting Party may subcontract such obligations to other parties.

(c) If a Termination Event shall occur, and the Contracting Party shall then be entitled to and shall desire to terminate the Assigned Agreement or suspend the performance of any of its obligations under the Assigned Agreement, the Contracting Party shall, prior to exercising such remedies or taking any other action with respect to such Termination Event, give written notice to the Collateral Agent of such Termination Event. Collateral Agent will have the right, but not the obligation, to cure a Termination Event on behalf of Project Owner, only if Collateral Agent sends a written notice to Contracting Party before the later of (i) the expiration of any cure period under this Agreement, and (ii) fifteen (15) Business Days after Collateral Agent’s receipt of notice of such Termination Event from Contracting Party, indicating Collateral Agent’s intention to cure. If the Collateral Agent elects to exercise its right to cure as herein provided, it shall have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by it of notice from the Contracting Party referred to in the preceding sentence in which to cure the Termination Event specified in such notice if such Termination Event consists of a payment default, or if such Termination Event is an event other than a failure to pay amounts due and owing by the Project Owner (a “Non-monetary Event”) the Collateral Agent shall have a period of sixty (60) days after receipt by it of notice from the Contracting Party referred to in the preceding sentence in which to cure the Termination Event so long as the Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing appropriate action to cure such Termination Event within such sixty (60) day period despite exercising commercially reasonable efforts, not to exceed a total of thirty (30) additional days; provided, however, that (i) if possession of the Project is necessary to cure such Non-monetary Event and the Collateral Agent has commenced foreclosure proceedings, the Collateral Agent will be allowed a reasonable time to complete such proceedings, and (ii) if the Collateral Agent is prohibited from curing any such Non-monetary Event by any process, stay or injunction issued by any governmental authority or pursuant to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding or other similar proceeding involving the Project Owner, then the time periods specified herein for curing a Termination Event shall be extended for the period of such prohibition; provided, further, that in the event of items (i) or (ii) above, such time period shall not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days. Any cure period for the Collateral Agent shall not commence until the later of (i) the end of the cure period of the Project Owner under the Assigned Agreement and (ii) written notice from the Contracting Party to the Collateral Agent of a Termination Event.  
(d) Any curing of or attempt to cure any Termination Event shall not be construed as an assumption by the Collateral Agent or the other Secured Parties of any covenants, agreements or obligations of the Project Owner under or in respect of the Assigned Agreement.  
(e) Following a Termination Event by the Project Entity under the Assigned Agreement, the Contracting Party may require the Collateral Agent, if the Collateral Agent has provided the notice set forth in subsection (c) above, to provide to Contracting Party a report concerning:  
(i) The status of efforts by Collateral Agent to develop a plan to cure the Termination Event;  
(ii) Impediments to the cure plan or its development;

**FORM OF LIMITED ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT**

This Limited Assignment Agreement (this “Assignment Agreement” or “Agreement”) is entered into as of [___], 20__ (the “Limited Assignment Agreement Effective Date”) by and among [___], a [___] (“PPA Seller”), [___], a [___] (“PPA Buyer”), and [___], a [___] (“Limited Assignee”), and relates to that certain PPA defined in Appendix 1 hereto. Unless the context otherwise specifies or requires, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the PPA.

In consideration of the premises above and the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, PPA Seller, PPA Buyer and Limited Assignee (the “Parties” hereto; each a “Party”) agree as follows:

1. **Limited Assignment and Delegation.**

   a. PPA Buyer hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to Limited Assignee all right, title and interest in and to the rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA to receive delivery of, or have made available to it, the products described in Appendix 1 (collectively, and subject to the exclusions specified in Appendix 1, the “Assigned Product”) during the Assignment Period (as defined in Appendix 1), as such rights may be limited or further described in the “Further Information” section in Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Product Rights”). All other rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly reserved for PPA Buyer.

   b. PPA Buyer hereby delegates to Limited Assignee the obligation to pay for all Assigned Product that is actually delivered or made available to Limited Assignee pursuant to the Assigned Product Rights during the Assignment Period (the “Delivered Product Payment Obligation”) and together with the Assigned Product Rights, collectively the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”. All other obligations of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly retained by PPA Buyer, including without limitation payment for any Product which is not included in the Assigned Product and any other amounts (including without limitation for Deemed Delivered Energy) owed under the PPA. To the extent Limited Assignee fails to pay for any Assigned Product by the due date for payment set forth in the PPA, PPA Buyer remains responsible for such payment, and it will be a Buyer Event of Default pursuant to PPA Section 10.1.1.1 if PPA Buyer does not make such payment within five (5) Business Days of receiving notice of such non-payment from PPA Seller.

   c. Limited Assignee hereby accepts and agrees, and PPA Seller hereby consents, to the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delegation described in clauses (a) and (b) above.

Exhibit O - 1
<!-- Page 127 -->
![Exhibit O - 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Exhibit+O+-+2)

d. All scheduling of Assigned Product and other communications related to the PPA shall take place between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller pursuant to the terms of the PPA; provided that during the Assignment Period (i) title to Assigned Product will pass from PPA Seller to Limited Assignee upon delivery or making available by PPA Seller of Assigned Product in accordance with the PPA; (ii) PPA Buyer is hereby authorized by Limited Assignee to and shall act as Limited Assignee’s agent with regard to scheduling Assigned Product; (iii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to Limited Assignee of any Notice (as defined in the PPA) of a Force Majeure Event or Event of Default or default, breach or other occurrence that, if not cured within the applicable grace period, could result in an Event of Default contemporaneously upon delivery thereof to PPA Seller and promptly after receipt thereof from PPA Seller; (iv) PPA Buyer will forward copies to Limited Assignee of all invoices provided to PPA Buyer, provided that date is 10 days prior to the payment due date for a monthly invoice will be resolved solely between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller and therefore PPA Seller will not be obligated to deliver copies of any communications relating thereto to Limited Assignee. PPA Buyer shall promptly reimburse PPA Seller for any additional costs or expenses reasonably and actually incurred by PPA Seller as a result of this subsection (d).

e. PPA Seller acknowledges that (i) PPA Buyer and Limited Assignee have advised PPA Seller that Limited Assignee intends to immediately transfer to any Assigned Product received from PPA Seller through one or more intermediaries such that all Assigned Product will be re-delivered to PPA Buyer, and (ii) Limited Assignee has the right to purchase receivables due from PPA Buyer for any such Assigned Product. To the extent Limited Assignee purchases any such receivables due from PPA Buyer, Limited Assignee may transfer such receivables to PPA Seller and apply the face amount thereof as a reduction to any Delivered Product Payment Obligation; provided, however, that (A) at no time shall PPA Seller be required to pay Limited Assignee for any amounts by which any such receivables exceed any Delivered Product Payment Obligation, (B) any such application by Limited Assignee shall not affect any amounts due and owing under the PPA by PPA Buyer (which, for clarity purposes, includes any amount of Delivered Product Payment Obligation not paid by Limited Assignee as a result of any such application by Limited Assignee under this Section 1(e)), including under any invoice, and (C) at all times, PPA Buyer remains liable to PPA Seller for all amounts due and owing under the PPA, including the total gross amount due to PPA Seller under each invoice.

f. At least three (3) Business Days before the commencement of the Assignment Period, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Guarantor”) will issue, in favor of PPA Seller, a guaranty of Limited Assignee’s payment obligations under this Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Appendix 2 attached hereto (the “Guaranty”). PPA Seller may draw upon, apply, or make demand under Exhibit O - 2.

## Form of Guaranty

**[]**, 2023

**NAME**  
**ADDRESS**

Attention:

Ladies and Gentlemen:

For value received, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Guarantor”), a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, hereby unconditionally guarantees the prompt and complete payment when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations and liabilities, whether now in existence or hereafter arising, of J. Aron & Company, LLC, a subsidiary of the Guarantor and limited liability company duly organized under the laws of the State of New York (the “Company”), to **COUNTERPARTY NAME** (the “Counterparty”) arising out of or under the Limited Assignment Agreement among the Company, the Counterparty and [PPA Buyer] dated as of [___], 2024. This Guaranty is one of payment and not of collection.

The Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and notice of any obligation or liability to which it may apply, and waives presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any such obligation or liability, suit or the taking of other action by Counterparty against, and any other notice to, the Company, the Guarantor or others.

Counterparty may at any time and from time to time without notice to or consent of the Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder: (1) agree with the Company to make any change in the terms of any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (2) take or fail to take any action of any kind in respect of any security for any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (3) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company or others, or (4) compromise or subordinate any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty including any security therefor. Any other suretyship defenses are hereby waived by the Guarantor.

This Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect until the opening of business on the fifth business day after Counterparty receives written notice of termination from the Guarantor. It is understood and agreed, however, that notwithstanding any such termination this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the obligations and liabilities set forth above which shall have been incurred prior to such termination.

The Guarantor further agrees that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the guaranteed obligations, or interest thereon is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Counterparty upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or reorganization of the Company. No failure on the part of the Counterparty to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Counterparty of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power.

No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, waived or supplemented except in a writing signed by Guarantor and Counterparty.

The Guarantor hereby represents as follows:

(a) The Guarantor is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Guaranty have been and remain duly authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of the Guarantor's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, as amended to date, or any law, regulation, decree, order, judgment, resolution or any contractual restriction binding on the Guarantor or its assets that could affect, in a materially adverse manner, the ability of the Guarantor to perform any of its obligations hereunder.

(c) All consents, licenses, clearances, authorizations, and approvals of, and registration and declarations with, any governmental or regulatory authority necessary for the due execution and delivery of this Guaranty have been obtained and remain in full force and effect and all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental or regulatory authority is required in connection with the execution or delivery of this Guaranty.

This Guaranty constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with all of its terms and conditions (subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors’ rights generally).

**PRINCIPLES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT**

SMUD is committed to developing carbon free Renewable Energy in a manner that supports the community, protects the environment, and respects human rights. This document provides guidance on the key objectives that SMUD expects to achieve associated with this commitment. Renewable energy projects engaged in a commercial relationship with SMUD such as a Power Purchase Agreement will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, implement, and maintain throughout the Term, a Community Benefits Plan that addresses how the project will achieve the key objectives identified herein.

**Key objectives:**

1. **Land Use:** Prioritize previously developed lands. Avoid or minimize impacts on sensitive environmental resources, including but not limited to cultural resources, Tribal cultural resources, and biological resources such as endangered species habitat, vernal pools and other sensitive habitats, Waters of the US, Waters of the State and waters identified by CDFW as Streambed. Provide additional mitigation measures if avoidance and minimization measures cannot fully eliminate impacts. Applicants are expected to discuss these topics with SMUD and the lead agency as early as possible to identify potential associated issues in advance of the purchase power agreement being finalized.

2. **Land Use:** All projects should employ techniques for maintaining and/or restoring ecosystem function to the site in conjunction with Renewable Energy outcomes, including establishment of native vegetation, restricting use of herbicides and pesticides, use of grazing for vegetation management and seasonally appropriate maintenance practices. Where development is on or surrounded by agricultural lands the project should also employ agricultural practices on the property during operations including sheep grazing, dry crop farming and irrigated food production where feasible.

3. **Land Use:** Employ design and construction practices that minimize ground disturbance to the maximum extent possible. This is especially critical in areas where cultural, Tribal and biological resources are of significant concern.

4. **Sustainable Life Cycle Management:** Include plans for sustainable life cycle management of construction materials and project components during construction and operation that provides for recycling and reuse of construction waste and waste during operation including but not limited to the solar panels.

5. **Community Benefits:**
   (a) **Inclusive Economic Development:** Leverage SMUD’s Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) team to connect with certified small business vendors/contractors in SMUD’s service territory to support the project. Submit requests to seed.mgr@smud.org.

**Exhibit Q - 1**
<!-- Page 141 -->
6. **Zero Carbon Workforce Development**: SMUD seeks to galvanize and prepare the region for an inclusive, diverse, creative, and empowered future workforce. Leverage SMUD’s existing workforce development agreements, programs, and partnerships throughout the Project to support the development of a clean energy labor force. The Project Team will work with SMUD to engage various elements of the labor supply chain via pre-apprentice and apprenticeship programs, internships, informational sessions, and mentorship opportunities.

7. **Sustainable Materials & Equipment**: Sourcing materials and equipment from companies that have a human rights policy and statement of supply chain ethics commitment that expresses the corporation’s commitment to meet the responsibility to respect human rights and uphold ethical business practices in their operations and value chains.

1. \( C_t = \) module power temperature coefficient \((-0.xxx\%/°C, \text{ Weighted Average})\)  
   \( T_M = \) mean module surface temperature (°C)

2. A plot of \( P_{STC} \) vs. mean Reference Module irradiance is created as shown in Figure 1.

3. A linear fit is then performed for all Valid Data Points (shown in BLUE) while all other data points (shown in RED) are excluded from the regression. These RED data points represent discrete times in the data set where one or more event is present as defined in Section 5 Table 3 of this procedure. The coefficient of determination (\( R^2 \)) for the capacity regression shall be at least 0.92. The linear fit yields an equation of the following form:

   \[
   y = N * x + b
   \]

   where:
   - \( y = P_{STC} \) power (temperature corrected)
   - \( N = \) slope of the line
   - \( x = \) mean Reference Module irradiance (W/m²)
   - \( b = \) y intercept

   **Note:** A Valid Data Point is defined as an instantaneous, 1-minute sample of plant data which has not been excluded according to the guidelines in Section 5.

4. The Tested Capacity is determined by evaluating the equation at 1,000 W/m²:

   \[
   \text{Tested Capacity} = y(1000)
   \]
