# 2023 Customer Relations SD-5

**Policy:**  
“Maintaining a high level of customer relations is a core value of SMUD. Therefore, the Board establishes an overall customer satisfaction target of 95 percent with no individual component measured falling below 85 percent.

In addition, the Board establishes an overall customer experience “value for what you pay” target of 70 percent by the end of 2025 and 80 percent by the end of 2030, with neither the average commercial customer score falling below 69 percent nor the average residential customer score falling below 65 percent in any year.

**As part of this policy:**  
(a) SMUD customers shall be treated in a respectful, dignified and civil manner.  
(b) SMUD shall communicate a procedure for customers who believe they have not received fair treatment from SMUD to be heard.
