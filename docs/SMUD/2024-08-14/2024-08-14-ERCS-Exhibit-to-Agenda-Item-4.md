# SURPLUS LAND ACT

The Surplus Land Act defines surplus land only as “land owned in fee simple by any local agency for which the local agency’s governing body takes formal action in a regular public meeting declaring that the land is surplus and is not necessary for the agency’s use.”

The surplus declaration must be supported by written findings.

Surplus land may include both exempt and non-exempt surplus land.

Exempt land can be disposed of without making it available for certain statutory uses such as low- or moderate-income housing or open space.

# Basis for Exempt Surplus Land Findings

- The Code states that land less than ½ acre in size is exempt surplus if it is not “contiguous to land owned by a state or local agency that is used for open-space or low- and moderate-income housing purposes.”
  - RP s 082, 089 and 103 qualify for this exemption. Due to size and location, they are not well suited for Surplus Land Act designated purposes.

- The Code also classifies land as exempt surplus if transferred to a federally recognized tribe.
  - The miscellaneous parcel qualifies for this exemption.
