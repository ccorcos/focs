  - **Regulator/Meter**
  - **Residential Customers**
  - **Commercial Customers**
  - **Regulator**
  - **City Gate Station**
  - **Natural Gas Utility**

![Monitoring Technology Comparison](https://www.flir.com/discover/instruments/gas-detection/ogi-culture-of-safety/)

## Monitoring Technology Comparison

- **Ground- or structure-mounted or ground vehicle sensors**
  - Generally, most expensive ($40,000-$200,000) though some models of other types of monitors can be as expensive
  - Measurement range (typically up to ~40 ppm) reaches much lower than that for low-cost, portable, and hand-held sensors

- **Low-cost, portable, and hand-held sensors**
  - Cost ranges from $10-$2,000; as high as $30,000-$100,000
  - Typical range: 0 ppm to 1,000-50,000 ppm
  - Accuracy, precision, and sensitivity did not vary greatly from specifications for ground-based or stationary structures

# Monitoring Technology Comparison

## Drone-mounted monitors
- Generally, less accurate, precise and sensitive
- Upper limit of measurement range is similar to low-cost, portable, and hand-held sensors
- Costs not available

## Aircraft-mounted monitors
- Measurement range similar to ground-based vehicle and stationary sensors
- Cost ranges (select models) from $45,000-$100,000; similar to ground-based vehicle and stationary sensors

# Survey of Utility Leak Monitoring

## Number of Respondents
- 1 = Infrared cameras or other light-based sensors
- 2 = Portable/Hand-held monitors
- 3 = Ground-based sensors, whether mobile or stationary
- 4 = UAVs/drones
- 5 = Stationary air monitoring devices
- 6 = Enclosure sensors/alarms

## Common Leaking Components
- 1 = Compressors
- 2 = Condensers
- 3 = Valves
- 4 = Pipelines
- 5 = Meters
- 6 = Other

All respondents reported that stack emissions of CH₄ are estimated for reporting (e.g. GHGRP)

## How is it determined to repair or replace a leak?
- “All are evaluated and assigned a repair schedule according to the location and magnitude. Immediately hazardous leaks repaired same-day. Non-hazardous are assigned a 1-year repair schedule or re-evaluation schedule, or both.”
- “Unit start-up requirement.”
- “When alarm is generated.”

**SITE 1**
- Stack CH₄ consistently very low and close to detection limit at 0.3 ± 0.15 kg/hr
- Total fugitive leak CH₄ rate of 0.39 kg/hr (~0.0007% of average hourly natural gas fuel use from that month in a prior year)
- 4 of 6 flights aligned with ground-level & stack data. 2 of 6 flights had interference from nearby biogenic (confirmed by stable carbon isotopic analysis)

**SITE 2**

- CO₂ (kg/hr)
- Operating condition (instantaneous capacity factor)
- Mix of operational states: hot-start, ramp up and down, steady state

![Emissions for CNG Fueling Stations](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=Emissions+for+CNG+Fueling+Stations)

**Graph:**
- **Title:** Emissions for CNG Fueling Stations
- **X-axis:** Measured flow rate (scfh)
- **Y-axis:** % of stations
- **Data Points:**
  - Blue line: Including compressor emissions
  - Green line: Without compressor emissions
- **Note:** 80% of stations have emission rates less than 10 scfh

**Mean Emission Rate by Component Type:**
- Fitting
- Threaded Connection
- Valve
- Open-ended line
- Flange
- Compressor
- All

**Notes:**
- Only leak indications or emission points above detection limit included
- Emission indications at compressors were a potential mix of vents and leaks; thus categorized separately as "compressor emissions"

**Footer:**
- Average of 5.5 non-compressor leaks and 0.8 compressor emission indications per station visit

## CEC Grant: Characterizing Emissions from Biomethane Facilities

- AB 32 Scoping Plan suggests GHG mitigation strategies for sectors including energy, agriculture, waste management. Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Strategy requires 40% CH₄ emission reduction from 2013 levels by 2030.
  
- Real-time direct and fugitive GHG and air pollutant emissions during operation, before and after capture
  
- Apply flux chambers, mobile lab, UAV curtain techniques

## Relevant Federal Actions

**Upstream CH₄ reductions & reporting changes will help downstream users**

- **Regulation: EPA Final O&G Rule (May ‘24)**
  - Allows advanced monitoring techniques; will improve accuracy and source category breadth
  - Superemitter program from high altitude/satellite data
  - Add/revise calculations to improve accuracy, include empirical data
  - Reporting requirements to collect verification data, ensure accurate reporting, and improve the transparency

- **Investment**
  - DOE $850M to reduce emissions from small operators, repair low-producing wells, make empirical data transparent, enhance source quantification

---

## Other Research Needs

**Scope 3 Emissions Remain a Challenge to Identify and Quantify**

- E.g., upstream fuel extraction, processing and transport for fuels consumed by electric generation
- Allocation of suppliers’ emission sources to customer use, and boundaries, not always documented
- Supplier-specific harder to acquire than general averages
- PPA fuel or electricity can be unspecified, with high uncertainty

**Many Unknowns Remain in Methane Emission Identification, Quantification and Mitigation**

**CLIMATE IMPACTS**
- H₂ emissions can indirectly affect global warming  
  ○ More O₃, Strat. H₂O  
  ○ Longer CH₄ life  
- GWP₁₀₀ of 11.6 ± 2.8  
- Differing perspectives on the net impacts of H₂ emissions  
  ○ H₂ emission rates  
  ○ Upstream CH₄ leakage  

**EMISSIONS DATA**
- Very little data exists on H₂ leakage and/or venting rates  
  ○ Estimates, simulations & assumptions put it at 0.2-30%  
  ○ No empirical data  
- Lack of clarity of emissions along future H₂ value chain  

**TECHNOLOGIES**
- H₂ detection technologies are in their infancy  
- Existing tech is focused on safety  
- H₂ is hard to detect through conventional spectroscopy  
- Low-level detection and quantification critical to developing emissions estimates
