**System Overview**

SMUD owns & operates 76 miles of high-pressure pipelines located in Solano and Sacramento Counties.

The pipeline system is designed to move approximately 190 million cubic feet of gas per day.

Gas Pipeline Operations  
**System Operations**  
- The pipeline is a transmission system without compression, that is remotely monitored and operated.  
- Information about the pipeline’s operating equipment and parameters is communicated through a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) System.  
- SMUD’s system is equipped with a Gas Leak Detection System (GLDS) that constantly checks pipeline volume balance, detects leaks and has remotely controlled shutoff valves that can isolate pipeline segments without sending personnel to the field.

## Pipes Act and Implementation

The 2020 pipes act mandated that by 2022 all natural gas pipeline operators would quantify their fugitive emissions, implement an emission reduction program and then quantify the results of their emission reduction program.

### Requirements:
1. Study Fugitive Emissions
2. Implement Emissions Reduction Program
3. Quantify Emissions Reduction
4. Adopt Advanced Leak Detection Program (Future)
   A. Suite of leak detection methods  
   B. Periodic and continuous
