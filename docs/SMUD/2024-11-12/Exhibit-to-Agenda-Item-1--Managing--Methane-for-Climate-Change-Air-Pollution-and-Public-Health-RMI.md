- Methane’s global warming potential over 20 years (GWP20) is >80 times more climate forcing than CO2.
- And after its ~one-decade atmospheric lifetime (where methane is >100 times more climate forcing than CO2), methane converts to CO2.

**Graph:**
- Observed Warming: 1.09 °C [0.95 to 1.20]
- Carbon dioxide
- Methane
- Nitrous oxide
- Halogenated gases
- Volatile compounds and carbon monoxide
- Sulphur dioxide
- Organic carbon
- Ammonia
- Black carbon
- Land-use reflectance and irrigation
- Aviation contrails

**Notes:**
- Mainly contribute to changes in non-CO2 greenhouse gases.
- Mainly contribute to changes in anthropogenic aerosols.

# Methane measurements from US O&G for use in models, fees, and policies

**One million** aerial site measurements taken from 15 campaigns over six US regions comprising 52% of onshore oil and 29% of gas production.

**Total estimated methane emissions range from 0.75% to 9.63%**

Weighted average methane intensity is 2.95%, three-times the national government inventory estimate.

Ancillary midstream facilities, including pipelines, contribute 18–57% of estimated regional emissions.

**Assessing Global Oil and Gas Emissions**  
The OCI+ quantifies and compares greenhouse gas emissions intensities from global oil and gas assets. Use this web tool's interactive features to see where GHGs are emitted and investigate ways to reduce life-cycle emissions intensity from upstream production, midstream refining, and downstream transport and end uses.

# Near-term methane mitigation opportunities

## Increase transparency:
- Identify where SMUD gas is procured from and quantify supply chain methane emissions using credible, independent data and analytics.

## Track methane:
- Detect and attribute business-as-usual and super-emissions, create regional methane inventory, spot and fix leakage, develop mitigation plans to curtail methane emissions.

## Establish voluntary markets:
- Participate in buyer-seller alliance using an independent, verifiable certification process to differentiate gas and grade it based on its emissions to incentivize rapid mitigation.

## Advance policymaking:
- Convert voluntary markets into mandatory performance standards, financial instruments, and update CA regulations (e.g., remove legacy methane exemption in local air districts so they can regulate O&G sources, add low-methane gas into LCFS).

## RMI and our partners are cutting methane.

### Update emissions inventories
Comprehensively assess and routinely update global methane emissions from oil and gas and waste.

### Use public platforms
Increase data transparency using models, measurements, and open-source analytics.

### Identify suppliers with super-emissions
Purchase satellite data that offers near real-time tracking of emissions and health hazards.

### Certify and cut emissions
Procure low-methane gas with its emissions openly and verifiably measured from O&G operations and landfills.
