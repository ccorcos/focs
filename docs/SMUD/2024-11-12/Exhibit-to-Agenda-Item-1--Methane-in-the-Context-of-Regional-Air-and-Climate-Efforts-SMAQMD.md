![Why do we care about methane?](https://www.smud.org)

- Biggest component in natural gas
- Second most prevalent greenhouse gas
- Very potent GHG (25-85X GWP<sub>CO2</sub>)
- Short-lived climate pollutant (~10 years)
- Controlling methane to reduce atmospheric warming
- Although methane is “exempt” compound - it has negligible reactivity to form ozone

CH<sub>4</sub>: Methane  
GWP: Global Warming Potential

![GHG & Methane – California Emissions](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=GHG+%26+Methane+%E2%80%93+California+Emissions)

**2022 GHG EMISSIONS BY SECTOR**  
371.1 MMT CO2e Total in CA  
- Transportation: 39%  
- Industrial: 23%  
- Electricity Generation (In State): 11%  
- Electricity Generation (Imports): 5%  
- Agriculture: 8%  
- Residential: 8%  
- Commercial: 6%  

**Methane less than 10% of Total GHG Emissions**  
**BUT ...**  
Global Warming Potential ~25-85  

**2022 METHANE EMISSIONS BY SECTOR**  
36.33 MMT of CO2e total for CA  
- Dairies: 43%  
- Landfills: 21%  
- Industrial & Miscellaneous: 17%  
- Other Livestock & Ag: 11%  
- Wastewater: 3%

![SMUD's Carbon Footprint](https://example.com/image.png)

# SMUD's Carbon Footprint
## Permitted Combustion Equipment

### Permitted Combustion Equipment Number
- Turbines: 11
- Boilers: 846
- ICE Diesel Prime: 48
- ICE Diesel Standby: 38
- ICE Spark Prime: 220
- ICE Spark Standby: 10

### Methane Emissions (TPY)
- Turbines: 1,965
- Boilers: 968
- ICE Diesel Prime: 54
- ICE Diesel Standby: 157
- ICE Spark Prime: 65
- ICE Spark Standby: 10

**Note:** Very few turbines account for 61% of methane emissions.

### Turbine Methane Emissions (20-year horizon)
- CH4 (Methane): 6,679
- N2O (Nitrous Oxide): 2,342

**Note:** Methane emissions even higher considering it is a short-lived climate pollutant.

**Note:** CO2 emissions are 4M tons/year.

![GHG & Methane – Local Air District Efforts](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=GHG+%26+Methane+%E2%80%93+Local+Air+District+Efforts)

- Local Enforcement of CARB Regulations
  - Landfill Methane Regulation
  - Oil & Gas Methane Regulation
- Air Quality Permitting
  - Stationary source permits focus on criteria pollutant control
  - Controls can also reduce methane emissions
- Tracking City & County Climate Action Plans

![Landfill Methane Regulation & Local Enforcement](https://example.com/image.png)

## Landfill Methane Regulation & Local Enforcement

### CARB Landfill Methane Regulation (LMR)
- Effective in 2010
- Reduces methane from landfills by setting standards to promote optimal management of landfills
  - Regular surface monitoring
  - Reporting requirements

### Sac Metro Air District Enforcement
- Heavily regulated source (federal, state, local)
- District issues local air quality permits
- District enforces CARB LMR
- Annual inspections and source tests at landfills

---

**Landfill Sites**
- Sacramento County Landfill Kiefer (Active)
- Elk Grove Disposal Site (Closed)
- Sacramento City Landfill (Closed)
- L and D Landfill (Active)

![Oil & Gas Regulation & Local Enforcement](https://example.com/image.png)

**Oil & Gas Regulation & Local Enforcement**

- **CARB Oil & Gas Regulation (adopted 2017)**
  - Reduces methane emissions from oil & gas sector
  - Requires sources to regularly monitor and repair leaks

- **Sacramento County Stats**
  - Dry gas production only
  - Five oil & gas companies with operations
  - 0.2% of active and idle wells in California

- **Sac Metro Air District Enforcement**
  - Annual inspections of local gas production facilities
  - Leak detection using infrared camera & gas detectors

**Gas production equipment & wells primarily located in south part of County**

**Map Legend:**
- Active Natural Gas Wells
- Idle Natural Gas Wells
- Compressor Stations (permitted)
- Compressor Stations (non-permitted)

![Dairies & Methane](https://example.com/image.jpg)

# Dairies & Methane
- Dairies and livestock are major methane contributor
- Five dairies operate under local air quality permits; four of them have onsite methane collection
- Account for over half of all methane emissions in California
- Strategies to reduce methane
  - Methane capture, i.e., anaerobic digesters
  - Diet Modification
- Sacramento County
  - Dairy & Beef production are in Top 10 Commodities for County

# Methane Hotspots Program

- State research project started in 2015
- Satellite and aerial flyovers “methane plume mappers”
- Detect methane hotspots from landfills, oil & gas and other sectors
- How is the data used?
  - Shared with facilities to quickly stop leaks
  - Local air district enforcement tool
  - Data informed state regulatory amendments

![Community-Scale Air Quality Monitoring](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=Community-Scale+Air+Quality+Monitoring)

- City of Sacramento and Sac Metro Air District partnership
- Block by block air quality mobile monitoring project
- Spring 2023
- Results show higher levels of methane emissions at street level
- But generally, concentrations are low

![GHG & Methane Federal Actions](https://via.placeholder.com/1365x768.png?text=GHG+%26+Methane+Federal+Actions)

- **Recent Supreme Court Actions**
  - Denied requests to stay EPA regulation to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas drilling
  - EPA regulation to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by power plants left in place

- **Federal focus on large methane emitters**
  - **National Enforcement Initiatives**: Tackling the climate crisis is EPA’s top priority with a focus on Oil & Gas and Landfill sectors
  - Finalized Oil & Gas GHG Regulation (May 2024)
  - New Standards for Landfills (2021)

- **Federal Inflation Reduction Act**
  - $1.36 billion in funding
  - Funding to reduce methane from Oil & Gas sector
