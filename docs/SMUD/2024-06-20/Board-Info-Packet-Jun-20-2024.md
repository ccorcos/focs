TO: Board of Directors  
DATE: April 25, 2023  

FROM: Claire Rogers CR 4/25/23  

SUBJECT: Audit Report No. 28007743  
Board Monitoring Report; SD-8: Employee Relations  

Internal Audit Services (IAS) received the SD-8 Employee Relations 2023 Annual Board Monitoring Report and performed the following:  

- Selected a sample of statements and assertions in the report for review.  
- Interviewed report contributors and verified the methodology used to prepare the statements in our sample.  
- Validated the reasonableness of the statements in our sample based on the data or other support provided to us.  

During the review, nothing came to IAS’ attention that would suggest the items sampled within the SD Board Monitoring report did not fairly represent the source data available at the time of the review.

1. **Background**  
   Strategic Direction 8 (SD-8) states that:  
   Developing and maintaining a high quality, diverse and inclusive workplace that engages and inspires employees to commit to SMUD’s purpose, vision and values is a core value of SMUD.  
   SMUD is committed to diversity and inclusion and will foster and support a workplace that values employees representing a variety of backgrounds, including but not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender, gender identification and/or expression, sexual orientation and identification, national origin, age, physical abilities, veteran status, socio-economic status, life experiences, talents, and thinking styles.  
   Therefore:  
   a) SMUD shall attract and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce.  
   b) SMUD shall promote inclusion and diversity and engage its workforce in activities that demonstrate and support inclusion and diversity across the organization.  
   c) SMUD shall engage its workforce in personal and professional development.  
   d) SMUD’s percentage of engaged employees as measured through the Engagement Index shall exceed 80%.  
   e) SMUD shall use a broad mix of communication and outreach channels to ensure its recruitment activities reflect the diversity of the communities it serves.  
   f) SMUD shall maintain and communicate written policies that define procedures and expectations for staff and provide for effective handling of grievances.  
   g) Annually, and consistent with State and Federal law, the Board shall receive a report detailing the demographics and trends of the SMUD workforce, the available workforce, and the Sacramento region. The report shall also provide information on veterans as a part of SMUD’s workforce.  

2. **Executive Summary**  
   SMUD is in full compliance with SD-8, Employee Relations.  
   The rapid pace of change in today’s energy industry and economy requires that employer workforce strategies shift in kind. SMUD has accordingly accelerated the rate at which we implement changes to how we attract, retain, engage, and develop our employees. After several years enhancing people strategies with better data and stronger partnerships, the 2023 outcomes in this report will illustrate early signs of the building momentum we’re experiencing within our programs.

4. Challenges  
As we continue to enhance our programs, we must consider impacts to bandwidth, program service level, and resource allocation so as not to impair employee engagement, customer experience, or our robust organizational culture. We’re mitigating these risks with an increased focus on cross-functional collaboration, improving the awareness of neighboring projects and appropriately committing resources.  

While improved data, tools, and planning are enhancing the line of sight into our changing workforce composition and we are beginning to note shifts, changes to our workforce make-up and future skill requirements will require a significant investment of time. We suspect tomorrow’s workforce won’t look entirely different from today’s. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the labor force is growing more slowly than in previous decades and remaining in the workforce longer.  

These trends, SMUD’s historically low employee turnover, and the realities of a fast-changing energy industry and economy indicate the need for a careful investment in both current and future priorities. As we continue to adapt, our goal is sustainable progress.  

5. Recommendations  
As reflected in this report, SMUD has achieved the goals set forth in SD-8 for ensuring SMUD develops and maintains a high quality, inclusive workplace that engages and inspires employees to commit to SMUD’s purpose, vision, and values.  

It is recommended the Board accept the monitoring report for Strategic Direction 8.

**Appendix**

**Recruitment**  
The Talent Acquisition team tackled an unprecedented workload in 2023, managing 801 hiring requisitions and screening almost 30,000 applications. External applications more than doubled from just under 12,500 applicants in 2022 to just over 25,000 in 2023! While this increase can be attributed to several multi-year efforts across SMUD and the region, we suspect a large portion of this success is due to our recruiters’ smart use of Circa - the third-party software solution we acquired in 2022.

In addition to traditional email blasts, job board postings, social media ads, and internal employee communication channels; we can now affordably and efficiently advertise jobs to partners, schools, and community organizations within a 150-mile radius via the Circa platform. We’re already noticing impacts to the diversity of our applicant pools thanks to this strategic technological investment. A marked increase in communities of color and females can be seen in the chart below.

**Applicant Demographics 2022 v 2023**

| Demographic                | 2022 (%) | 2023 (%) |
|---------------------------|----------|----------|
| 2 or more races           | 5.8%     | 9.0%     |
| Communities of Color      | 53.6%    | 62.5%    |
| Prefer not to respond     | 6.0%     | 9.0%     |
| White                     | 34.1%    | 30.2%    |
| Female                    | 5.1%     | 0.0%     |
| Male                      | 0.0%     | 0.5%     |
| Non-binary/Non-conforming | 0.0%     | 0.0%     |

Recruiters conducted more than 400 consultations with SMUD’s hiring managers last year to ensure a shared understanding of candidate qualifications. These interactions facilitated education to support transparency and consistency across the organization, mitigating potential for bias within the selection process.

Additionally, the Talent Acquisition team completed a series of efforts in 2023 to improve equitable access to job opportunities. These included:
- A “Brass Tacks” workshop to support internal career mobility at SMUD where employees learned about the gears that keep the hiring process moving (eligibility lists, job descriptions, the selection process, and more).
- A series of resume workshops to educate employees about screening requirements and stand-out application materials.
- Enhanced candidate support for job classifications that historically receive a high volume of applicants. Recruiters ensured improved access to these opportunities via timely and succinct social media announcements about resources, important dates, and capped application requirements.

**GM 24-073 SD-8, Employee Relations Board Monitoring Report Page 6 of 15**
<!-- Page 25 -->
- A collaboration with the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging (DEIB) Council and Subcommittees to establish Diverse Hiring Panel guidelines. These guidelines ensure interview panels at SMUD are both representative of, and educated in, the diversity of our organization and community.

**Early Talent Programs**  
Alongside Toyota, Paramount, Fox Corporation, and Intuit, SMUD was recognized by Interns2Pros in 2023 as a top 5 finalist for Internship Program of the Year. Here’s a sampling of the accomplishments that made this possible:  
- We touched 34 college and university events reaching nearly 3,000 students.  
- We increased face-to-face interactions with diverse college populations like career centers, clubs, and student groups.  
- We redesigned existing internship workshops and events to better meet the needs of our university partners. One example: the Talent Acquisition team designed and delivered a workshop titled “Through the Eyes of a Recruiter” to UC Davis, Sac State, Chico, Los Rios College District, UOP, and Sierra College to educate students on SMUD’s selection processes. To complement the training, they also provided student coaching on resume building and behavior-based interviewing.  
- We experienced a 50% increase in college applicants for the summer intern program. More than 1,400 students from diverse backgrounds competed for 25 coveted spots.  
- Those accepted tackled a variety of important initiatives, including contributions to biological field surveys for endangered species in SMUD’s Upper American River Project; cybersecurity tasks and help desk tickets; and support for SMUD Cares.  
- We also increased our on-site programming for interns, hosting numerous financial wellness workshops, coffee with executives, two Habitat for Humanity volunteer events, and a tour of the Sacramento Power Academy.  

The Early Talent Programs team also administers two annual community scholarships:  
- **Powering Futures**  
  21 scholarships were awarded in 2023, ranging from $2,000 for community college students to $4,000 for 4-year university students. Those with a demonstrated financial need pursuing majors related to careers at SMUD received preference.  
- **Powering Aggies and Powering Hornets**  
  These scholarship programs were established in 2018 to benefit 1 student each from UC Davis and Sac State. Eligible students who majored in a SMUD-related career field at UC Davis or electrical engineering at Sac State were selected by their respective universities. In 2023, the Powering Aggies winner was awarded $1,800 and the Powering Hornets winner $2,500.  

**Employee Onboarding**  
New Employee Orientation (NEO) is SMUD’s first opportunity to engage its employees. We refreshed this program in 2023 by returning to an in-person format and switching from a weekly to a bi-weekly cadence for improved class sizes and labor efficiencies. The money and time saved was reallocated to support additional program enhancements like sponsored cohort lunches, campus tours, and post-NEO check-ins. We recognize that continued communication with these employees is critical to making sure they feel supported and seen as newcomers to our workforce.

![Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging (DEIB)](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Diversity,+Equity,+Inclusion+%26+Belonging+(DEIB))

**Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging (DEIB)**  
The DEIB team drove improved structure and accountability in 2023, bolstering important work supporting trust, respect, and inclusion at SMUD. In January, they launched an official handbook to support the organization in creating, growing, and sustainably managing Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). The book includes templates and guidance on everything from budget and governance structures to cross-collaboration and metrics. ERGs are currently working to establish baseline data on topics such as representation, allyship, and participation. We’re looking forward to gleaning additional insight about our workforce with the help of these measures.

**SMUD’s 8 ERGs include:**  
- Black Employee Resource Group (BERG)  
- Asian Pacific Islander (GRAIN ERG)  
- Latinos Unity Network for Action (LUNA)  
- Military Employee Resource Group (MERG)  
- People Reaffirming Inclusion Diversity and Equality (PRIDE)  
- Women’s Employee Resource Group (WERG)  
- Young Professionals Employee Resource Group (YP)  
- Parents ERG  

Established in 2022, the DEIB Council is comprised of a group of employees across the enterprise acting on behalf of the SMUD to support DEIB initiatives. The Council advises, advocates for, informs, assesses and/or monitors the DEIB strategic plan, as well as provides recommendations to the DEIB Department on behalf of SMUD.

Additional structural enhancements were made to SMUD’s DEIB Council, whose role is to advise, advocate for, inform, assess and/or monitor the DEIB strategic process. Through the establishment of its four subcommittees in 2023, (Diverse Workforce, Inclusive Culture, Community Impact, and Equity), the council is now equipped to provide resources and recommendations to the Workforce, Diversity & Enterprise Partnerships group and DEIB team.

**Workforce Culture**  
SMUD’s most recent organizational commitments to a culture of inclusion were documented in our 2023 Inclusive Culture Implementation Plan. The first of two goals was to foster the norms and values of an inclusive culture within our core competencies. Last updated in 2017, we worked with executives and senior leaders to identify refreshed competencies reflecting the skills and behaviors needed to execute on our 2030 Clean Energy Vision. We added the competencies Values Differences and Instills Trust—both key components of inclusion.

The second goal in the 2023 Inclusive Culture Implementation Plan was to prioritize employee growth and development. We focused on a 5% increase in utilization of four key learning programs last year, and the numbers in the table on Page 4 of this report show the extent to which we exceeded this goal for all programs.

Our 2021 engagement results showed “My work gives me opportunities to learn and grow” is one of four questions that are strong drivers of engagement based on statistical analysis. While our last survey indicated that 73% of employees agree with this question, that score is 7% below the global average for our vendor. We look forward to revisiting this question with our workforce when we next survey them in fall of 2024.

**Corporate Learning**  
There are several indicators that SMUD employees are deepening their relationship to learning.  
- Employee mandatory training accounted for an average of 25 hours per person in 2023, but employees also averaged 45 hours of non-mandatory training.  
- 1,044 employees leveraged the LinkedIn Learning platform and completed courses totaling more than 2,917 hours. Unique users increased by 39%!  
- We also saw increased participation across several learning and development programs:

| Program                     | 2022 Participants | 2023 Participants | % Increase |
|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Learning at SMUD           | 2,458             | 3,236             | 32%        |
| Mentoring Program           | 32 mentor/ mentee pairs | 58 mentor/ mentee pairs | 81%        |
| Field Employee Learning     | 100               | 146               | 46%        |

**Leadership Development**  
To provide experiential learning opportunities that develop leadership, and support collaboration and philanthropy in the community, SMUD currently supports 9 different leadership programs: Nehemiah Emerging Leaders, WEI Business Acumen for Emerging Leaders, Asian Pacific Chamber Catalyst program, Leadership Rancho Cordova program, Leadership Elk Grove, Leadership Sacramento, Creciente Leadership Program (formerly Nueva Epoca), Leadership Folsom, and SMUD’s Building Leadership Talent program. A selection process is conducted annually to match applicants with a program that effectively meets their development needs and SMUD’s business objectives, and individuals that sit on selection panels are required to complete unconscious bias training.

![Wellness](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Wellness)

**Wellness**  
Our goal at SMUD is to create an environment where wellness is seamlessly integrated into our corporate culture, contributing to the overall success of our organization and the satisfaction of our employees. Health and wellness program participation increased by 4%, with 365 participants in 2023 compared to 351 in 2022. We continue to enhance our strategy with flexible programs supporting several aspects of social, mental, physical, and financial wellness.

- We implemented One SMUD Stroll – a scheduled walking event with SMUD’s Chief Diversity Officer where colleagues can casually convene, connect and converse with peers and members of SMUD’s leadership team at Headquarters and the East Campus Operations Center.
- ERGs sponsored 7 health and wellness-themed events throughout the year, including:
  - “Mental Health Awareness: Take care of you first so you can help take care of others”, a workshop hosted by the Parents ERG; and
  - “Stress Management through Bhagavad-Gita”, a South Asian Heritage Month event sponsored by the GRAIN ERG to share how spiritual teachings can help reduce stress.
- We re-introduced the employee vanpool program and on-site fitness centers, which were both suspended post-pandemic. Championing the needs of our hybrid workforce and commitment to financial prudence, we updated the operating models for both:
  - For $130/month via pre-tax payroll deduction, employees can join SMUD’s new vanpool program in partnership with Enterprise, which provides transportation to and from designated stops; participation in the Commute with Enterprise Guaranteed Ride Home Program; insurance through Commute with Enterprise; and roadside assistance.
  - Fitness Centers at both the Customer Service Center and East Campus Operations Center are now open with non-supervised, full access to equipment. Employees were previously charged a membership fee to offset the cost of staffing, but centers are now free for all full-time, part-time, limited-term and casual employees to use after completing a 10-minute orientation video and a release of liability waiver.

**Benefits**  
Our transition to a post-pandemic hybrid work culture ramped up in 2023 with enhanced policy and decision making. The Enterprise Culture & Change team conducted extensive research on remote work best practices, analysis of employee location data, outreach to over 40 Western Energy Institute members, and focus groups with SMUD’s directors to understand how remote work was functioning. SMUD executive leadership ultimately arrived at the decision that all employees would spend a minimum of 1 day per pay period onsite beginning in Q1 of 2024.

To make this possible, we updated SMUD’s remote work policy, planned for the space needs of approximately 400 previously fully remote employees, and sponsored brown bag lunches and training to communicate changes and expectations about the remote work benefit. As a hybrid organization, our goal is to intentionally promote in-person connections that build relationships and trust while continuing to enable employees to work remotely for part of their schedule. This hybrid approach provides flexibility that can be an important part of work-life balance.

**GM 24-073**

<!-- Page 29 -->
Other post-pandemic considerations in 2023 included a full return to office for in-person open enrollment – the first since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Employees and retirees had the option to meet with the Benefits teams in-person or virtually, or to continue using the Virtual Benefit Fair platform featuring guidebooks, plan summary documents, and the ability to send questions to our benefit providers. Staff also arranged for vendors to present on coverage options for each of their plans.

Two additional noteworthy accomplishments:
- We conducted 2 pre-retirement seminars to packed rooms in 2023. Pre-COVID attendance hovered around 30-40 people. We saw close to 90 attendees at both pre-retirement seminars last year, helping to reengage those who were previously unable to leverage technology.
- For another consecutive year, we negotiated an impressive medical renewal under 5% compared to the industry standard of 7%. Our staff remains committed to addressing the rising cost of health care.

Conduct & Grievances  
In addition to SMUD’s Code of Business Ethics and Employee Conduct, the Employee and Labor Relations teams provide daily guidance and counsel to ensure all employees (represented and unrepresented) understand SMUD policies and procedures, and their responsibilities with respect to the Code of Ethics. The teams resolved a total of 9 grievances in 2023, down from 11 in 2022.

SMUD Workforce Demographics  
The following chart provides demographic information about SMUD’s workforce (excluding “casual” positions and members of the Board of Directors). A thorough analysis of this data resulted in the following findings for 2023:
- A 0.6% increase in Hispanic employees
- A 0.4% increase in Asian employees
- A continued downward trend in the percentage of Caucasian employees

The cumulative impact of enhancements to our employee programs and organic turnover are the likely drivers for this change as SMUD continues to develop its talent pipeline and build a workforce that reflects the diversity of the communities we serve.

**SMUD’s Veteran Workforce**
Veterans are a small but important part of SMUD’s workforce, and in 2023, we attended 11 vet-specific events to help with tools to enter civilian careers. This included California Employment Development Department’s VetNet Series, Sacramento Veteran Employee Resource Groups, and Volunteers of America, where we assisted with mock interviews, resume workshops, hiring process questions, and information about SMUD programs.
<!-- Page 31 -->
![SMUD Veteran Demographics](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Veteran+Demographics)

We leveraged the Circa platform to complete outreach to 563 veteran organizations last year, sending more than 6,000 email announcements about SMUD jobs, and saw a 20% increase in veteran applicants (540 in 2023 compared to 434 in 2022). We ultimately hired 12 veterans, and SMUD’s vet population increased from 4.5% in 2022 to 5.2% in 2023. Per the Biddle Consulting Group, 6.7% is the national percentage of veterans in the civilian labor force.

**SMUD Workforce Demographics by Employee Level**

When compared to 2022 data, we saw an increase in female directors, supervisors, and staff at SMUD last year. This trend, combined with the increase in female applicants reported on page 6, indicate our targeted efforts to improve female representation are working.

| Employee Level | Male 2022 | Male 2023 | Female 2022 | Female 2023 |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Executives      | 60%       | 60%       | 40%         | 40%         |
| Directors       | 59%       | 57%       | 41%         | 43%         |
| Managers        | 62%       | 64%       | 38%         | 36%         |
| Supervisors     | 66%       | 62%       | 34%         | 38%         |
| Staff           | 67%       | 66%       | 33%         | 34%         |

**Additional shifts in demographics by employee level for 2023 include increases in:**
- African American executives, directors, managers, and supervisors
- Hispanic directors, managers, and supervisors
- Asian directors and supervisors
- Directors and supervisors of two or more races

As a note, this reporting remains dynamic in the sense that all demographics are self-reported and, while uncommon, employees can change their gender identity or ethnicity at any time.

| Employee Level | Caucasian | African American | Hispanic | Asian | Native American | 2 or more Races |
|----------------|-----------|------------------|----------|-------|------------------|------------------|
|                | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 |
| Executives     | 50%   | 50%   | 10%  | 20%  | 0%   | 0%   | 30%  | 30%  | 0%   | 0%   | 10%  | 0%   |

| Managers*      | 69%   | 70%   | 3%   | 4%   | 7%   | 8%   | 13%  | 13%  | 1%   | 1%   | 6%   | 5%   |

| Staff*         | 54%   | 54%   | 7%   | 7%   | 17%  | 17%  | 15%  | 15%  | 1%   | 1%   | 5%   | 5%   |

* Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.

**Workforce Turnover**  
SMUD’s turnover decreased in 2023 from 7.0% in 2022 to 6.4%, which we believe to be in large part due to fewer retirements. Retirements decreased from 78 in 2022 to 63 retirements last year. Our turnover continues to rank below the industry benchmark of 11.1%. While SMUD’s Baby Boomer workforce is entering retirement eligibility, economic influences are also affecting the average length of time a person may choose to stay in the workforce.

**Completing the Employee Lifecycle**  
To help identify strengths and opportunities across the organization, we introduced voluntary voice-to-voice exit interviews for departing employees in 2023. In the first year of the program, 88 employees elected to share feedback on their experiences at SMUD.

- 94% of all exiting employees would recommend SMUD to a friend or colleague.
- 90% of exiting employees would consider returning to SMUD if the conditions were right.
- Less than half of employees specified that they were leaving because they were dissatisfied with some part of their job - either promotional opportunities, remote work limitations, or work/life balance in their specific job.
- Most employees view the people they worked with at SMUD as the best part of their job and listed a substantial number of positive descriptors for them.
- Employees felt recognized and appreciated for the contributions they made to SMUD. There were many more positive reactions when asked this question than critical commentary.

There is a strong correlation with the information discovered through the exit interview process and SMUD’s engagement survey data, which senior leaders have been actively addressing since developing engagement action plans in 2022.

<!-- Page 33 -->
The 2023 separation data tells us that Caucasian employees represented 63% of departing employees, up from 60% in 2022. This shift was offset by an increase of 4% for Hispanic employees, a 5% decrease for Asian employees, and a 2% decrease for employees of two or more races. While we did see fewer employees leave SMUD in 2023 overall, we’re continuing to conduct a deeper analysis of this data to learn if correlations exist between specific populations and exit interview feedback.

Board Monitoring Report; SD-12: Ethics  

Internal Audit Services (IAS) received the SD-12 Ethics 2023 Annual Board Monitoring Report and performed the following:

- Selected a sample of statements and assertions in the report for review.
- Interviewed report contributors and verified the methodology used to prepare the statements in our sample.
- Validated the reasonableness of the statements in our sample based on the data or other support provided to us.

# Board Monitoring Report 2023  
## SD-12, Ethics  

### 1. Background  

Strategic Direction 12 states that:  

Maintaining the public trust and confidence in the integrity and ethical conduct of the Board and SMUD employees is a core value. Therefore, to ensure the public interest is paramount in all official conduct, the Board shall adopt and update, as necessary: a Conflict of Interest Code as required by State law. SMUD shall also maintain and enforce a code of conduct applicable to all employees.  

Among other things the code of conduct shall:  
a) Require high ethical standards in all aspects of official conduct;  
b) Establish clear guidelines for ethical standards and conduct by setting forth those acts that may be incompatible with the best interests of SMUD and the public;  
c) Require disclosure and reporting of potential conflicts of interest; and  
d) Provide a process for (i) reporting suspected violations of the code of conduct and policies through multiple channels, including an anonymous hotline, and (ii) investigating suspected violations.  

### 2. Executive Summary  

SMUD is in compliance with the requirements of SD-12.  

Strategic Direction 12 requires SMUD to have a process to report potential conflicts of interest and a process for reporting and investigating suspected violations of the Code of Conduct. Compliance is foundational for acting in the best interests of our customers and community. Several SMUD policies and procedures support the requirement of high ethical standards in all aspects of official conduct.  

| SD Requirement | Supporting Process/Procedure |  
|----------------|------------------------------|  
| a) Require high ethical standards | SMUD's Ethics policy (AP 05.02.03) sets the requirements and expectations for ethical behavior, including communication, training and other resources. |  

GM 24-074  
SD-12, Ethics Board Monitoring Report  
Page 1 of 5  
<!-- Page 37 -->
b) Establish clear guidelines for ethical standards and conduct  
SMUD’s Code of Business Ethics and Employee Conduct were updated and approved by the CEO & General Manager in 2020. SMUD’s Ethics procedure (MP 05.02.03.100) was adopted in 2008 and updated in January 2021. SMUD’s Conflict of Interest policy (AP 05.02.02) was adopted in 1998 and approved by the FPPC (Fair Political Practices Commission) in 2023.

c) Require disclosure and reporting potential conflicts of interest statements  
Notice of filing requirements were sent to employees as early as January and through March. 97.7% of the annual conflict of interest statements were received by the time this report was finalized.

d) Provide a process for reporting and investigating suspected violations of the code of ethics  
SMUD’s Whistleblower Anti-Retaliation policy (AP 05.01.03) was approved in 2014. SMUD’s Complaint Process Policy (AP 05.01.04) was adopted in 2006 and updated in August 2022. SMUD’s Ethics and Compliance Hotline has been in place since 2008.

3. Additional Supporting Information  
**Ethics Policy**  
In accordance with Board Policy SD-12 Ethics, SMUD developed the Code of Business Ethics and Employee Conduct, approved by the CEO & General Manager in 2020. This document supplements SMUD’s State-law mandated Conflict of Interest Code and provides an easy-to-read explanation of SMUD’s values and expectations for employee behavior. It also identifies various staff resources to obtain further guidance, as well as alternative methods to report suspected violations of SMUD’s Code of Business Ethics. The Code provides a framework for how employees should act toward customers, vendors and each other. It also emphasizes that as a publicly-owned utility, SMUD and its employees must adhere to the highest ethical standards.

All new employees receive a copy of SMUD’s Code of Business Ethics prior to or during new employee orientation and are required to review and submit a signed acknowledgement to People, Services & Strategies within 30 days of orientation. In addition, all contractors with unescorted access receive a copy of the Code when their background check is conducted. PS&S verifies Code acknowledgments on a quarterly basis to ensure signed acknowledgments are received from all new employees and contractors.

# Ethics Training

Ethics training is a mandatory requirement for all SMUD employees. They are required to complete the training every 2 years on a fixed rotating schedule. New and returning employees have one year for completion while newly promoted leaders are required to take Ethics training within 90 days of promotion into their role. Course completion is tracked using SMUD’s Learning Management System (LMS) and reported as part of SMUD’s mandatory training statistics. The 2023 completion rate for employees with 2023 due dates is 99.61%.

## Disclosure and Reporting of Potential Conflicts of Interest

The Political Reform Act (Cal. Gov. Code §§ 81000, et seq.) requires certain government officials and employees to publicly disclose certain financial information relevant to the scope of decision-making for their positions with SMUD.

To maintain compliance, all employees in positions designated by the SMUD Board must complete and submit an annual Statement of Economic Interests, FPPC Form 700 (Conflict of Interest Statement). Incumbents of designated positions shall file an Assuming Office Statement within 30 days of starting their employment or beginning the new position. Employees in designated positions who leave SMUD shall file Leaving Office Statements within 30 days of their final dates of employment.

The annual Conflict of Interest Statements are public documents filed with Corporate Records or in the designated record repository. PS&S sent financial disclosure materials electronically to designated employees as early as January and through March to successfully meet the FPPC filing deadline of April 2. At the time of this report, 97.7% percent of the annual Conflict of Interest Statements from SMUD officials and designated employees were received. PS&S staff follows up to ensure total compliance. In the rare event that full compliance is not achieved, SMUD is obligated to report violations to the FPPC for enforcement. This has occurred only two times in the last decade.

## Process for Reporting and Investigating Suspected Violations

SMUD holds its employees to a higher standard than that required by law and is committed to providing a work environment in which all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. SMUD encourages employees to bring concerns about potential legal violations or violations of SMUD policies to the attention of a SMUD leader. All SMUD leaders are required to immediately report all complaints they receive regarding suspected policy violations to the Fair Employment Office. An employee who believes that they are unable to make a complaint through their management reporting line may report complaints directly to the Fair Employment Office, Labor Relations, Internal Auditor’s or General Counsel’s Office.

Additionally, SMUD has contracted with Navex Global Compliance since November 2008 to operate an anonymous Ethics and Compliance Hotline. This hotline can be used by employees to file complaints anonymously should they so choose, either online or by calling Navex Global Compliance directly.

As part of SMUD’s Complaint Process and Whistleblower Anti-Retaliation policies, a Whistleblower Committee was established to review and act, when appropriate, on hotline/whistleblower complaints. The committee is comprised of representatives from the General Counsel’s office, Internal Audit Services and PS&S, including members of our Fair Employment Office and Labor Relations team.

![Discipline by Year Chart](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Discipline+by+Year+Chart)

In addition to investigating potential violations of SMUD’s Nondiscrimination, Anti-Harassment and Non-Retaliation Policy (AP 05.01.01) and Code of Ethics, Labor Relations and Fair Employment analysts also advise, consult with and support leaders on recommended action and coaching to address problematic behaviors and attitudes among the workforce that are not necessarily prohibited by law. This includes working with a leaders’ leader or senior leadership when improved leadership skills would benefit relationships. These proactive measures play a critical role in a culture where all employees are respected and valued.

The following chart illustrates discipline issued to employees between 2019-2023. Summarized below are the disciplines issued for violations of SMUD’s Nondiscrimination, Anti-Harassment and Non-Retaliation Policy (AP 05.01.01) as well as discipline for misconduct/policy violations under SMUD’s Positive Discipline Policy (AP 05.02.09) including dishonesty, bullying, discourteous behavior, unprofessional conduct, driving policy violations, insubordination, conflicts of interest and unethical behavior. The below reporting does not include discipline related to safety incidents (e.g. preventable vehicle accidents), attendance (tardiness and/or absences) or work performance unless there was a conduct component covered by SMUD’s Code of Business Ethics & Employee Conduct, such as wilful negligence or dishonesty.

The chart shown next indicates violations of SMUD's Nondiscrimination, Anti-Harassment and Non-Retaliation Policy (AP 05.01.01) as they relate to protected categories for FEO investigations that occurred in the past five years.

4. Challenges  
Completing training and obtaining necessary documents can be a challenge for employees on any type of extended leave. Broad or anonymous complaints are sometimes filed without supporting and/or contact information to allow for follow-up and further investigation.

5. Recommendations  
As reflected in this report, SMUD has achieved the goals set forth in SD-12 for maintaining the public trust and confidence in the integrity and ethical conduct of the Board and SMUD employees. The policies, guidelines, staff training and monitoring and reporting components have played a part in ensuring high ethical standards in all areas of conduct and in operations.  

It is recommended the Board accept the monitoring report for Strategic Direction 12.

# 1 Executive Summary

SMUD adopted a three-year Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) in 2023. This 2023-2025 WMP was a comprehensive update of SMUD's WMP and included a risk assessment, analysis on the impact of climate change, descriptions of prevention and mitigation initiatives, discussion of project updates and outcomes, and metrics to evaluate the WMP performance. This 2024 update to the 2023-2025 WMP outlines progress made on several multi-year projects and provides other minor updates to reported initiatives.

## Projects
The multi-year projects outlined in SMUD’s 2023 comprehensive update are complete or on-track with one exception. Although SMUD’s service territory is outside the CPUC’s High Fire Threat District (HFTD), SMUD has been installing Cal FIRE exempt arrestors, connectors, and fuses in the Pole Clearing Area (PCA). In late 2023, a manufacturer of a particular fuse holder halted production and shipments to utilities. This has caused a slight disruption in the overall project. SMUD staff and vendors are exploring alternatives in addition to working with the vendor to see if production will be resumed with a design change. SMUD staff have adjusted the plan to continue installing other hardware that have not been impacted. Overall project completion target remains the same, however, this target may be adjusted if hardware remains unavailable.

## Risk management
The bulk of SMUD’s efforts continue to be reducing fuel around our facilities to reduce ignition risk. Winter season arrived late in 2022. The late winter season allowed vegetation contractors to continue working in our highest fire risk Upper American River Project (UARP) area late into the fall of 2022, enabling us to get ahead of the scheduled 2023 work. As a result of this accelerated work, 2023 vegetation removal activities in the UARP concluded much earlier than planned. Earlier completion allowed SMUD to lower its wildfire risk in the UARP prior to the hot-dry months of August and September.

Northern CA has benefited from atmospheric rivers and snowpacks that have delivered above average rain and water totals in 2023 and 2024. The late wet winter/spring resulted in a shortened and mild wildfire season for Northern CA in 2023. The outlook for wildland fire potential in Northern California looks similar for 20241.

The various programs and projects described in the 2023-2025 WMP continue to provide a comprehensive and innovative approach to SMUD’s wildfire risk reduction.

5.1 CAL FIRE Fire Resource and Assessment Program (FRAP)  
CAL FIRE publishes multiple maps related to fire threat throughout the state. SMUD refers to the Fire Hazard Severity Zone (FHSZ) map for many years to inform and plan maintenance activities. CAL FIRE published new FHSZ map in April 2024. The new map depicts slight changes in fire hazard severity in the PCA. SMUD staff have begun the process of importing the map data. SMUD staff will analyze the impacts of the new map and adjust SMUD’s mitigation programs as needed. However, CAL FIRE has not published a new map depicting FHSZ for Local Responsibility Area (LRA) and Federal Responsibility Area (FRA). The LRA and FRA depict fire hazard within Sacramento County areas, and portions of the UARP where SMUD has transmission lines respectively. SMUD staff will continue monitoring CAL FIRE’s website for updates to these two maps.

Although SMUD takes CAL FIRE’s FHSZ mapping into consideration as part of its wildfire mitigation planning, SMUD’s Wildfire Mitigation Plan references the CPUC Fire Threat Map that focuses on the risk of utility associated wildfires.

6.2 Transmission grid operational practices

6.2.1 Disabling reclosing  
All Valley 115 kV, 230 kV and UARP 69 kV, 230 kV transmission auto reclosers are disabled and will remain disabled to mitigate wildfire risks. The disabling of reclosing follows fire season described in 6.1.1

6.2.2 Planned de-energization during fire season  
SMUD’s Power System Operators (PSO) have the authority to de-energize portions or all the Valley and UARP transmission line(s) for safety, reliability, conditions beyond design criteria, threat of wildfires and during emergency conditions when requested by local law enforcement or fire officials. Per existing protocols, planned de-energizations are coordinated with interconnected agencies.

During active fire season as declared by CAL FIRE the PSO is authorized to de-energize portions or all the Valley and UARP transmission line(s) when there is imminent fire danger, mandatory fire orders are in effect, and/or the transmission system is experiencing conditions beyond design criteria. The PSO will take a combination of many factors into consideration when implementing de-energization procedures, which include the triggers listed below, as well as power system knowledge and potential community impacts. De-energization decisions require a balancing of all these factors as well as a knowledge of the area and operation of the power system. No single element is determinative.

- Extreme fire danger threat levels, as classified by the National Fire Danger Rating System
- A RFW declaration by the National Weather Service
- Low humidity levels lower than what is required for a RFW
- Sustained winds exceeding design standards
- Site-specific conditions such as temperature, terrain, and local climate
- Critically dry vegetation that could serve as fuel for a wildfire
- On-the-ground, real-time observation from SMUD or other agency field staff

The PSO utilizes various operational and situational awareness tools to determine when de-energization is appropriate. The tools are listed below:

### 6.6 Enhancement and mitigation projects
SMUD forecasts and plans for upcoming work several years in advance. This planning process allows adequate level of staffing and funding for needed projects. This section identifies the specific upcoming projects that help reduce SMUD’s wildfire risk.

#### 6.6.2 Replace #6 Copper conductors in PCA
**Status:** Completed 2023  
**Start Date:** 2021  
**Expected Completion:** 2023  
This project targets SMUD’s PCA for removal of #6 copper conductors and replacement with heavier gauge aluminum. The project was proposed in conjunction with Eagle Take Permit mitigation work to reduce avian contacts issued in connection with the expansion of SMUD’s Wind Farm in Solano County. The mitigation activity involves re-framing approximately 185 poles to increase overhead conductor spacing.

#### 6.6.4 UARP Fuels Reduction
**Status:** Completed 2023  
**Start Date:** 2019  
**Expected Completion:** 2023  
This project is designed to help protect the UARP transmission lines and strengthen the fire break value it provides. The project area includes the entire length of SMUD’s UARP transmission line within the existing right-of-way corridor plus approximately 200 feet on each side. Project treatments are designed to increase the area of forest lands treated for fuels reduction and prescribed fire and contribute to the longer-term restoration of the Crystal Basin forested landscape. Implementation measures will reduce the density of surface and ladder fuels by mechanical thinning, masticating, and hand crew work as part of a larger suite of silvicultural prescriptions that restore mixed conifer composition, health, and vigor. The project seeks to establish conditions that allow for a mosaic of multiple age class forest stands, variation in tree size, density, and species composition through treatments that retain the largest trees while establishing conditions that allow for safe and efficient fire suppression, especially around private inholdings of Sierra foothill communities.

![SMUD Document](https://www.smud.org/wildfiresafety)

6.6.5  Install SCADA reclosers in PCA

**Status:** Deferred 2025 to 2027 due to unforeseen design and supply chain constraints  
**Start Date:** 2025  
**Expected Completion:** 2027  

The existing 12kV feeders serving PCA customers are non-SCADA. This project will install SCADA enabled reclosers on feeders that serve SMUD’s PCA customers. The SCADA reclosers will provide distribution operators visibility to the circuits and ability to operate the recloser remotely, including remotely disabling the reclosing function. The SCADA enabled reclosers will have modern microprocessor-based controllers, which will provide SMUD engineers the flexibility of fast-trip settings during fire season, and normal settings for improved reliability during storm season. Visibility to circuit’s measured values will provide distribution operators the ability to remotely de-energize the circuit(s) when conditions warrant or when requested by emergency response personnel.

7.2  Public and agency communications for a potential wildfire

Public safety is a guiding principle at SMUD. While SMUD's WMP activities are designed to mitigate wildfire danger, in instances of high fire threat conditions, interruption of electrical service by de-energizing powerlines may be necessary as a last resort. De-energizing powerlines may be the safest approach and makes sense if the risk of a wildfire starting and spreading is severe. SMUD proactively communicates with customers and key stakeholders through multiple channels about preparing for potential power outages, and the power restoration process. SMUD recognizes that many entities and individuals are particularly vulnerable during extended power outages and makes every effort to provide up-to-date information to these populations prior to, during and after an event.

This proactive communication is utilized for:

1) A wildfire threat to localized circuits within the SMUD service territory that results in localized de-energization.  
2) A wildfire threat to SMUD’s UARP hydroelectric generation and transmission system that results in a de-energization event causing a capacity/energy shortage (rotating outages).  
3) A wildfire threat to a major shared transmission line(s) that impacts the statewide grid or parts of it and creates a resource shortage for the utilities, including SMUD, that rely on the resources the line(s) provides.  

SMUD has implemented an opt-in program on smud.org that allows for vulnerable populations to receive additional information or notifications in the unlikely event of a wildfire in SMUD service territory.

Among SMUD’s most vulnerable customers are those enrolled in the Medical Equipment Discount Rate program (MED rate). These customers rely on specialized medical equipment that may require power. SMUD also has a Vulnerable Customer program which allows customers to self-identify as vulnerable for concerns not covered by our MED Rate, we include our Energy Assistance Program Rate (EAPR) and 3rd Party/Senior Id customers in this group. SMUD has more than 13,000 customers who rely on specialized medical equipment and who are enrolled in the MED rate program, 3rd Party/Senior ID program or enrolled in our Vulnerable Customer program. Additionally, SMUD has nearly 90,000 customers that participate in our EAPR program. SMUD will send these customers an email or letter each year to remind them of the risk of wildfire danger, to have an emergency back-up plan if an outage occurs, to update their contact information and refer them to smud.org/wildfiresafety for more information.

SMUD also proactively communicates before potential emergency events about our efforts to prepare for and reduce wildfire risk.

In advance of peak wildfire season, SMUD conducts ongoing communications about how to prepare for emergencies in the event of a wildfire, natural disaster or major outage. The communications include:

- Letters and emails to MED Rate, EAPR 3rd Party/Senior ID and self-identified vulnerable customers, with preparation checklists.
- Outdoor billboards
- Digital monitors in our customer lobby
- Bill inserts
- Reminders on SMUD.org homepage encouraging customers to update contact information
- Customer newsletters (print and email) on safety tips, preparation.

SMUD’s public information specialists will provide ongoing updates on multiple platforms, including social media, to provide customers and the community with up-to-date information about an emergency or potential emergency.

SMUD’s government affairs representatives will reach out to the executive staff of local governments, elected officials, SMUD’s state delegation, federal and tribe representatives and appropriate agency staff to provide initial contact and ongoing communications by email and phone with messages for their constituents.

In the time leading up to a potential or imminent de-energization event or emergency, SMUD makes every effort to maintain contact with customers it believes may be impacted and keep the media, local agencies and the public aware of the number of customers affected, and SMUD’s activities and restoration efforts.

Key stakeholders and public safety partners, including potentially impacted federal, state and local elected officials, City and County executive staff, tribe representatives and first responders are also contacted via a variety of channels. SMUD has specific personnel assigned to elected officials and agencies, and to critical customers including water and telecommunications utilities potentially affected by de-energized powerlines.

# WMP 2023 – 2025 | 2024 Update | Final  
**6/1/2024**

## 9.1 Effectiveness of the WMP

In the initial WMP, SMUD staff identified metrics that met the criteria of PUC 8387. These identified metrics were general in nature. Since those initial metric criteria were identified, the wildfire planning process has continued to develop, and SMUD has received independent evaluation of its WMP. In response to the industry’s maturing understanding of wildfire metrics and recommendations received, SMUD undertook a multi-step effort to identify new metrics that can better gauge the success of its many programs and mitigation activities outlined in the WMP.

The first step in this multi-step effort was to assess, identify and establish useful metrics that best measure the activities related to minimizing the probability that SMUD’s transmission and distribution system may be the origin or contributing source for the ignition of a wildfire. Metrics identified in this section are measures of quantitative assessment that will be used for assessing, comparing, and tracking performance of the programs and efforts identified in this WMP. This step was completed and reflected in the metrics identified in this WMP.

The second step is to define the benchmarks associated with the metrics. The purpose of these benchmarks is to establish criteria to measure performance of the various activities. Some activities can be measured with specific units of work that are forecasted at the beginning of a year, such as quantities of inspected units etc. Progress towards these forecasted units would indicate on- or off-track completion cadence, which can be adjusted as needed during the year. Other metrics are identified to count uncontrollable units that indicate performance of the grid, such as outage event counts or number of corrective action findings. Development of these benchmarks will require several years of data to determine trendlines and averages. Data collection for the new metrics began in 2021. Following existing practices, SMUD anticipates five years of data will be required to establish the benchmarks, with a target period in 2026.

The third and final step is to determine or define the percentage reduction targets against the benchmarks. Percent reductions against benchmarks would need to be realistic, and not easily achievable. SMUD anticipates the initial benchmarks would require fine adjustments periodically to ensure continued effort towards risk reduction activities. These benchmarks and adjustments will be reflected in SMUD’s annual WMP updates.

### 9.1.1 Metrics and assumptions for measuring WMP performance

SMUD will track the following metrics to measure the performance of this WMP, and its effectiveness in reducing catastrophic wildfire. These new set of metrics are more granular and targeted towards specific maintenance activities that can more closely be tied to performance of the WMP.

Work is identified in annual work plans authorized on an executive level, and work that remains incomplete will be flagged in future work plans. Work may be field-verified and open work notifications are regularly reviewed to allow management to prioritize work in accordance with current risks. SMUD’s target is always to complete 100 percent of the work within the initially scheduled time frame. However, emergencies or other unforeseen contingencies can occur that require material and labor resources to be otherwise assigned. In this instance delayed work will be prioritized in following time periods. All work is completed within time periods to allow for the safe and reliable operation of the electric system in accordance with applicable requirements and industry standards.

The Inspection Program Performance metrics shown in Table 88 are based on inspection activities for targeted areas. These are key performance indicators (KPI) based metrics, with specific targets for completion within a year.

## 9.1.2 Outcome Metrics

Two sets of outcome metrics were identified that measure performance of the grid. These metrics replace the more general “ignition events” identified in previous WMPs, which couldn’t directly be tied to risk categories. The outcome metrics shown in Table 9 are consistent with GO95 Rule 181¹ repair priority levels.

### Table 9 Grid Condition Findings

| Grid Condition Findings (Non KPI) |
|------------------------------------|
| Number of GO95 Rule 18 Level 1 findings, Distribution, PCA |
| Number of GO95 Rule 18 Level 1 findings, Distribution, HFTD Tier 2 |
| Number of GO95 Rule 18 Level 1 findings, Distribution, HFTD Tier 3 |

AAPI Heritage Month gives us an opportunity to learn about and honor the unique cultures, history and achievements of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in our community.

1. **Employee Resource Groups**  
   Thank you to our Groups Reaching Across International Networks, or GRAIN, and Military Employee Resource Groups for the work you do to provide inclusive representation for our employees through offering support, networking opportunities and a sense of community within SMUD. Each group hosted a special event for our employees in recognition of these observances. We have also been out in the community with our partners celebrating these important observances.

2. **Solano 4 Wind Project**  
   As you all know, we cut the ribbon at Solano 4 this week, celebrating an important milestone in our journey to decarbonize our power supply by 2030. The project’s increased capacity now brings the overall total to 300 megawatts annually. I am grateful to the Board for your deep commitment to our goal of a clean energy future. Thank you to those of you who were there on Monday to celebrate with us. We are getting there, and I am excited about our next effort – our Solano 5 wind repower project, which is planned to be online in 2029!

3. **Learning@SMUD**  
   Right now, we are in the middle of our three-week annual Learning@SMUD program! By offering employees dozens of learning sessions, with a combination of in-person and hybrid events, they are able to learn from peers, subject-matter experts and special guest speakers. This in-house professional development effort demonstrates our commitment to foster a culture of growth and excellence by empowering employees with comprehensive learning opportunities. Thank you and great work by all who made this year’s lineup possible!

4. **Annual Solar Regatta and Solar Car Race**  
   On the theme of learning, we held two big events for students this month. SMUD’s 11th Annual Solar Regatta was a great success! High

school and college students raced their handcrafted boats across Rancho Seco Lake over two days. Local students also gathered at Sac State and Cosumnes River College to participate in SMUD’s 17th Annual Solar Car Race. And this year for the first time, middle school students joined the high schoolers in the fun, competing and racing their own solar powered cars. Thanks to the SMUD Board members who attended these events, and to our team of employees for creating engaging events for our next generation of clean energy leaders.

5) **Awards.** As for awards, team SMUD continues to shine! First off, our own Jose Bodipo-Memba, Chief Diversity Officer, was recognized with a 2024 C-Suite Award by the *Sacramento Business Journal*! Jose’s professional accomplishments reflect his commitment to the betterment of our workforce and of our entire region. His positive vision has fostered an inclusive company culture by ensuring all voices are included and heard. Congratulations, Jose! We were also thrilled to be recognized by the Smart Electric Power Alliance with their Equity Power Player of the Year Award for our Community Impact Plan. This is especially gratifying as it acknowledges how, through the Plan, we are addressing energy inequities and ensuring all communities benefit from a clean energy future. Lastly, the California Department of General Services awarded SMUD the Reciprocity Partner of the Year, specifically for our Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) program. Truthfully, I am humbled every day by what we are accomplishing together. Congratulations to all.

6) **Board Video.** Tonight’s video gives an inside look at the great work our employees are doing at SMUD’s substations and how they help us maintain our world class reliability.

So unfair to force customers who use make a conscious effort toward utilization of low amounts of energy to subsidize those who use larger amounts. This comment refers to the separately imposed infrastructure charge which SMUD chooses to assess equally upon all customers. Once again, my infrastructure charge, 24.15, is not proportionate to my March period energy usage charge of 27.40. I truly resent the fact that someone who chalks up multiple times my usage fees pays equal to myself, 24.15, for the cost of infrastructure.

If you look at my account 2500499, the fact may be verified that, for most months the infrastructure charge has been higher than fees charged for my energy usage. Subsidization for low-income users is not the answer, subsidization of high energy users by way of an evenly applied infrastructure charge is problematic.

Finally, although SMUD contact information is on your website, the link that one is directed to following bill payment is not reliably functional. My offered comments consistently bounce back as undeliverable, possibly because I am blocked within your system for my frequent attempts to address this issue. An honorable community entity such as SMUD would claim to be, should identify accurate communication links on the monthly printed bill.

**SMUD BOARD POLICY**  
**Category:** Board-Staff Linkage  
**Policy No.:** BL-8  
**Title:** Delegation to the CEO with Respect to Procurement  

The procurement of goods and services is an integral part of SMUD operations. SMUD’s procurement activities shall take place in accordance with the following principles:

a) **Competition:** SMUD’s procurement activities shall be competitive whenever practical.

b) **Direct Procurement:** Direct procurement may be utilized when it is in SMUD’s best interest. Direct procurement is the purchase of goods or services without competition when multiple sources of supply are available.

c) **Sole Source Procurement:** Sole source procurement shall be performed only in the case of emergency or when a competitive process would be an idle act.

d) **Inclusiveness:** SMUD’s procurement practices shall promote inclusiveness of the entire supplier-contractor community in its contracting opportunities.

e) **Economic Development:** SMUD’s procurement practices shall promote the economic development of the community we serve.

f) **Environmental Procurement:** SMUD shall minimize the impact on the environment through its procurement practices. In making procurement decisions, staff shall consider the environmental impacts in assessing total cost and benefits.

g) **Responsible Bidder:** SMUD shall only do business with reputable and responsible suppliers-contractors. A Responsible Bidder demonstrates trustworthiness, quality, capacity, financial capability, fair labor practices, and experience to satisfactorily perform SMUD work through the bidding and evaluation process. In addition, SMUD will determine Responsible Bidders by considering a supplier's contractor’s social, environmental ethical, and safety accountability where applicable.

h) **Supplier Contractor Code of Conduct:** SMUD shall set minimum expectations or standards for all suppliers-contractors to follow in the course of doing business with SMUD (in some cases by submitting data and reporting annually) including but not limited to, labor and human rights, environmental, social, governance (ESG), health and safety accountability, ethics and compliance, and diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging practices.

i) **Best Value Procurement:** SMUD may procure goods and services by the best value at the lowest cost methodology, where cost and other factors are used to obtain the maximum value while ensuring a fair and equitable process.

j) **Leveraged Procurement Agreement (LPA)**: SMUD may procure goods and services where another lead public agency or organization competitively procures the same goods or services under applicable state and federal laws to streamline procurement processes and leverage collective buying power of multiple agencies to achieve cost savings and other benefits to SMUD. Leveraged procurement agreements are generally referred to by other public agencies as “Cooperative Purchasing Agreements.”

k) **Strategic Alliances**: SMUD may enter into strategic alliance contracts for the procurement of goods or services. A Strategic Alliance is a competitively bid multi-year contract for goods and/or services in which the SupplierContractor and SMUD work collaboratively over the life of the contract to improve quality, and to explore design and process improvements to reduce the cost of production, service delivery, and the total cost of ownership. These benefits are shared both by SMUD and the SupplierContractor.

l) **Supply Chain Risk**: SMUD’s procurement activities shall identify, manage, and mitigate supply chain risks through a coordinated effort across the enterprise.

m) **Protest Policy**: SMUD shall ensure that suppliers-contractors are afforded the opportunity to have their grievances heard through a fair protest process.

n) **Delegation of Authority to the CEO**: The Chief Executive Officer and General Manager (CEO) is delegated authority to perform and approve the procurement activities in accordance with the below matrix. This delegation includes the authority to amend contracts for time extensions or other changes that create no additional cost to SMUD.

**SUBJECT:** Audit Report No. 28007745  
Board Monitoring Report; SD-4: Reliability  

Internal Audit Services (IAS) received the SD-4 Reliability 2023 Annual Board Monitoring Report and performed the following:  

- Selected a sample of statements and assertions in the report for review.  
- Interviewed report contributors and verified the methodology used to prepare the statements in our sample.  
- Validated the reasonableness of the statements in our sample based on the data or other support provided to us.  

During the review, nothing came to IAS’ attention that would suggest the items sampled within the SD Board Monitoring report did not fairly represent the source data available at the time of the review.

# Board Monitoring Report 2023
## SD-4 Reliability

1) **Background**

Strategic Direction SD-4 Reliability states that:

Meeting customer energy requirements is a core value of SMUD.

Therefore:

a) SMUD will assure all customer energy requirements are met. This will be accomplished through the use of: (i) its generation resources and purchase power portfolio 100 percent of the time; and (ii) its transmission assets to assure an overall availability of at least 99.99 percent.

b) SMUD will achieve distribution system reliability by:

- Limiting the average frequency of outage per customer per year to:
  - With major event: 0.99 – 1.33
  - Excluding major event: 0.85 – 1.14

- Limiting the average duration of outages per customer per year to:
  - With major event: 67.5 – 93.3 minutes
  - Excluding major event: 49.7 – 68.7 minutes

Ensuring that no individual circuits exceed these targets for more than two consecutive years. For circuits that exceed these targets for two consecutive years, a remedial action plan will be issued and completed within eighteen months.

c) SMUD will maintain the electric system in good repair and make the necessary upgrades to maintain load serving capability and meet regulatory standards.

2) **Executive summary**

Improving reliability is essential to meeting customer energy requirements and drives customer loyalty.

SMUD was in compliance for both generation and transmission availability. SMUD met all energy supply requirements 100% of the time through its generation resources and purchased power. At a peak load of 3,092 megawatts (MW) (which occurred on

August 16, 53% of the generation was provided by internal resources and 47% was provided by purchased power. The transmission availability was at 100% for the year.

**SMUD was in compliance for System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) (excluding major events).** Reliability targets were exceeded for System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) excluding major events (75.6 minutes), as well as SAIFI (1.42) and SAIDI (318.2 minutes) including major events. The 2023 distribution system reliability performance is summarized in Table 1 below.

**Table 1: 2023 Distribution System Reliability Performance**

| Including Major Events | Excluding Major Events |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| SD-4 Limit             | 2023 Results           | SD-4 Limit             | 2023 Results           |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| SAIFI                  | 1.33                   | 1.42                   | 1.14                   | 1.01                   |
| SAIDI (minutes)       | 93.3                   | 318.2                  | 68.7                   | 75.6                   |

Major events are defined as events caused by earthquake, fire, or storms of sufficient intensity which result in a state of emergency being declared by the government. Absent the declaration of a state of emergency, any other natural disaster may be excluded only if it affects more than 15% of the system facilities or 10% of the customers, whichever is less.

There are 763 distribution circuits of which 98.7%, or 753 circuits, met the SD-4 reliability criteria. Twenty projects (primarily cable replacement) were issued to improve reliability, of which eleven have been completed. The remaining nine projects are on schedule to be completed within the eighteen-month requirement. These projects include cable replacement, avian mitigation, tripsaver installations and other work.

**3) Additional supporting information**

**Generation**

**Hydro Generation Facilities**

The availability rate for SMUD’s hydro generation system in 2023 was 86.41% and for the June 1st through September 30th period, hydro generation availability was 88.11%. SMUD’s Upper American River Project (UARP) hydro system generated 2,375 gigawatt hours (GWh). The budgeted generation was 1,635 GWh.

The lower hydro availability rate was due to an unscheduled outage at Camino resulting from a transformer failure (T1). This outage began in June and extended through the end of the year. The failed transformer was replaced in March 2024.

SMUD has approximately 488 miles of transmission lines and 10,882 miles of distribution lines including 69 kilovolt (kV). Approximately 40% of the distribution lines are installed overhead and 60% are installed underground. The transmission system is predominately overhead except for 19 miles of underground lines located in the Carmichael and downtown areas.

Staff monitors circuit reliability regularly to assess circuits that could potentially exceed the reliability limits. Outage causes, trends, and reliability impacts are analyzed to identify corrective actions that will bring the reliability of these circuits within the acceptable range.

Challenges  
On the evening of December 31, 2022, the first of nine atmospheric river storms hit northern California. The impact of these storms started in 2022 and carried over into 2023 causing significant damage to the grid, affecting approximately 264,000 customers, a SAIDI contribution of 242.6 minutes, and a SAIFI contribution of 0.41 in 2023. The unexpected storms brought over 60 miles per hour (mph) wind gusts, with 48 mph sustained winds, coupled with almost two inches of rain. With the ground saturated by heavy rains combined with high winds, over 1000 trees over several days were uprooted all over the Sacramento region with many trees falling onto SMUD’s overhead lines. These types of tree related outages take longer to resolve since the trees must be removed from the tangled powerlines prior to the start of rebuilding the lines.

# Drivers for Reliability Performance

The main drivers for the distribution system performance excluding major events, along with the mitigation measures for each, are summarized below.

## Non-Preventable Tree Outages

The leading cause of outages in 2023 was non-preventable tree outages. Overall, there was a 143% increase in the number of non-preventable tree outages, with a 609% increase in SAIDI minutes and a 285% increase in SAIFI, when comparing with 2022. This dramatic increase in non-preventable tree outages was caused by the numerous storm days in the first quarter of 2023 that did not qualify as major event days.

To further improve on the impact of non-preventable tree outages on the grid, SMUD’s vegetation management department continues to be proactive in our maintenance activities. This will improve the reduction of non-preventable tree outages.

## Equipment Failures

Equipment failures are associated with a wide variety of distribution line components, such as fuses, poles, wire hardware, broken connectors, broken jumpers, failed transformers, broken cutouts and more. Outages due to failed equipment continue to be evaluated to locate and address any systemic deficiencies.

Failed equipment was the second leading cause of outages in 2023. When compared to 2022, outages due to equipment failures increased by 17%, SAIDI minutes increased by 37% and SAIFI decreased by 12%. This decrease in SAIFI was caused by a reduction in the number of customers experiencing equipment related outages from 107,206 customers in 2022 to 95,915 customers in 2023.

Multiple inspection and maintenance programs are in place to identify and correct deficiencies before they result in failure. We have annual line patrols to detect obvious deficiencies. In addition, we perform detailed line inspections (DLI) every five years. During a DLI, the inspector examines every attachment on the pole and documents deficiencies found. The deficiencies are prioritized and repaired based upon predetermined schedules.

## Underground Cable Failures

In 2023, underground cable failures were the third leading driver to quantity of outage events. The number of outages due to cable failures decreased by 12% compared to 2022. Additionally, SAIDI and SAIFI values decreased by 1% and 7% respectively. Improved performance in this area is primarily driven by targeted selection of cables.

<!-- Page 96 -->
Furthermore, there has been a 15% reduction in number of single-phase circuit failures in 2023 compared to 2022, which has led to the reduction of overall cable outages. Additionally, cable injection work in 2024, will target 69kV circuits, which impact a large number of customers. Injection is expected to improve reliability of those lines for up to 25 additional years.

## Appendix 3: Reliability Comparison

Table 3 below provides a comparison between SMUD’s average distribution system performance compared to that of Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&E’s) distribution system. PG&E defines its distribution system as operating voltages less than 60kV and uses the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 1366 standards to define major event days, while SMUD includes the 69kV operating voltage as part of the distribution system and uses an alternate method to determine major event days. The information regarding PG&E’s system average performance was obtained from the 2022 reliability report posted on the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) website. PG&E’s 2023 Reliability Report is not posted on the CPUC website yet.

### Table 3: Distribution System Reliability Comparison (excluding major events)

| Year | SAIDI (minutes) | SAIFI |
|------|------------------|-------|
|      | SMUD | PG&E | SMUD | PG&E |
| 2019 | 66.0 | 103.1 | 1.04 | 0.88 |
| 2020 | 47.6 | 111.2 | 0.90 | 0.93 |
| 2021 | 60.4 | 160 | 1.04 | 1.03 |
| 2022 | 53.7 | 184.5 | 0.93 | 1.28 |
| 2023 | 75.6 | N/A | 1.01 | N/A |

**Notes:**
1. Listed SAIFI and SAIDI numbers are based on outages greater than 5 minutes (CPUC criteria).

# ENERGY RISK MANAGEMENT AND ENERGY TRADING STANDARDS  
## SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT  

### PURPOSE  
The wholesale energy markets are exposed to numerous risks including, but not limited to, market price risk, supply risk, credit risk and regulatory risk. The purpose of the Energy Risk Management and Energy Trading Standards (the “Standards”) is to establish protocols for prudent risk mitigation and management.  

### SCOPE  
The Standards apply to:  
- The operation of SMUD-owned or controlled generation, transmission, natural gas and other fuel reserves and pipeline assets;  
- Contracts for and related to the purchase and sale of wholesale electricity, electric capacity and storage, natural gas and clean and emissions-free fuel, and environmental products;  
- Contracts for and related to transmission, natural gas and clean or emissions-free fuel transportation, and storage; and  
- Contracts for and related to financially hedging or mitigating risks associated with wholesale electricity, electric capacity and natural gas and other fuel prices, supplies and markets.  

### PRIORITIES  
The Chief Executive Officer/General Manager (CEO/GM) implement the Standards in accordance with Board policies and with the following priorities, listed in order of importance:  

**Priority 1.** Manage resource mix to comply with Board Strategic Direction (SD-4) Reliability.  

**Priority 2.** Minimize net commodity energy purchase costs while operating within the targets established in Board Strategic Direction (SD-3) Access to Credit Markets.  

**Priority 3.** Optimize SMUD-owned or controlled assets, including but not limited to, generation, transmission, fuel reserves, pipeline assets, fuel storage and contract resources to create additional value for SMUD and its customers, while complying with Board policies and all applicable laws and regulations.

**NARRATIVE:**  
**Requested Action:**  
Approve Contract Change No. 1 to Contract No. 4600001773 with Kortick Manufacturing, LLC, for supply of network transformers, to extend the contract expiration date from November 14, 2024, to February 28, 2026, and increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by $10 million, from $11 million to $21 million.

**Summary:**  
Contract No. 4600001270 was awarded on a competitive basis to Frase Enterprises, Inc. in May 2019 for supply of network transformer to support SMUD’s ongoing maintenance requirements. The original contract was awarded for the period from May 15, 2019 to May 14, 2023, for a not-to-exceed amount of $1 million. Contract Change No. 1 increased the contract not to exceed amount from $1 million to $3.5 million and added one new transformer stock code to the contract. Contract Change No. 2 increased the contract amount from $3.5 million to $8 million and extended the contract expiration date from May 14, 2023 to May 14, 2024. Contract Change No. 3 increased the contract not-to-exceed amount from $8 million to $11 million and extended the contract expiration date from May 14, 2024 to November 14, 2024. Contract Change No. 4 assigned Contract No. 4600001270 with Frase Enterprises, Inc. to Kortick Manufacturing LLC. Contract No. 4600001773 was replaced with Contract No. 4600001773. This Contract Change No. 1 to Contract No. 4600001773 requests approval to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by $10 million, from $11 million to $21 million and extend the contract expiration date from November 14, 2024, to February 28, 2026. The original contract was intended to support SMUD’s ongoing maintenance requirements. SMUD’s Energy Delivery & Operations team identified a significant increase in our upcoming demand for network transformers with plans to replace approximately 50 network transformers each year through 2028. Due to equipment lead times, SMUD needs to order the network transformers now to maintain the transformer replacement schedule for 2025. SMUD is currently sourcing replacement contract(s) for network transformers with expectations to award later this year. The new contracts will not be awarded in time to place orders for work scheduled to take place in 2025 but will support the needed transformers for years 2026 through 2028.

Currently, the contract balance is approximately $168,000.

40
<!-- Page 204 -->
# SMUD Power Purchase Agreement

## 4.9.1 Compliance Expenditure Cap
The Parties agree that expenditures to comply with the requirements of Sections 4.1 through 4.8 and Sections 5.1 through 5.3 are “Compliance Expenditures” and that the Compliance Expenditures that Seller shall be required to bear during the Term of this Agreement shall be capped at a total of one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars ($125,000) per Contract Year and one million two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($1,250,000) in the aggregate over the Term (“Compliance Expenditure Cap”).

## 4.9.2 Change in Law
If a change in Law occurs after the Effective Date that affects Seller’s compliance with its obligations under any of Sections 4.1 through 4.8 and Sections 5.1 through 5.3, Seller shall not be in breach of such obligations if Seller has used commercially reasonable efforts to comply with such change in Law as it pertains to such obligations. For purposes of this Section 4.9, the term “commercially reasonable efforts” shall not require additional out-of-pocket expenditures in the aggregate in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap in complying with the changes in Law described in this Section 4.9 unless Buyer and Seller have agreed in writing for Buyer to reimburse Seller for or to pay directly such excess expenditures.

## 4.9.3 Excess Compliance Expenditures
### 4.9.3.1
Within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter during the Term, Seller shall provide Buyer with a report describing the Compliance Expenditures that Seller incurred during that calendar quarter and the total Compliance Expenditures incurred during the Contract Year that includes such calendar quarter. Prior to incurring Compliance Expenditures that are anticipated to exceed the Compliance Expenditure Cap in any Contract Year or over the Term, Seller shall notify Buyer of the expected Compliance Expenditures. Following such notice, the Parties shall attempt to agree to limit such Compliance Expenditures to the extent practicable; provided, however, that nothing herein limits Seller’s right to incur Compliance Expenditures that Seller believes in good faith must be incurred for Seller to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, as long as the above notification provisions are met.

### 4.9.3.2
If Seller determines that Compliance Expenditures in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap will have to be incurred, then Seller shall notify Buyer and provide documentation and calculations to support the expected expenditures.

41
<!-- Page 205 -->
# SMUD Power Purchase Agreement

excess Compliance Expenditures. Buyer may then: (1) approve the expected excess Compliance Expenditures and notify Seller of such approval, and Seller shall comply upon receipt of notice of Buyer’s approval and Buyer’s payment to Seller for the expected excess Compliance Expenditures; or (2) elect not to pay Seller for the expected excess Compliance Expenditures and notify Seller of such decision, in which case this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and Seller shall continue to be excused from performing or meeting any obligation that causes, or would cause, the incurrence of such Compliance Expenditures in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap, and Buyer shall pay Seller the Contract Price in full notwithstanding any such non-performance or non-compliance. Buyer is not required to reimburse Seller for any Compliance Expenditures unless and until Buyer agrees to the expected Compliance Expenditures in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap and, if Buyer elects not to reimburse Seller for any such Compliance Expenditures, then Seller shall be excused from performing or meeting any obligation in this Agreement that requires Seller’s payment or incurrence of such unreimbursed Compliance Expenditures in excess of the Compliance Expenditure Cap. For avoidance of doubt, if a Change in Law makes it infeasible for Seller to comply with its obligations under this Section 4.9, and it is not possible to overcome the Change in Law through the expenditure of money, then (i) Seller shall be excused from the corresponding Compliance Actions under this Agreement, and (ii) Buyer shall continue to pay Seller under this Agreement without any reduction in revenues that otherwise would result from the Change in Law.

## 5. CONVEYANCE OF CAPACITY ATTRIBUTES

<!-- Page 214 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

otherwise agreed to in writing. Seller, in its role as the Party responsible for acting as or obtaining a Scheduling Coordinator, expects to receive notification from CAISO approximately thirty (30) days after COD that the Participating Intermittent Resource has been certified. If CAISO notification has not been received by forty (40) days after COD, Seller will take all necessary steps to ensure that CAISO certifies the project as a Participating Intermittent Resource. From the time the Project begins producing Test Energy until such time that the resource VER forecast is visible in the VER Forecasting Program, Seller shall provide a fifteen (15)-minute forecast of the Project’s Energy output to Buyer. In the event that the VER Forecasting Program or the CAISO Tariff and/or any protocols relating thereto are changed, amended, modified replaced or terminated, and Seller’s costs to comply increase, Seller and Buyer agree to comply with such revisions and, to the extent practical, to implement such revisions in a manner that maintains the relative economic positions of the parties as of the date of this Agreement. Seller shall perform according to the Scheduling Procedures, attached as Exhibit J to the Agreement, which may be amended by the Parties’ agreement from time to time.

9.3 Planned Outages  
For the purposes of this Agreement a maintenance outage shall constitute a Planned Outage; provided that this Section 9.3 does not modify or restrict Seller’s rights under Section 7.2. Planned Outages may only be taken upon thirty (30) calendar days’ written notice to Buyer; provided, however, if there are short maintenance outages that can be completed between 10:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. or on Saturday or Sunday in accordance with Prudent Industry Practice, such outages may be conducted upon three (3) calendar days written notice to Buyer. Seller shall avoid Planned Outages during the months of May through September, to the extent practicable. Seller shall provide Planned Outage and short maintenance outage notifications in accordance with the Outage Notification Procedure detailed in Exhibit G.

9.4 Forced Outages  
Seller shall notify Buyer of any Forced Outage of the Project that reduces the Project Capacity by more than five percent (5%) for more than twenty-four (24) hours’ duration or that is expected to reduce the available Capacity by more than five percent (5%) during any WECC defined on-peak period during the months of May through
<!-- Page 215 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

September. Seller shall provide Forced Outage notifications as described above in accordance with the Outage Notification Procedure detailed in Exhibit G.

**9.5 Modification of Outage Notification Procedure**  
The Parties may modify Exhibit G to reflect mutually agreed-upon changes necessary in the Outage Notification Procedure, and issue a new Exhibit G reflecting such mutually agreed upon changes which shall then become part of the Agreement.

**9.6 Access Rights**  
Buyer, its authorized agents, employees and inspectors, shall have the right to inspect the Project on reasonable advance notice during normal business hours and for any purposes reasonably connected with this Agreement or the exercise of any and all rights secured to Buyer by law. During any on-site inspections, Buyer shall comply, and shall cause its representatives to comply, with Seller’s or the Project operator’s safety and security requirements and protocols. Seller shall keep Buyer informed of current procedures for communicating with Seller’s or the Project operator’s safety and security departments or personnel. Buyer shall be responsible for having provided commercially reasonable insurance for any such Buyer-related personnel, and shall not interfere with work on or operation of the Facility.

**9.7 Control Facilities**  
Seller shall ensure accurate operation of all necessary facilities, including metering, communications, telemetry and meteorological equipment as required under the CAISO Tariff. Seller shall test such facilities, and implement such protocols and practices, and thereafter maintain such facilities, as necessary (a) for Seller or the Project operator to respond and follow instructions, including an electronic signal conveying real time instructions, to operate the Project as directed by the Buyer in accordance with this Agreement and the CAISO Tariff and/or the CAISO, and (b) for Buyer and/or the CAISO to control the quantity of Energy generated by the Project in order to respond to curtailments.

With respect to Seller, the occurrence of any of the following also shall be an Event of Default:

10.1.2.1 The Project fails to achieve Commercial Operation of at least ninety five percent (95%) of the Contract Capacity on or prior to the Guaranteed Commercial Operation Date, as that date may be extended by Seller through an extension of the Scheduled COD in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section 2.3.6;

<!-- Page 218 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

period is not due to Seller’s action or inaction, in which case (i) Seller shall have a day-for-day delay right to obtain RPS Certification up to an additional six (6) months for a total of no more than twelve (12) months after COD as long as such day-for-day delay is not due to Seller’s action or inaction, and (ii) Seller shall present to Buyer a reasonable plan of action laying out those steps that Seller shall take in order to obtain such RPS Certification as quickly as possible;

10.1.2.4 If, in any two consecutive Contract Years, the Adjusted AEP in each such Contract Year is less than eighty-five percent (85%) of the Adjusted MAEP for such Contract Year, which Adjusted MAEP shall include an annual degradation rate of one half of one percent (MAEP*.005) beginning on the first day of the second full Contract Year of this Agreement, and annually thereafter (as set forth in Exhibit C); and as adjusted for the Actual Annual Solar Insolation, subject to the following provisions:

(a) Any Notice of termination for an Event of Default under this Section 10.1.2.4 shall be given in writing a minimum of sixty (60) calendar days prior to the effectiveness of such termination and within one hundred twenty (120) calendar days following the end of the second of the applicable two Contract Years that triggered such Event of Default; provided, however, that Buyer’s ability to exercise such termination right in respect of any two consecutive Contract Years shall be deferred for up to one year (or deferred up to two years if caused by a Transformer Failure or Serial Defect) if Seller has demonstrated to Buyer, and is actively implementing in good faith, a “Cure Plan” for any such failure as described below;

(b) A Cure Plan may include, but is not limited to, the addition of solar modules to the system at Seller’s sole expense;

(d) Buyer’s non-objection to, or requested modifications to, Seller’s Cure Plan does not waive Buyer’s termination rights in the event that the Cure Plan is not ultimately effective to cause the Adjusted MAEP for the two

55
<!-- Page 219 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

succeeding Contract Year period after the Contract Year in which the Cure Plan is implemented (or, if the Event of Default was caused by a Transformer Failure or Serial Defect, the two succeeding Contract Year period after the two Contract Year period in which the Cure Plan is implemented) to equal or exceed eighty-five percent (85%) of the applicable Adjusted MAEP (decreased as set forth in Section 10.1.2.4 above);

(e) Any disagreements regarding the Cure Plan will be resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions in Section 22 hereof; and

10.1.2.5 Subject to Section 4.9, Seller’s failure after the Commercial Operation Date to maintain RPS Certification for the Project, if such failure is not cured within thirty (30) Days after written notice from Buyer; provided that during any period where Seller has not maintained RPS Certification for the Project, whether before or after written notice, Buyer shall not be obligated to purchase any Energy or other Products from Seller hereunder, but Seller may sell such Energy and other Products to third parties; or

10.1.2.6 With respect to any Surety Bond provided for the benefit of Buyer, the failure by Seller to provide for the benefit of Buyer either (1) cash, (2) a replacement Surety Bond from a different Surety Bond Provider, or (3) a replacement Letter of Credit from an issuer meeting the criteria set forth in the definition of Qualified Issuer, in each case, in the amount required hereunder within ten (10) Business Days after Seller receives notice of the occurrence of any of the following events:

(a) if any representation or warranty made by the Surety Bond Provider in connection with this Agreement is false or misleading in any material respect when made or when deemed made or repeated, and such default is not remedied within thirty (30) days after notice thereof;

## 10.2 Declaration of an Event of Default

If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the other Party (“Non-Defaulting Party”) shall have the right to: (a) send notice, designating a day, no earlier than five calendar days after such notice is deemed to be received and no later than twenty (20) calendar days after such notice is deemed to be received, as an early termination date of this Agreement (“Early Termination Date”) unless the Parties have agreed to resolve the circumstances giving rise to the Event of Default; (b) accelerate all amounts owing between the Parties; and (c) terminate this Agreement and end the Delivery Term effective as of the Early Termination Date. For all claims, causes of action and damages with respect to an Event of Default, in addition to the right to terminate this Agreement, the Non-Defaulting Party shall be entitled to recover actual damages allowed by law unless otherwise limited by this Agreement. Neither the enumeration of Events of Default in Section 10.1, nor the termination of this Agreement by a Non-Defaulting Party, shall limit the right of a Non-Defaulting Party to rights and remedies available at law, including claims for breach of contract or failure to perform by the other Party and for direct damages incurred by the Non-Defaulting Party as a result of the termination of this Agreement, subject in each case to any limitations in this Agreement.

## 10.3 Termination Payment Calculation

If an Event of Default occurs, ultimately resulting in termination of the Agreement, a “Termination Payment” shall be determined in accordance with this Section 10.3.

The “Termination Payment” payable by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party shall equal: (i) Non-Defaulting Party’s Loss as calculated under paragraph (a) below and discounted to present value as set forth under paragraph (b) below; plus (ii) Non-Defaulting Party’s Cost as calculated under paragraph (c) below; which will then be

57
<!-- Page 221 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

aggregated with any amounts owed to the Non-Defaulting Party as of the Early Termination Date and any set-offs to which Defaulting Party is entitled as set forth under paragraph (d) below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the sum of the amounts calculated under paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) below would be less than zero (i.e., if the calculation of the Non-Defaulting Party’s Loss plus its Costs yields a negative number under the calculation below), then the result of that calculation shall be deemed to be zero.

(a) The Parties intend that Non-Defaulting Party’s “Loss” shall be the economic loss (exclusive of Costs), if any, resulting from the termination of the Agreement, determined in a commercially reasonable manner as calculated in accordance with this Section 10.3. The Loss, if any, suffered by Non-Defaulting Party shall be determined by comparing the value of the remaining term, applying the Expected Annual Energy Production (EAEP) and the Contract Price for each year of the remaining term under the Agreement had it not been terminated to the equivalent quantity and each party obtaining, in good faith and from non-affiliated market participants in the relevant market, two quotes for prices of CA RPS PCC 1 bundled renewable energy and RECs for the affected period of a similar quality and quantity in the geographical location closest in proximity to the Delivery Point and averaging the four quotes. If either Party fails to provide two quotes then the average of the other party’s two quotes shall determine the replacement price. For clarity, if Buyer is the Non-Defaulting Party, the Non-Defaulting Party’s Loss equals the amount by which the market price of replacement Energy and Environmental Attributes exceeds the Contract Price therefor, and if the Seller is the Non-Defaulting Party, the Non-Defaulting Party’s Loss equals (A) the amount by which the Contract Price hereunder exceeds the market price of such Energy and Environmental Attributes, plus (B) the value of lost Production Tax Credits that Seller would have earned on such Energy and Environmental Attributes for the relevant years of the remaining term applying the Expected Annual Energy Production (EAEP) for each year of the remaining term, under Internal Revenue Code (Title 26 of the U.S. Code, Section 45 and Section 45Y), less any expenses saved by Seller due to Buyer’s default, which includes, but is not limited to, any cost of production of the Energy and Environmental Attributes not incurred by Seller. To ascertain the market price of a replacement contract, Non-Defaulting Party may consider, among other valuations, quotations from leading dealers in ERR contracts, and other bona fide third party offers, all adjusted for the length of the remaining term and differences in transmission. It is expressly agreed that the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to enter into replacement transactions in order to determine the Termination Payment. 

58
<!-- Page 222 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

(b) The Loss calculated under paragraph (a) above shall be discounted to present value using the Present Value Rate as of the time of termination (to take into account the period between the time notice of termination was effective and when such amount would have otherwise been due pursuant to this Agreement).

(c) The Non-Defaulting Party’s “Costs” shall be calculated as the sum of the brokerage fees, commissions and other similar transaction costs and expenses reasonably incurred in terminating and replacing the Agreement, including reasonable transmission costs associated with any replacement contract, and reasonable attorneys’ fees, if any, incurred in connection with Non-Defaulting Party enforcing its rights with regard to the Agreement. Non-Defaulting shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate or eliminate Costs.

(d) The Non-Defaulting Party shall add any amounts owed by the Defaulting Party to the Non-Defaulting Party as of the Early Termination Date to, and shall set-off any amounts owing by the Non-Defaulting Party as of the Early Termination Date, against the Termination Payment so that all such amounts are aggregated and/or netted to a single amount. The net amount due shall be paid within thirty (30) Business Days following the effective date of termination, or, if the Parties disagree regarding the calculation of the Termination Payment pursuant to Section 10.4 below, the date that the Parties agree on the Termination Payment.

(e) In no event, however, shall the calculation of Loss or Costs include any penalties or similar charges imposed by the Non-Defaulting Party.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) Seller’s aggregate liability under this Agreement prior to the Commercial Operation Date, including arising out of a termination of this Agreement, shall not exceed an amount equal to the Damage Payment, and (ii) if an Event of Default by Seller has occurred prior to the Commercial Operation Date, and Buyer has not provided any reply regarding such Event of Default within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of such Event of Default by Seller, then, provided such Event of Default is then continuing, Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and pay the Damage Payment then owing hereunder to Buyer.

(g) Payment by the Defaulting Party of the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, shall constitute liquidated damages and the Non-Defaulting Party’s sole and exclusive remedy for the Event of Default and declaration of an Early Termination Date related thereto, and further provided, promptly upon Buyer’s receipt of the Damage Payment or Termination Payment, as applicable, Buyer shall return to Seller the Development Security or the Performance Security to the extent either of them, as applicable, did not comprise (i.e., was not used as) the Damage. 

59
<!-- Page 223 -->
# SMUD Power Purchase Agreement

Payment or the Termination Payment, as applicable, and neither Party shall have any further obligation or liability to the other Party hereunder.

## 10.4 Disputes

If the Defaulting Party reasonably disagrees with the calculation of the Termination Payment and the Parties cannot otherwise resolve their differences, the calculation issue shall be resolved in accordance with Section 22 of this Agreement.

## 11. CREDITWORTHINESS

Within ten (10) Business Days of execution of this Agreement by both Parties, Seller shall provide Buyer with one of the following: (a) cash (subject to an escrow agreement reasonably acceptable to each Party); (b) a letter of credit from a Qualified Issuer substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit K-1 (“Seller Letter of Credit”) in each case in the amount of forty-five dollars ($45) per kW of Contract Capacity (the “Project Development Security”), which shall be returned to Seller upon the COD. Seller shall have no obligation to replenish the Project Development Security after any draw thereon, no lien or other security shall be required, and Buyer’s recourse against Seller shall be limited to the Project Development Security provided.

Upon receipt of the Delivery Term Security, Buyer shall return to Seller the Project Development Security provided pursuant to Section 11.1. Seller shall maintain the applicable Delivery Term Security for the duration of the Term; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement, Seller’s replenishment obligation with respect to the Delivery Term Security shall be limited such that the total amount of any replenishments of the Delivery Term Security shall not exceed one (1) time the amount of the original Delivery Term Security. If Seller provides a Letter of
<!-- Page 224 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

Credit, Seller shall renew or provide a new Letter of Credit or cash or a Surety Bond at least thirty (30) calendar days before the current Letter of Credit expiration date.

No lien or other security shall be required and Buyer’s recourse against Seller shall be limited to the Delivery Term Security provided.

“Qualified Issuer” means a major U.S. commercial bank or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank that, at the time of delivery of a Letter of Credit, (i) has assets of at least ten billion dollars ($10,000,000,000), (ii) has a senior unsecured long-term credit rating of A- or better by Standard and Poor’s and A3 or better by Moody’s, and (iii) is reasonably acceptable to SMUD; provided, however, that (A) Buyer shall confirm or deny such acceptance within five (5) Business Days after receipt of Seller’s notice regarding its proposed Qualified Issuer and if no response is received by Seller within such five (5) Business Day period, then Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted such Qualified Issuer, (B) notwithstanding anything to the contrary here, Seller shall have ten (10) Business Days from receipt of Buyer’s acceptance or deemed acceptance of a Qualified Issuer to post the Seller Letter of Credit, (C) if Buyer denies acceptance of a proposed Qualified Issuer, then the timelines for Seller to provide a Seller Letter of Credit shall restart for all purposes hereunder, and (D) Buyer may not deny acceptance of a proposed Qualified Issuer more than two (2) times.

11.3 First Priority Security Interest in Cash or Cash Equivalent Collateral

To secure its obligations under this Agreement, and until released as provided herein, Seller hereby grants to Buyer a present and continuing first-priority security interest (“Security Interest”) in, and lien on (and right to net against), and assignment of, as applicable, the Project Development Security and Delivery Term Security, to the extent provided in the form of cash, and any other cash collateral and cash equivalent collateral posted pursuant to Sections 11.1, 11.2, and 11.3, and any and all interest thereon or proceeds resulting therefrom or the liquidation thereof, whether now or hereafter held by, on behalf of, or for the benefit of Buyer, and Seller agrees to take all action as reasonably requires in order to perfect the Security Interest in, and lien on (and right to net against), such collateral and any and all proceeds resulting therefrom or from the liquidation thereof.

61
<!-- Page 225 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

(a) Exercise any of its rights and remedies with respect to the Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security as applicable, including any such rights and remedies under Law then in effect;

(b) Draw on any outstanding Letter of Credit issued for its benefit and retain any cash held by Buyer as Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security, as applicable; and

(c) Liquidate all Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security (as applicable) then held by or for the benefit of Buyer free from any claim or right of any nature whatsoever of Seller, including any equity or right of purchase or redemption by Seller.

Buyer shall apply the proceeds of the collateral realized upon the exercise of any such rights or remedies to reduce Seller’s obligations under this Agreement (Seller remains liable for any amounts owing to Buyer after such application), subject to Buyer’s obligation to return any surplus proceeds remaining after these obligations are satisfied in full.

11.4 Letters of Credit

If the Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security is a Letter of Credit and the issuer of such Letter of Credit (a) fails to maintain the minimum Credit Rating set forth in the definition of Qualified Issuer, or (b) fails to honor the secured Party’s properly documented request to draw on such Letter of Credit by such issuer, then the posting Party shall have ten (10) Business Days to either post cash or deliver a substitute Letter of Credit that meets the requirements set forth in the definition of Seller Letter of Credit or Buyer Letter of Credit, as applicable.

If the Seller or issuer of such Letter of Credit indicates its intent not to renew such Letter of Credit, and the Letter of Credit will expire prior to the end of the Term, the Seller will provide a replacement security prior to the expiration of such Letter of Credit.

12. FORCE MAJEURE

12.1 Effect of Force Majeure

62
<!-- Page 226 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

A Party shall not be considered to be in default in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than the obligations of a Party to make payment of amounts due under this Agreement) when and to the extent such Party’s performance is prevented by a Force Majeure that, despite the exercise of due diligence, such Party is unable to prevent or mitigate; provided the Party has given a written detailed description of the full particulars of the Force Majeure that are then known to the other Party reasonably promptly after becoming aware thereof, or reasonably promptly after the date that such Party should have become aware of, the Force Majeure) (the “Force Majeure Notice”), which Force Majeure Notice shall include information with respect to the nature, cause and date and time of commencement of the Force Majeure, and the anticipated scope and duration of the delay. Failure of the claiming Party to provide written notice as required in the preceding sentence constitutes a waiver of a Force Majeure claim for all periods prior to other Party’s receipt of such written notice. The Party providing the Force Majeure Notice shall be excused from fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement until such time as the Force Majeure has ceased to prevent performance or other remedial action is taken, at which time the Party shall promptly notify the other Party of the resumption of its obligations under this Agreement. In no event shall either Party be obligated to compensate the other Party or any other Person for any losses, expenses or liabilities that such other Party or such other Person may sustain as a consequence of any Force Majeure.

### 12.2 Meaning of Force Majeure

The term “Force Majeure” means any act or event, including any act of God or the elements, strike or labor disturbance, act of the public enemy or criminal activity, sabotage, war, terrorism, blockade, insurrection, riot, civil disturbance, fire, storm or flood, lightning, hurricane, tornado, ice storm, hail, earthquake, volcanic eruption, extreme or unusual weather events, explosion not caused by the affected Party, epidemic or pandemic and the efforts of any Governmental Authority to combat such events including quarantine, change in law or any order, restraint, directive, regulation or restriction imposed by Governmental Authority or any military or lawfully established civilian authorities, landslide, mudslide, New PV Trade Measure Event, WRO Restraint, a delay in the issuance of any permits needed for the Project, including any rights-of-way by the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management for any Shared Facilities to be used by the Project, or any similar event or occurrence (i) which prevents one Party from performing any of its obligations under this Agreement or

63
<!-- Page 227 -->

delays such performance, (ii) which could not reasonably be anticipated (other than New PV Trade Measure Events and WRO Restraints) and/or avoided as of the date of this Agreement, (iii) which is not within the reasonable control of, or the result of negligence, willful misconduct, breach of contract, intentional act or omission or wrongdoing on the part of the affected Party (or any subcontractor or Affiliate of that Party, or any Person under the control of that Party or any of its subcontractors or Affiliates, or any Person for whose acts such Affiliate or subcontractor is responsible), and (iv) which by the exercise of due diligence the affected Party is unable to overcome or avoid or cause to be avoided; provided nothing in this clause (iv) shall be construed so as to require either Party to accede or agree to any provision not satisfactory to it in order to settle and terminate a strike or labor dispute in which it may be involved. Any Party rendered unable to fulfill any of its obligations by reason of a Force Majeure shall exercise reasonable efforts to remove such inability with reasonable dispatch within a reasonable time period and mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure. The relief from performance shall be of no greater scope and of no longer duration than is required by the Force Majeure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Force Majeure does not include any of the following (each an “Unexcused Cause”): (1) any requirement to meet a renewable portfolio standard or any change (whether voluntary or mandatory) in any renewable portfolio standard that may affect the value of the Energy purchased hereunder; (2) events arising from the failure by Seller to construct, operate or maintain the Project in accordance with this Agreement, unless such failure was itself caused by an event of Force Majeure; (3) any increase of any kind in any cost, except to the extent associated with a New PV Trade Measure; (4) delays in or inability of a Party to obtain financing or other economic hardship of any kind; (5) Seller’s ability to sell any Products at a price in excess of that provided in this Agreement or Buyer’s ability to purchase any Products at a price less than that provided in this Agreement; (6) failure of third parties to provide goods and services essential to a Party’s performance, unless such failure was itself caused by an event of Force Majeure; (7) Project or related equipment failure of any kind unless caused by a Force Majeure (8) any changes in the financial condition of Buyer, Seller, the Lender or any subcontractor or supplier affecting the affected Party’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement; or (9) a determination by either Party’s governing body.

12.3 Buyer Excuse
<!-- Page 228 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

For purposes of this Agreement, a Force Majeure shall be deemed to excuse Buyer from receiving Energy at the Delivery Point if the Force Majeure is not related to the Project, is declared by Buyer, and prevents Buyer from receiving Energy from the Project.

**12.4 Termination Due to Force Majeure Event**  
If based on a Force Majeure Notice provided by a Party (the “Claiming Party”), the other Party (the “Non-Claiming Party”) reasonably concludes that a Force Majeure or its impact on the Claiming Party affecting more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the Project will continue (i) for a period of three hundred and sixty-five (365) or more consecutive days, then the other Party (the “Non-Claiming Party”) shall have the right to terminate this Agreement effective upon notice to the Claiming Party provided, however, that if the Claiming Party provides documentation to the Non-Claiming Party reasonably demonstrating that the foregoing more than seventy-five percent (75%) for three hundred sixty-five (365) days or more consecutive days standard is satisfied, and if the Non-Claiming Party does not provide any response to the Claiming Party within ninety (90) days after receipt of such documentation, then the Claiming Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the Non-Claiming Party. Upon any termination pursuant to this Section 12.4, neither Party shall owe any damages, Damage Payment, or Termination Payment under this Agreement in respect of such termination or the Force Majeure, and Buyer shall return the Project Development Security or Delivery Term Security, as applicable, to Seller. Any termination of this Agreement in the circumstances described in this section shall be without prejudice to the rights and remedies of either Party for defaults occurring prior to such termination, if any.

**13. INDEMNITY**  
**13.1 Indemnity by Seller**  
Seller shall defend, release, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives against and from any and all losses, claims, demands, liabilities and expenses, actions or suits, including reasonable costs and attorney’s fees, resulting from, or arising out of or in any way connected with claims by third parties associated with the acts or omissions of Seller, its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives relating to this Agreement; excepting only such

Buyer shall defend, release, indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives against and from any and all losses, claims, demands, liabilities and expenses, actions or suits, including reasonable costs and attorney’s fees resulting from, or arising out of or in any way connected with claims by third parties associated with acts or omissions of Buyer, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and representatives, relating to this Agreement; excepting only such loss, claim, action or suit to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Seller, its agents, employees, directors or officers.

**14. LIMITATION OF DAMAGES**

LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO DIRECT ACTUAL DAMAGES ONLY; SUCH DIRECT ACTUAL DAMAGES SHALL BE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES OR DAMAGES AT LAW OR IN EQUITY ARE WAIVED UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED. EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO INDEMNIFICATION OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 13, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PART OF AN EXPRESS REMEDY OR MEASURE OF DAMAGES HEREIN, OR INCLUDED IN A LIQUIDATED DAMAGES CALCULATION SPECIFIED HEREIN). THE AFTER-TAX VALUE OF ANY LOST TAX BENEFITS AND THE COSTS OF RECAPTURE OF ANY TAX BENEFITS OR CREDITS, IF ANY, ARE CONSIDERED DIRECT DAMAGES. UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, AND SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 13 (INDEMNITY), IT IS THE INTENT OF THE PARTIES THAT THE LIMITATIONS HEREIN IMPOSED ON REMEDIES AND THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES BE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES RELATED THERETO, INCLUDING THE

15.2 General Covenants

Each Party covenants that throughout the Term:

(a) It shall continue to be duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation;

![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

(b) It shall maintain (or obtain from time to time as required, including through renewal, as applicable) all regulatory authorizations necessary for it to legally perform its obligations under this Agreement; and

A Party may change its addresses by providing notice of same in accordance with this provision. All written notices shall be directed as shown in Exhibit I. Either Party may request a change to Exhibit I as necessary to keep the Exhibit I information current.

17. SET OFF

![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

19. MOBILE-SIERRA

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither Party may seek to revise the rates, terms or conditions of service of this Agreement, prospectively or retroactively, through application or complaint to FERC under any of the Federal Power Act, absent written consent of the other Party. Nor, absent the prior written consent of the other Party, may a Party, directly or indirectly, support any third party seeking to revise the rates, terms or conditions of service of this Agreement under any provision of the Federal Power Act. Because the rates, terms and conditions of this Agreement are fixed for the duration of the Agreement and are the product of arms’ length bargaining, absent prior agreement in writing by both Parties, the standard of review for changes to the rates, terms or conditions of service of this Agreement proposed by a Party, a non-Party or the FERC acting sua sponte shall be the “public interest” application of the “just and reasonable” standard of review set forth in United Gas Pipe Line Co. v. Mobile Gas Service Corp., 350 US 332 (1956) and Federal Power Commission v. Sierra Pacific Power Co., 350 US 348 (1956).

20. ASSIGNMENT

20.1 No Assignment Without Consent

Except as specified below in this Article 20, neither Party shall assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Each Party shall reimburse the other Party for its out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000), incurred in connection with any such assignment, or requested assignment, including in connection with obtaining required consents.

20.2 Permitted Assignments and Changes in Control

20.2.1 Permitted Assignments

20.2.1.1 Notwithstanding Section 20.1, consent shall not be required for:

(a) Any transfer, sale, pledge, encumbrance, or assignment of this Agreement or the accounts, revenues, or proceeds hereof by Seller to Lenders.

69
<!-- Page 233 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

(b) Any assignment or transfer of this Agreement by Seller to an Affiliate of Seller, provided that such Affiliate’s creditworthiness is equal to or better than that of Seller, as reasonably demonstrated by Seller in a written notice to Buyer notifying Buyer of such assignment or transfer and Buyer concurs and such concurrence shall not be unreasonably withheld;

(c) Any assignment or transfer of this Agreement by Seller to a Person succeeding to all or substantially all of the assets of Seller, provided that such Person’s creditworthiness is equal to or greater than that of Seller, as reasonably determined by Buyer; or

(d) Any assignment or transfer of this Agreement by Seller to any assignee (including any Affiliate of Seller) that is a Permitted Transferee.

20.2.2 Change of Control  
Any direct or indirect Change of Control of Seller (whether voluntary or by operation of law) is deemed an assignment and will require the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a Change of Control of Seller shall not require Buyer’s consent if (i) the Seller after such Change of Control is Controlled by any Lender, (ii) the entity that is the Seller at the conclusion of the Change of Control is a Permitted Transferee, or (iii) such Change of Control is, or is a result of, a direct or indirect Change of Control of NEOP or NEP. For avoidance of doubt, a Change of Control shall not be deemed to have occurred as a result of a Permitted Transfer, and no consent is required under this Agreement with respect to a Permitted Transfer.

20.3 Buyer Limited Assignment  
Buyer may request that Seller enter negotiations to permit Buyer’s limited assignment in connection with a municipal prepayment transaction of all or a portion of Buyer’s rights to receive certain Products (which shall not be for a retail sale, and which shall not include the right to schedule or dispatch the Project or any portion of the Product, or any right to act as Scheduling Coordinator for the Project or to offer any portion of the Product into the CAISO markets) and Buyer’s obligations to make payments for such Product under this Agreement to J. Aron and Company, LLC (“J. Aron”) or other third party at any time (together with J. Aron, each a “Limited Assignee”) upon not less than thirty (30) days’ notice by delivering a written request for such assignment. The limited assignment shall not introduce, or purport to convey or otherwise allege, any right of
<!-- Page 234 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

**Buyer or Limited Assignee** to make any prepayment to Seller under the Agreement or to file or impose any lien on the Project, or otherwise modify any provision of this Agreement, and shall be expressly subject to the Limited Assignee’s timely payment of amounts due under this Agreement with respect to the assigned Product. Buyer shall pay Seller for any payments not timely made by Limited Assignee, and Buyer shall remain obligated to perform all of its obligations under this Agreement notwithstanding the limited assignment, including any credit-related requirements, and payment for all amounts due and owing under this Agreement, including the total gross amount due to Seller under each invoice. Any failure by the Limited Assignee to make payments to Seller when due hereunder shall be a Buyer Event of Default if not cured within the applicable cure period specified in this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, following any request by Buyer, (a) Seller, Buyer and the Limited Assignee shall negotiate in good faith the execution of a limited assignment agreement based on the form attached hereto as Exhibit O, (b) if requested by Seller, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith an indemnity and/or a legal opinion, to be provided by Buyer for the benefit of Seller, in form and substance satisfactory to Seller and its Lenders (if any), including that Seller shall not be required to agree to any terms or conditions which are reasonably expected to have an adverse effect on Seller or its Lenders, and (c) Limited Assignee shall provide such credit support or performance assurance for its obligations as Seller may reasonably require. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in connection with such limited assignment, if (1) the assignment, transfer or conveyance of the assigned Product pursuant to such limited assignment, or (2) Seller’s performance of any obligation under the assignment agreement, fails to meet any requirements of this Agreement, then Seller shall not be deemed to be in breach of any obligation in this Agreement, including without limitation any representation or warranty herein. Limited Assignee and Buyer shall comply with all reasonable requests received by Seller or any Lender in connection with such limited assignment, including providing any reasonably requested acknowledgments with respect to any Collateral Assignment Agreement.

**20.4 Lender Accommodations**

**20.4.1 Consents and Estoppel Certificates**  
To facilitate Seller’s efforts to obtain financing to construct and operate the Project, Buyer will, as soon as reasonably practicable after a reasonable request, cooperate reasonably with Seller and any Lender to provide such consents to

assignments, estoppels, certifications, representations, information or other documents as may be reasonably requested by Seller or such Lender in connection with any financing of the Project, including in connection with any pledge of the membership interests in Seller or its upstream Affiliates to a Lender as collateral for a financing involving the Project. Upon written request of Seller, Buyer agrees to execute a Consent to Collateral Assignment among Buyer, Seller, Seller’s Affiliate, and any Lenders substantially in the form attached as Exhibit L, with such additional changes thereto as such assignee parties may reasonably request and as to which the Buyer shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its agreement. Buyer also agrees to execute customary estoppel certificates for the benefit of Seller and/or any Lenders as reasonably requested from time to time substantially in the form attached as Exhibit P, with such additional changes thereto as such Lender parties may reasonably request and as to which the Buyer shall not unreasonably withhold or delay its agreement.

## 20.4.2 Portfolio Financing

Seller may, without the prior written consent of Buyer, finance all or any portion of the Project, interconnection facilities, or Shared Facilities utilizing debt financing, equity financing (including tax equity), lease financing, or any other form of financing or any combination thereof, including pursuant to a portfolio financing of multiple energy generation, storage, and transmission facilities and other assets of Seller or Seller’s Affiliates (which may include cross-collateralization or similar arrangements).

## 20.4.3 Lender Cure Rights

Buyer agrees that: (i) Buyer will provide the Lenders with notice of any Event of Default by Seller; (ii) for a period of thirty (30) days following the expiration of any cure period for a monetary Event of Default by Seller and ninety (90) days following the expiration of any cure period for a non-monetary Event of Default by Seller, such Lenders, or their designees, will have the right, but not the obligation, to perform any act required to be performed by Seller under this Agreement to prevent or cure the Event of Default and such act performed by the Lenders, or their designees will be as effective to prevent or cure an Event of Default as if done by Seller; and (iii) Buyer will not terminate this Agreement if any Lenders have provided notice to Buyer that they must foreclose on the

72
<!-- Page 236 -->
![SMUD Power Purchase Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SMUD+Power+Purchase+Agreement)

Facility prior to preventing or curing any Event of Default by Seller giving rise to such termination. In the event of a conflict between this Section 20.4.3 and an executed Consent to Collateral Assignment, the terms of the executed Consent to Collateral Assignment shall govern.

**FORM OF CONSENT TO COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT**

This CONSENT TO COLLATERAL ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT (this “Consent”), dated as of __________, 20[__], is executed by and among [NAME OF CONTRACTING PARTY], a [legal form of Contracting Party] organized under the laws of the State of [__________] (the “Contracting Party”), [__________], a [__________] (the “Project Owner”), and [__________], as collateral agent (in such capacity, together with its successors and permitted assigns, the “Collateral Agent”) for various financial institutions named from time to time as Lenders under the Credit Agreement (as defined below) and any other parties (or any of their agents) who hold any other secured indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the Credit Agreement (the Collateral Agent and all such parties collectively, the “Secured Parties”).

A. The Project Owner owns, operates and maintains [_________________].

B. The Contracting Party and the Project Owner have entered into the agreement specified in Schedule I hereto (as further amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof and hereof, the “Assigned Agreement”).

C. The Borrower, the Project Owner, the other affiliates of the Borrower as Guarantors, various financial institutions named therein from time to time as Lenders, [__________], as the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, have entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of [__________] (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”), providing for the extension of the credit facilities described therein.

D. As security for the payment and performance by the Project Owner of its obligations under the Credit Agreement and the other Financing Documents (as defined below) and for other obligations owing to the Secured Parties, the Project Owner has assigned all of its right, title and interest in, to and under, and granted a security interest in, the Assigned Agreement to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Assignment and Security Agreement, dated as of [__________] between the Project Owner and the Collateral Agent (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof, the “Security Agreement”, and, together with the Credit Agreement and any other financing documents relating to the issuance of the Notes, the “Financing Documents”).

E. It is a requirement under the Credit Agreement that the Project Owner cause the Contracting Party to execute and deliver this Consent.

NOW, THEREFORE as an inducement for Lenders to make the Loans, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which is hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

Exhibit L - 1
<!-- Page 268 -->
1. **Consent to Assignment.** The Contracting Party hereby acknowledges and consents to the pledge and assignment of all right, title and interest of the Project Owner in, to and under (but not its obligations, liabilities or duties with respect to) the Assigned Agreement by the Project Owner to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Agreement.

2. **Representations and Warranties.** The Contracting Party represents and warrants as follows as of the date hereof:

   (a) **No Amendments.** [Except as described in Schedule I hereto,] there are no amendments, modifications or supplements (whether by waiver, consent or otherwise) to the Assigned Agreement, either oral or written.

   (b) **No Previous Assignments.** The Contracting Party affirms that it has no notice of any assignment relating to the right, title and interest of the Project Owner in, to and under the Assigned Agreement other than the pledge and assignment to the Collateral Agent referred to in Section 1 above.

   (c) **No Termination Event: No Disputes.** After giving effect to the pledge and assignment referred to in Section 1, and after giving effect to the consent to such pledge and assignment by the Contracting Party, there exists no event or condition (a “Termination Event”) that would, either immediately or with the passage of time or giving of notice, or both, entitle either the Project Owner or the Contracting Party to terminate the Assigned Agreement or suspend the performance of its obligations under the Assigned Agreement. [Except as set forth on Schedule III hereto,] there are no unresolved disputes between the parties under the Assigned Agreement. All amounts due under the Assigned Agreement as of the date hereof have been paid in full [, except as set forth on Schedule III hereto].

3. **Right to Cure.**

   (a) From and after the date hereof and unless and until the Contracting Party shall have received written notice from the Collateral Agent that the lien of the Security Agreement has been released in full, the Collateral Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, following an Event of Default by the Project Owner under the Assigned Agreement, to pay all sums due under the Assigned Agreement by the Project Owner and to perform any other act, duty or obligation required of the Project Owner thereunder as described in Section 3(c) below; provided, that no such payment or performance shall be construed as an assumption by the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party of any covenants, agreements or obligations of the Project Owner under or in respect of the Assigned Agreement.

   (b) The Contracting Party agrees that it will not (i) terminate the Assigned Agreement or (ii) suspend the performance of any of its obligations under the Assigned Agreement without first giving the Collateral Agent notice and opportunity to cure as provided below. The Contracting Party further agrees that it will not assign any obligation under the Assigned Agreement without the prior consent of the Collateral Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except to the extent the Contracting Party may subcontract such obligations to other parties.

**Exhibit L - 2**
<!-- Page 269 -->
![Exhibit L - 3](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Exhibit+L+-+3)  
(c) If a Termination Event shall occur, and the Contracting Party shall then be entitled to and shall desire to terminate the Assigned Agreement or suspend the performance of any of its obligations under the Assigned Agreement, the Contracting Party shall, prior to exercising such remedies or taking any other action with respect to such Termination Event, give written notice to the Collateral Agent of such Termination Event. Collateral Agent will have the right, but not the obligation, to cure a Termination Event on behalf of Project Owner, only if Collateral Agent sends a written notice to Contracting Party before the later of (i) the expiration of any cure period under this Agreement, and (ii) fifteen (15) Business Days after Collateral Agent’s receipt of notice of such Termination Event from Contracting Party, indicating Collateral Agent’s intention to cure. If the Collateral Agent elects to exercise its right to cure as herein provided, it shall have a period of thirty (30) days after receipt by it of notice from the Contracting Party referred to in the preceding sentence in which to cure the Termination Event specified in such notice if such Termination Event consists of a payment default, or if such Termination Event is an event other than a failure to pay amounts due and owing by the Project Owner (a “Non-monetary Event”) the Collateral Agent shall have a period of sixty (60) days after receipt by it of notice from the Contracting Party referred to in the preceding sentence in which to cure the Termination Event so long as the Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing appropriate action to cure such Termination Event (or such longer additional period if the Collateral Agent is unable to cure such Termination Event within such sixty (60) day period despite exercising commercially reasonable efforts, not to exceed a total of thirty (30) additional days); provided, however, that (i) if possession of the Project is necessary to cure such Non-monetary Event and the Collateral Agent has commenced foreclosure proceedings, the Collateral Agent will be allowed a reasonable time to complete such proceedings, and (ii) if the Collateral Agent is prohibited from curing any such Non-monetary Event by any process, stay or injunction issued by any governmental authority or pursuant to any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding or other similar proceeding involving the Project Owner, then the time periods specified herein for curing a Termination Event shall be extended for the period of such prohibition; provided, further, that in the event of items (i) or (ii) above, such time period shall not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days. Any cure period for the Collateral Agent shall not commence until the later of (i) the end of the cure period of the Project Owner under the Assigned Agreement and (ii) written notice from the Contracting Party to the Collateral Agent of a Termination Event.  
(d) Any curing of or attempt to cure any Termination Event shall not be construed as an assumption by the Collateral Agent or the other Secured Parties of any covenants, agreements or obligations of the Project Owner under or in respect of the Assigned Agreement.  
(e) Following a Termination Event by the Project Entity under the Assigned Agreement, the Contracting Party may require the Collateral Agent, if the Collateral Agent has provided the notice set forth in subsection (c) above, to provide to Contracting Party a report concerning:  
(i) The status of efforts by Collateral Agent to develop a plan to cure the Termination Event;  
(ii) Impediments to the cure plan or its development;  
<!-- Page 270 -->
![Exhibit L - 4](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Exhibit+L+-+4)  
(iii) If a cure plan has been developed, the status of the cure plan’s implementation (including any modifications to the plan as well as the expected timeframe within which any cure is expected to be implemented); and  
(iv) Any other information which Contracting Party may reasonably require related to the development, implementation and timetable of the cure plan.  

Collateral Agent must provide the report to Contracting Party within fifteen (15) calendar days after Notice from Contracting Party requesting the report. Contracting Party will have no further right to require the report with respect to a particular Termination Event after that Termination Event has been cured.

**FORM OF LIMITED ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT**

This Limited Assignment Agreement (this “Assignment Agreement” or “Agreement”) is entered into as of [___], 20__ (the “Limited Assignment Agreement Effective Date”) by and among [___], a [___] (“PPA Seller”), [___], a [___] (“PPA Buyer”), and [___], a [___] (“Limited Assignee”), and relates to that certain PPA defined in Appendix 1 hereto. Unless the context otherwise specifies or requires, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Agreement have the meanings set forth in the PPA.

In consideration of the premises above and the mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, PPA Seller, PPA Buyer and Limited Assignee (the “Parties” hereto; each a “Party”) agree as follows:

1. **Limited Assignment and Delegation.**

   a. PPA Buyer hereby assigns, transfers and conveys to Limited Assignee all right, title and interest in and to the rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA to receive delivery of, or have made available to it, the products described in Appendix 1 (collectively, and subject to the exclusions specified in Appendix 1, the “Assigned Product”) during the Assignment Period (as defined in Appendix 1), as such rights may be limited or further described in the “Further Information” section in Appendix 1 (the “Assigned Product Rights”). All other rights of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly reserved for PPA Buyer.

   b. PPA Buyer hereby delegates to Limited Assignee the obligation to pay for all Assigned Product that is actually delivered or made available to Limited Assignee pursuant to the Assigned Product Rights during the Assignment Period (the “Delivered Product Payment Obligation”) and together with the Assigned Product Rights, collectively the “Assigned Rights and Obligations”. All other obligations of PPA Buyer under the PPA are expressly retained by PPA Buyer, including without limitation payment for any Product which is not included in the Assigned Product and any other amounts (including without limitation for Deemed Delivered Energy) owed under the PPA. To the extent Limited Assignee fails to pay for any Assigned Product by the due date for payment set forth in the PPA, PPA Buyer remains responsible for such payment, and it will be a Buyer Event of Default pursuant to PPA Section 10.1.1.1 if PPA Buyer does not make such payment within five (5) Business Days of receiving notice of such non-payment from PPA Seller.

   c. Limited Assignee hereby accepts and agrees, and PPA Seller hereby consents, to the assignment, transfer, conveyance and delegation described in clauses (a) and (b) above.

d. All scheduling of Assigned Product and other communications related to the PPA shall take place between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller pursuant to the terms of the PPA; provided that during the Assignment Period (i) title to Assigned Product will pass from PPA Seller to Limited Assignee upon delivery or making available by PPA Seller of Assigned Product in accordance with the PPA; (ii) PPA Buyer is hereby authorized by Limited Assignee to and shall act as Limited Assignee’s agent with regard to scheduling Assigned Product; (iii) PPA Buyer will provide copies to Limited Assignee of any Notice (as defined in the PPA) of a Force Majeure Event or Event of Default or default, breach or other occurrence that, if not cured within the applicable grace period, could result in an Event of Default contemporaneously upon delivery thereof to PPA Seller and promptly after receipt thereof from PPA Seller; (iv) PPA Buyer will forward copies to Limited Assignee of all invoices provided to PPA Buyer, provided that date is 10 days prior to the payment due date for a monthly invoice will be resolved solely between PPA Buyer and PPA Seller and therefore PPA Seller will not be obligated to deliver copies of any communications relating thereto to Limited Assignee. PPA Buyer shall promptly reimburse PPA Seller for any additional costs or expenses reasonably and actually incurred by PPA Seller as a result of this subsection (d).

e. PPA Seller acknowledges that (i) PPA Buyer and Limited Assignee have advised PPA Seller that Limited Assignee intends to immediately transfer to any Assigned Product received from PPA Seller through one or more intermediaries such that all Assigned Product will be re-delivered to PPA Buyer, and (ii) Limited Assignee has the right to purchase receivables due from PPA Buyer for any such Assigned Product. To the extent Limited Assignee purchases any such receivables due from PPA Buyer, Limited Assignee may transfer such receivables to PPA Seller and apply the face amount thereof as a reduction to any Delivered Product Payment Obligation; provided, however, that (A) at no time shall PPA Seller be required to pay Limited Assignee for any amounts by which any such receivables exceed any Delivered Product Payment Obligation, (B) any such application by Limited Assignee shall not affect any amounts due and owing under the PPA by PPA Buyer (which, for clarity purposes, includes any amount of Delivered Product Payment Obligation not paid by Limited Assignee as a result of any such application by Limited Assignee under this Section 1(e)), including under any invoice, and (C) at all times, PPA Buyer remains liable to PPA Seller for all amounts due and owing under the PPA, including the total gross amount due to PPA Seller under each invoice.

f. At least three (3) Business Days before the commencement of the Assignment Period, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Guarantor”) will issue, in favor of PPA Seller, a guaranty of Limited Assignee’s payment obligations under this Assignment Agreement substantially in the form of Appendix 2 attached hereto (the “Guaranty”). PPA Seller may draw upon, apply, or make demand under
<!-- Page 282 -->
![Exhibit O - 3](attachment://Exhibit_O_-_3.png)

the Guaranty to recover any unpaid amounts due from Limited Assignee and not timely paid as set forth herein; provided, however, that PPA Seller’s rights under the Guaranty and this subsection (f) shall not reduce or affect PPA Buyer’s obligation to render payments when due under the PPA or extend any deadlines in the PPA.

g. Except as set forth in Section 1(h) of this Assignment Agreement, and except as expressly set forth in Section 1(a) of this Assignment Agreement with respect to the Product delivery obligations, nothing in this Agreement modifies or amends any rights or obligations of PPA Buyer and PPA Seller under the PPA, including with respect to CAISO revenues and costs; provided that, for avoidance of doubt, nothing set forth in this Assignment Agreement affects PPA Buyer’s liabilities and obligations to PPA Seller under the PPA, including if Limited Assignee fails to perform.

h. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Assignment Agreement including without limitation the immediately preceding Section 1(g) (with respect to the phrase “nothing in this Agreement modifies or amends any rights or obligations of PPA Buyer and PPA Seller under the PPA”) and Section 6(i) hereof, the Parties hereby agree that if (1) the assignment, transfer or conveyance of the Assigned Product pursuant to this Assignment Agreement, or (2) PPA Seller’s performance of any obligation under this Assignment Agreement, including without limitation if PPA Seller makes any change to the recipient of the WREGIS Certificates as directed by Limited Assignee and PPA Buyer pursuant to Appendix 1 hereof, fails to meet any requirements of the PPA, then PPA Seller shall not be deemed to be in breach of any obligation in the PPA, including without limitation any representation or warranty therein.

v) failure of the Guaranty provided by the Guarantor to PPA Seller hereunder to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with its terms) prior to the indefeasible satisfaction of all obligations of Limited Assignee hereunder or if the Guarantor provides notice of termination of the Guaranty or otherwise repudiates, disaffirms, disclaims, or rejects, in whole or in part, or challenges the validity of the Guaranty; or

vi) neither Limited Assignee nor the Guarantor maintains a Credit Rating equal to or greater than Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from S&P, and if ratings by S&P and Moody’s are not equivalent, the lower rating shall apply (a “Required Credit Rating”).

b. The Assignment Period will end at the end of the last delivery hour on the date specified in the termination notice provided pursuant to Section 2(a), which date shall not be earlier than the end of the last day of the calendar month in which such notice is delivered if termination is pursuant to clauses (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above. All Assigned Rights and Obligations shall revert from Limited Assignee to PPA Buyer upon the expiration or early termination of the Assignment Period, provided that (i) Limited Assignee shall remain responsible for the Delivered Product Payment Obligation with respect to any Assigned Product delivered or made available to Limited Assignee prior to the end of the Assignment Period, and (ii) any legal restrictions on the effectiveness of such reversion (whether arising under bankruptcy law or otherwise) shall not affect the expiration or early termination of the Assignment Period.

c. The Assignment Period will automatically terminate upon the expiration or early termination of the PPA.

3. Representations and Warranties. The PPA Seller and the PPA Buyer represent and warrant, each with respect to itself only, to Limited Assignee, as of the Limited Assignment Agreement Effective Date, that (a) the PPA is in full force and effect; and (b) no event or circumstance exists (or would exist with the passage of time or the giving of notice) that would give either of them the right to terminate the PPA or suspend performance thereunder. Limited Assignee represents and warrants to PPA

**Appendix 2**  
**Form of Guaranty**  

**[]**, 2023  

**NAME**  
**ADDRESS**  

Attention:  

Ladies and Gentlemen:  

For value received, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (the “Guarantor”), a corporation duly organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, hereby unconditionally guarantees the prompt and complete payment when due, whether by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations and liabilities, whether now in existence or hereafter arising, of J. Aron & Company, LLC, a subsidiary of the Guarantor and limited liability company duly organized under the laws of the State of New York (the “Company”), to **COUNTERPARTY NAME** (the “Counterparty”) arising out of or under the Limited Assignment Agreement among the Company, the Counterparty and [PPA Buyer] dated as of [___], 2024. This Guaranty is one of payment and not of collection.  

The Guarantor hereby waives notice of acceptance of this Guaranty and notice of any obligation or liability to which it may apply, and waives presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any such obligation or liability, suit or the taking of other action by Counterparty against, and any other notice to, the Company, the Guarantor or others.  

Counterparty may at any time and from time to time without notice to or consent of the Guarantor and without impairing or releasing the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder: (1) agree with the Company to make any change in the terms of any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (2) take or fail to take any action of any kind in respect of any security for any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty, (3) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against the Company or others, or (4) compromise or subordinate any obligation or liability of the Company to Counterparty including any security therefor. Any other suretyship defenses are hereby waived by the Guarantor.  

This Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect until the opening of business on the fifth business day after Counterparty receives written notice of termination from the Guarantor. It is understood and agreed, however, that notwithstanding any such termination this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect with respect to the obligations and liabilities set forth above which shall have been incurred prior to such termination.  

**Exhibit O - 9**

![Exhibit O - 10](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Exhibit+O+-+10)

The Guarantor further agrees that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any of the guaranteed obligations, or interest thereon is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by the Counterparty upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or reorganization of the Company. No failure on the part of the Counterparty to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Counterparty of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power.

No term or provision of this Guaranty shall be amended, modified, altered, waived or supplemented except in a writing signed by Guarantor and Counterparty.

The Guarantor hereby represents as follows:

(a) The Guarantor is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has full power and authority to execute and deliver this Guaranty.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Guaranty have been and remain duly authorized by all necessary action and do not contravene any provision of the Guarantor's certificate of incorporation or by-laws, as amended to date, or any law, regulation, decree, order, judgment, resolution or any contractual restriction binding on the Guarantor or its assets that could affect, in a materially adverse manner, the ability of the Guarantor to perform any of its obligations hereunder.

(c) All consents, licenses, clearances, authorizations, and approvals of, and registration and declarations with, any governmental or regulatory authority necessary for the due execution and delivery of this Guaranty have been obtained and remain in full force and effect and all conditions thereof have been duly complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with, any governmental or regulatory authority is required in connection with the execution or delivery of this Guaranty.

This Guaranty constitutes the legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with all of its terms and conditions (subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar law affecting creditors’ rights generally). The enforceability of the Guarantor’s obligations is also subject to the effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

The Guarantor may not assign its rights nor delegate its obligations under this Guaranty, in whole or in part, without prior written consent of the Counterparty, and any purported assignment or delegation absent such consent is void, except for (i) an assignment and delegation of all of the Guarantor’s rights and obligations hereunder in whatever form the Guarantor determines may be appropriate to a partnership, corporation, trust or other.

organization in whatever form that succeeds to all or substantially all of the Guarantor's assets and business and that assumes such obligations by contract, operation of law or otherwise, and (ii) the Guarantor may transfer this Guaranty or any interest or obligation of the Guarantor in or under this Guaranty, or any property securing this Guaranty, to another entity as transferee as part of the resolution, restructuring or reorganization of the Guarantor upon or following the Guarantor becoming subject to a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, resolution or similar proceeding. Upon any such delegation and assumption or transfer of obligations, the Guarantor shall be relieved of and fully discharged from all obligations hereunder, whether such obligations arose before or after such delegation and assumption or transfer.

THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW. GUARANTOR AGREES TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, OVER ANY DISPUTES ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY.

In the event the Guarantor becomes subject to a proceeding under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together, the "U.S. Special Resolution Regimes"), the transfer of this Guaranty, and any interest and obligation in or under, and any property securing, this Guaranty, from the Guarantor will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under such U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Guaranty, and any interest and obligation in or under this Guaranty, were governed by the laws of the United States.

**PRINCIPLES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT**

SMUD is committed to developing carbon free Renewable Energy in a manner that supports the community, protects the environment, and respects human rights. This document provides guidance on the key objectives that SMUD expects to achieve associated with this commitment. Renewable energy projects engaged in a commercial relationship with SMUD such as a Power Purchase Agreement will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, implement, and maintain throughout the Term, a Community Benefits Plan that addresses how the project will achieve the key objectives identified herein.

**Key objectives:**

1. **Land Use:** Prioritize previously developed lands. Avoid or minimize impacts on sensitive environmental resources, including but not limited to cultural resources, Tribal cultural resources, and biological resources such as endangered species habitat, vernal pools and other sensitive habitats, Waters of the US, Waters of the State and waters identified by CDFW as Streambed. Provide additional mitigation measures if avoidance and minimization measures cannot fully eliminate impacts. Applicants are expected to discuss these topics with SMUD and the lead agency as early as possible to identify potential associated issues in advance of the purchase power agreement being finalized.

2. **Land Use:** All projects should employ techniques for maintaining and/or restoring ecosystem function to the site in conjunction with Renewable Energy outcomes, including establishment of native vegetation, restricting use of herbicides and pesticides, use of grazing for vegetation management and seasonally appropriate maintenance practices. Where development is on or surrounded by agricultural lands the project should also employ agricultural practices on the property during operations including sheep grazing, dry crop farming and irrigated food production where feasible.

3. **Land Use:** Employ design and construction practices that minimize ground disturbance to the maximum extent possible. This is especially critical in areas where cultural, Tribal and biological resources are of significant concern.

4. **Sustainable Life Cycle Management:** Include plans for sustainable life cycle management of construction materials and project components during construction and operation that provides for recycling and reuse of construction waste and waste during operation including but not limited to the solar panels.

5. **Community Benefits:**
   (a) **Inclusive Economic Development:** Leverage SMUD’s Supplier Education & Economic Development (SEED) team to connect with certified small business vendors/contractors in SMUD’s service territory to support the project. Submit requests to seed.mgr@smud.org.

**Exhibit Q - 1**
<!-- Page 295 -->
6. **Zero Carbon Workforce Development**: SMUD seeks to galvanize and prepare the region for an inclusive, diverse, creative, and empowered future workforce. Leverage SMUD’s existing workforce development agreements, programs, and partnerships throughout the Project to support the development of a clean energy labor force. The Project Team will work with SMUD to engage various elements of the labor supply chain via pre-apprentice and apprenticeship programs, internships, informational sessions, and mentorship opportunities.

7. **Sustainable Materials & Equipment**: Sourcing materials and equipment from companies that have a human rights policy and statement of supply chain ethics commitment that expresses the corporation’s commitment to meet the responsibility to respect human rights and uphold ethical business practices in their operations and value chains.

# 3 Pre-Test Meeting, Notifications & Check

## 3.1 Pre-Test Meeting
Notification will be provided 10 days prior to testing and a pre-test meeting may be held between relevant representatives from NextEra and Off-Taker Entities. If a meeting occurs, notes of the meeting will be taken by NextEra and submitted to the attendees.

## 3.2 Pre-functional checks
Pre-functional checks will be performed for all equipment and the corresponding functional check sheets will be reviewed by NextEra prior to the start of Performance Testing. Any functional issues that occur during Capacity Testing will be entered into the Commissioning Log by a NextEra representative and will be referenced in the Capacity Test Report. Capacity Testing will be performed when the following conditions are satisfied:

- Weather conditions required to support collection of appropriate range and quantity of test data
- Utility grid voltage is stable and within ±5% of design voltage
- There is grid connectivity at each inverter such that a Capacity Test can be accomplished under load
- The site is substantially complete and the systems are in automatic operation.

1. \( C_t = \) module power temperature coefficient \((-0.xxx\%/°C, \text{ Weighted Average})\)  
   \( T_M = \) mean module surface temperature (°C)

2. A plot of \( P_{STC} \) vs. mean Reference Module irradiance is created as shown in Figure 1.

3. A linear fit is then performed for all Valid Data Points (shown in BLUE) while all other data points (shown in RED) are excluded from the regression. These RED data points represent discrete times in the data set where one or more event is present as defined in Section 5 Table 3 of this procedure. The coefficient of determination (\( R^2 \)) for the capacity regression shall be at least 0.92. The linear fit yields an equation of the following form:

   \[
   y = N * x + b
   \]

   where:  
   \( y = P_{STC} \) power (temperature corrected)  
   \( N = \) slope of the line  
   \( x = \) mean Reference Module irradiance (W/m²)  
   \( b = \) y intercept  

   **Note:** A Valid Data Point is defined as an instantaneous, 1-minute sample of plant data which has not been excluded according to the guidelines in Section 5.

4. The Tested Capacity is determined by evaluating the equation at 1,000 W/m²:

   \[
   \text{Tested Capacity} = y(1000)
   \]

# 6 Capacity Test Execution

## 6.1 Daily Capacity Test

A capacity value for each calendar day of the Capacity Test period will be calculated according to the procedure outlined in Section 4, using data points subjected to the exclusions described in Section 5.

For each calendar day of the test, the NextEra Test Manager will do the following:

- Confirm all inverters start up at approximately the same time
- Ensure that data is recorded in 1 minute intervals
- Review the Daily Alarm Log and other non-conformance items and ensure that they do not affect the test results

## 6.2 Tested Capacity

The Tested Capacity of the PV Power Plant will be determined using all Valid Data Points collected over the Capacity Test period. The Tested Capacity value will be calculated according to the procedure outlined in Section 4, using data points subjected to the exclusions described in Section 5. This value will be compared to Guaranteed Capacity shown in Section 1, Table 1 to determine pass/fail.

## 6.3 Site Specific Test Configuration (Optional)

**Site Pre-Test Assumptions:**
1. xxxx
2. xxxx
3. xxxx

**Site Testing Configuration:**
1. xxxx
2. xxxx
