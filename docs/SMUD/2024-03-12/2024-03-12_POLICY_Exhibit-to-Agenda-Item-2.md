# GP-2 Governance Focus

The Board will govern with an emphasis on: 
(i) outward vision rather than an internal preoccupation; 
(ii) encouragement of diversity in viewpoints; 
(iii) strategic leadership more than administrative detail; 
(iv) clear distinction of Board and CEO roles; 
(v) collaborative rather than individual decisions; 
(vi) the future rather than past or present; and 
(vii) proactive thinking.

## Specifically:

a) The Board will cultivate a sense of group responsibility. It will be responsible for excellence in governing. The Board will be an initiator of policy and use the expertise of individual members to enhance the ability of the Board as a body.

b) The Board will direct, evaluate and inspire the organization through the establishment of written policies reflecting the Board’s values. The Board’s major policy focus will be on SMUD’s intended impacts outside the organization, not on the administrative or programmatic means of achieving those effects.

c) Continual Board development will include orientation of new Board members in the Board’s governance policies and processes, periodic re-orientation of existing Board members, and regular Board discussion of process improvement.

d) The Board will regularly discuss and evaluate its performance. Self-monitoring will include comparison of Board activities and discipline to policies adopted by the Board. It will be up to the Board president or committee chair to determine the appropriate manner of this feedback and evaluation.
