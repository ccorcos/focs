1. Background  
   Strategic Direction SD-6, Safety Leadership states that:  
   Creating a safe environment for employees and the public is a core value of SMUD.  

   Through best practice methods and continuous improvement, SMUD will be recognized as a leader in employee safety while also assuring the safety of the public related to SMUD operations and facilities. SMUD commits to a proactive approach, including the active involvement of SMUD leadership, employees, contractors, and the community, as well as comprehensive monitoring of organizational and public safety performance.  

   Therefore, SMUD will continuously improve safety results related to:  
   a) Workplace Safety  
   i) Reduce SMUD’s injury severity incidents to 13 or less than by 2025, as measured by OSHA’s Days Away Restricted Time (DART), a rate that demonstrates top quartile safety performance for similar size utilities using the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) work-related safety data.  
   ii) Provide timely, quality health care for injured employees that aids their recovery while maintaining positive financial performance of the workers’ compensation program.  

   b) Contractor Safety  
   i) Support contractors to reduce and eliminate potential hazards for Serious Injuries and/or Fatality (SIF) when conducting high risk work.  

   c) Public Safety  
   i) Track and report injuries to the public related to SMUD operations or facilities.  
   ii) Implement measures to protect the public from injuries related to SMUD operations or facilities.  

2. Executive Summary  
   a) SMUD is in compliance with the SD-6 direction and is in alignment with SMUD’s new 5-year strategy of working toward a zero-incident culture.  

   Workplace Safety  
   SMUD recorded 42 OSHA Recordables injuries in 2023. Seventeen of the 42 OSHA injuries (10 Lost Time & 7 Modified Duty cases) resulted in a 0.79 DART rate. Ergonomic injuries in the field contributed to 45% of all injuries. Knee, shoulder, and back have been identified as the most common injured body parts for the field.

This past year continued to present challenges with COVID-19. COVID-19 has not only impacted the way SMUD is getting work done but has also resulted in new and emerging legislation surrounding paid leave and workers’ compensation liabilities for COVID related injuries. Despite these challenges SMUD’s program remains strong and continues to lead when compared with similarly situated organizations. No COVID-19 claims were made in 2023.

**Contractor Safety**

SMUD continues to utilize ISN to evaluate safety records and performance for high-risk contractors. This evaluation focuses on Contractor Fatality History, OSHA Citation History, DART, and Total Recordable Incident Rates (TRIR), Insurance Experience Ratio, Safety Culture Questions, and Safety Program Review. Currently SMUD has 110 contractors in the ISN system.

This past year we substantially increased the number of site safety evaluations for high-risk contractors to validate safety performance on the job sites. Safety completed 454 site safety visits through the 4th Quarter of 2023 and exceeded the 2023 goal of 200 evaluations. These site visits focused on SMUD contractors who work with Power Generation, Environmental Services, Line, Substation, Facilities and Vegetation Management on projects where high-risk work is performed. This work includes high voltage work, working at heights, vegetation management, confined spaces, excavations, etc. Additionally, we have fully integrated the use of the Safety Management System (SMS) for inspections, incident tracking, reporting and investigations of SMUD contractors. This allows SMUD to verify safe working practices by our contractors to reduce the potential for serious injuries or property damage. Contractor reported incidents which required an investigation to be completed, and typically will warrant additional site safety visits to verify corrective measures have been put into place to reduce further occurrences.

In addition, SMUD Procurement and Safety have partnered to enhance contract language as it relates to contractor safety requirements, Request for Proposal (RFP).

**templates for high-risk work and incorporating contractor safety as part of the onboarding process.**

**Public and Community Safety**  
SMUD tracks public and community incidents in the Safety Incident Tracking System (SITS) involving car-pole, electrical contact, dig-in incidents, and injuries to the public that are related to SMUD’s operations or facilities. For the entire year of 2023, there were 253 incidents where the public struck a SMUD asset with a vehicle, with four fatalities from such events. Seventy-two dig-ins have been reported with no injuries. Two electrical contacts with one minor injury. Public safety has partnered with local agencies to expand knowledge of the dig in and electrical safety response programs.

**3. Additional Supporting Information**  
The new SD-6 Safety Direction became effective February 2021. Our goal is to achieve the desired performance objectives by year-end 2025. This report summarizes the first half of the 2023 safety performance.

**Safety Leadership.**  
The Safety Team continues with its integration efforts to support Executive Leadership’s 5-year plan that emphasizes zero incidents and injuries and a focus on a zero-incident safety culture. SMUD’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Paul Lau, re-emphasized the need to improve safety at SMUD with a greater focus on improving our “Safety for Life” culture, reducing the risk of serious injuries and fatalities, implementing a safety management system (SMS), and improving the analysis of injury and incident trends. These goals and strategies are outlined in SMUD’s Safety Road Map and Enterprise Strategy, which was revised in 2023.

**Safety Management System (SMS).**  
During 2023, Safety continued to focus on optimization of Benchmark Gensuite the new Safety Management System (SMS). The Safety team continue to enhance applications within the system to better fit SMUD needs. New processes are being automated and introduced to employees within various applications in SMS. This includes the recording of field tailboards, safety inspections, supervisor employee interactions, EMF meter loans, contractor safety audits and injuries, office, and field ergonomics, and more. Customized dashboards have been created for field tailboards and Supervisor employee interactions.

**Safety Standards Development.**  
SMUD’s safety team continues to update Health & Safety Standards, as an on-going continuous improvement process, to provide a foundation for the organization’s World Class Safety initiatives.

The SMUD’s safety team also updated the COVID-19 IIPP Appendix, due to regulatory updates from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and Cal/OSHA regulations, which were minimized the COVID-19 requirements. This ensures compliance for our Injury Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) and COVID-19 protocols. Information on the updates is continuing to be provided to all SMUD personnel in various formats, including Safety Meetings, ENN’s, on-site electronic monitors, and drop-in meetings.

**process to the Safety Management System (SMS).** Emphasis is placed on field visits for work with the highest hazard potential. SMUD’s safety team continues our efforts in visiting crews throughout SMUD, to assist with employee safety concerns, processes, procedures, and equipment. For office personnel, an emphasis is placed on observing personnel pertaining to ergonomic risk, and slip/trip/fall hazards in walking areas. During 2023, a total of 11,008 Supervisor-Employee interactions were complete that resulted in a 133% percentage observed.

**Near Miss Reporting.** Leadership continues to support and encourage near miss and positive observation/good catch reporting. The goal of this process is to identify opportunities for learning, to prevent incidents from occurring. During 2023, 180 near miss and positive observation/good catch reports were recorded in the Safety Management System (SMS).

**Safely Conducted Observations Reduce Common Hazards (SCORCH). Engagement & Trending Data**  
Throughout the second half of 2023, a total of 2217 employees were observed under the Office & Professional process. Head/Neck posture was the top safe and at-risk behavior during this time frame. Our Behavior Highlights acknowledge the good job employees showed for keeping head in neutral postures in alignment with ears over shoulders at a high percentage. Risk Reduction Reminders stressed the importance of proper monitor height settings to avoid sustained awkward postures (chin to chest and/or chin to sky) of the head/neck area. The value of micro breaks, frequent stretching, and elevated awareness towards the later part of the day or work week was also part of the conversation.

Under the Electrical Trades and CFAS-Field process, a total of 2202 field employees were observed. Behavior Highlights were related to the high consistency employees showed for protecting their head and feet while performing job tasks. Hard Hat and Footwear tied as the top safe behaviors. Risk Reduction Reminders focused on the at-risk behavior of Situational Awareness. Guidance was provided related to the behavioral benefits of constantly updating information pertaining to surroundings for potential moving and changing hazards to the work area (e.g., stray dogs, agitated people, unlawful activity). Positively promoted how preparing for the unexpected aids in making informed decisions to successfully address events, should they occur.

**SCORCH Safety for Life promotions included the following:**
- After attending Dekra’s 2023 Safety in Action Conference in April. Committee members held a two-day (In-person/virtual) SCORCH Mini Conference to share best practice. Presentations were provided to all employees highlighting personal ownership and awareness for working safely. Topic shares ranged from Accountability for Yourself & Others, Stuff Happens and Fending off Fatigue. Positive feedback related to the relevancy of topics was received from employees and leadership in attendance.
- Digital Campaigns - Highlighting the ease and efficiency in which observations can be completed via the Safety Management System “7 Minutes for Safety” continued.
- SCORCH successfully expanded its behavior influencing ability through the promotion of two photo contest events. It was a fun way for employees to include family members as well as themselves showcasing awareness for demonstrating safe behaviors at home and at play. SMUD employees are engaged in a wide variety of activities and hobbies, with the

4. Challenges

COVID-19. The safety of our employees is of utmost importance, so we continue to monitor SMUD COVID-19 cases and manage prevention efforts. In 2023 SMUD Safety, People, Services, & Strategies, and the Communications updated the COVID-19 guidance to meet regulatory changes within the Cal-OSHA Emergency Temporary Standard for facial coverings, testing programs, quarantine, and isolation guidelines to protect employees, contractors, and the public. SMUD continues to provide employees with COVID-19 antigen testing at our EC-OC Med Services clinic. Our third-party vendor Axiom Medical continues to handle employee contact tracing and this process has been working well. In order to improve our employee experience, the Safety dept. led the roll out of a new mobile app that allows employees to log positives cases and receive guidance at any time. During Q3/Q4 2023, SMUD has received notifications of 151 COVID positive cases from staff. As required both contact tracing and notification of potential exposures have occurred with all personnel impacted.

Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs). The SMUD Safety Team continues to partner with business units to reduce all WMSD’s. Ergonomic evaluations are conducted in the office, field, and virtually to meet the needs of the workforce. From July through December the Ergonomics Team conducted 186 ergonomic evaluations that were requested through Concern Reporting for a total of 369 for the year. Data collection enhancements to the Ergonomic Evaluator application went live in the 3rd quarter and will provide insight on ergo trends across SMUD. The Ergonomic Initial and Refresher Training for office employees was updated to reflect the new hybrid workforce. In addition, Safety continues to partner with SCORCH to utilize data to reduce potential soft tissue injuries.

Injury Prevention Outpost (IPO) program also known as Field Ergo program continues to show improve with field forces. After an initial group training during the monthly safety meetings for the various work groups to share the program details, our ergonomic experts continue to visit job sites and provide the field crew(s) with specific or personal, one-on-one assistance, covering stretching techniques; providing ergo support tools; identifying awkward postures, excessive/forceful exertions, and repetitive motions. This program originally started within Line Division and has been also requested by operational areas.

5. Recommendation

SMUD is committed to becoming a recognized leader in safety. Both SMUD’s leadership team and employees recognize that to achieve success we must integrate safety into all that we do. It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-6.
<!-- Page 12 -->
6.  Appendices - Business Segment Safety Program Improvement Initiatives

**Energy Delivery and Operations.** The SMUD’s safety team started a “World Class Safety” program in 2023, utilizing the Energy Delivery & Operation Strategic Plan’s Key Objectives, as the messaging, to “drive a culture of safety in pursuit of zero accidents.” Utilizing the 2023 Safety and Reliability tactics, the Safety Team worked with the smaller field-based work groups (i.e., Meter Shop, Veg Management, Telecom, Haz Mat/Network/Substations, and CMI/Survey), and other teams, such as Fleet and Warehouse, to identify foundational Leading Indicators to track progress throughout the year. These included: Monthly Vehicle Inspections (ensuring a vehicle is road-worthy), Supervisor Crew Visits and Safety Team Crew Visits (putting eyes on work and having safety conversations with field crews), SCORCH observations (providing the time and support to field crews for participation and identifying barriers) and ensuring field crew members completed their annual bundled safety training, resulting in the following: 916 Monthly Vehicle Inspections completed; 469 Crew Visits; and 110 Bulk Substation Inspections being completed. In 2024, the safety team will continue to work with business units on the foundational efforts above and continue to build a World Class Safety Program. The original foundational efforts were chosen, as they reflected employee accountability and safe behaviors in which to improve on. In 2024, the safety team added activities focusing on the employee and the Supervisor working together on safety improvements and collaboration. For example, Safety Risk Assessment (SRAs) usage will be added; Supervisor and Safety Crew visits will focus on quality, not just quantity, to identify potential safety hazards, process improvements, and good catches, which will be shared during safety meetings and other communication methods. The safety team will also focus on improvements of the Lock Out/Tag Out (LOTO) Programs for each of the work groups, which requires LOTO. This will include a review of the program, ensure the proper locks are available to the employees, and the programs are being correctly adhered to.

The quarterly World Class Safety meetings with work group leadership, will continue to provide a regular cadence to review our collaborative safety efforts, seek additional opportunities and topics to focus and improve upon, and SMUD to become the leader in World Class Safety.

In continuing our collaboration with the Sacramento Power Academy, the safety team has continued to identify opportunities to improve our internal safety training and ensure continued and consistency quality. Recently, the safety team identified opportunities to include custom videos into training to enhance the end user experience. Technology continues to advance in the training spectrum and utilization of videos will provide the opportunity to include examples from Subject Matter Experts (SME’s) performing work safely, in “classroom” or safety meeting presentations as well as enhance the delivery of safety content, throughout the organization.

Joint Labor Management Safety Committees (JLMSC) continue to evolve with an “All field teams’ approach” which allows for the sharing of safety and equipment ideas and mitigation controls, programs, and procedures re-development within our organization. In addition, the JLMSC affords SMUD employees to review utility best practices by benchmarking and/or lessons learned.

![SMUD's Flame Retardant (FR) Clothing program continues to help our employees stay safe while perform high risk task. SMUD's vendor continues to deliver on a regular basis for the field forces in our EC-OC yard, which reduces our field forces from driving to and from the vendor many store locations. This continues to provide a significant cost savings (time, gas, and driver risk reduction) for SMUD. Our safety efforts helped eliminate hundreds of individual driver trips back and forth. The Field forces feedback and response continues to be positive and appreciative.](https://example.com/image1)

**Safety for Life.** SMUD's Safety and Environmental Day returned this past year after postponing for three years during the COVID-19 pandemic. The event took place at Safety Center in the Safetyville town. The highlighted events we scheduled were pedestrian safety, bicycle safety, a driving simulator as well as a CPR class. There were over 145 attendees which included SMUD employees and their families.

Sparky's Crew continues to get families involved in safety by sending postcards and quarterly newsletters to SMUD families enrolled.

We continue to place emphasis on personal shares in our Safety for Life communications. In 2023, 23 different articles were shared across SMUD. Examples of article topics include: winter driving, heart health, eyes on path, mental health and eye protection. Quarterly Safety for Life meetings have returned to in-person with the option for Teams as well as an online meeting that can be taken at the employees’ convenience.

**Zero Carbon Energy Solutions (ZCES).** Power Generation has continued to prioritize employee safety while ensuring critical work is completed. In addition to Power Generation employees continue with their Daily Dozen morning stretches for soft tissue injury reduction, the safety team is also working with them to revamp their Quarterly Safety Meetings, their Leadership Meetings; and their annual bundled safety training (with the SPA Team).

Currently, our OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Site Safety Coordinator continues to work as a liaison between the contractor and the Hydro Operations crews, to ensure the findings are being addressed and completed, as a requirement to maintain the Cal/OSHA VPP status. As a reminder: VPP is designed to recognize employers and their employees who have implemented safety and health programs which effectively prevent and control occupational hazards. These programs go beyond the minimum required Cal/OSHA regulations and provide the best feasible protection at the site. Achieving this status ensures Hydro Operations will continue with safety process improvements as the annual comprehensive safety audits are performed by the third-party contractor.

VPP establishments are considered leaders in the field of workplace safety and health. The management commitment and employee participation are key elements in achieving VPP recognition. Applications within the Safety Management System are being utilized by Hydro Operations to ensure employees have a convenient avenue to participate in safety related activities and to track improvement.

ergonomic injuries. Fleet switched to Geotab as their new fleet tracking system. To improve safe driving awareness, Fleet developed a dashboard to share metrics of assigned fleet vehicles with various business units. Fleet began electronic monthly vehicle inspections on SMS for fleet-assigned vehicles. Fleet also rolled out electronic housekeeping inspections on Inspection Tool on SMS. Fleet completed 100% of their bundled training in October. Fleet employees continue to participate in EV training courses customized to suit SMUD’s needs in preparation for the transition to an all-electrified fleet by 2030.

All business units continue to partner in a consultative collaborative development of a World Class Safety program as OneSMUD with quarterly meetings addressing leading and lagging indicators and the latest safety observation trends across the enterprise.

Driver Safety. Supervisors are conducting side-by-side ride alongs to provide coaching and safe driving skills guidance. While Safety was able to provide additional in-person classroom and behind the wheel Smith System training. Driving Rodeos continue to be in high demand and the new partnership with Safety Center turned out to be a big success. In 2023 Safety hosted Driving Rodeo events for Substation, Network, Elec. Techs., and Revenue Operations. Safety has increased the sharing of driving-safety related topics at ED&O Safety meetings this year and is working on new safe-driving messaging materials for the ECCO Yard, HQ and Fresh Pond parking areas, as well as for digital displays at each location. Additionally, a refresh of the safe driving decals on Fleet vehicles is under way. Safe driving is being emphasized in vehicle reports that are provided to directors and managers who have frequent drivers. The reports are focused on speeding as well as seatbelt violations with the potential of more driving details to be added. Driving Rodeo planning for Line Division is currently underway for 2024.

**SMUD BOARD POLICY**  
**Category:** Governance Process  
**Policy No.:** GP-2  
**Title:** Governance Focus  

The Board will govern with an emphasis on: (i) outward vision rather than an internal preoccupation; (ii) encouragement of diversity in viewpoints; (iii) strategic leadership more than administrative detail; (iv) clear distinction of Board and CEO roles; (v) collaborative rather than individual decisions; (vi) the future rather than past or present; and (vii) proactive thinking.

Specifically:

a) The Board will cultivate a sense of group responsibility. It will be responsible for excellence in governing. The Board will be an initiator of policy and use the expertise of individual members to enhance the ability of the Board as a body.

b) The Board will direct, evaluate and inspire the organization through the establishment of written policies reflecting the Board’s values. The Board’s major policy focus will be on SMUD’s intended impacts outside the organization, not on the administrative or programmatic means of achieving those effects.

c) Continual Board development will include orientation of new Board members in the Board’s governance policies and processes, periodic re-orientation of existing Board members, and regular Board discussion of process improvement.

d) The Board will regularly discuss and evaluate its performance. Self-monitoring will include comparison of Board activities and discipline to policies adopted by the Board. It will be up to the Board president or committee chair to determine the appropriate manner of this feedback and evaluation.

# SMUD BOARD POLICY

**Category:** Governance Process  
**Policy No.:** GP-4  
**Title:** Board/Committee Work Plan and Agenda Planning  

To accomplish its strategic leadership consistent with Board policies, the Board will develop and follow an annual work plan that ensures the Board: (i) focuses on the results the Board wants the organization to achieve; (ii) defines the conditions of SMUD that it considers acceptable and unacceptable; (iii) meets its other obligations as stated by law or policy; and (iv) continually improves its performance through education, feedback, and deliberation. The Board work plan shall guide SMUD staff in preparing the agendas for regular board meetings and standing committee meetings.

Specifically:

   i) The Board will develop each year a list of topics and issues that it wishes to explore in the coming years and maintain a work plan that will be regularly reviewed by the Board or a standing committee.  
   ii) The Board President shall ensure that the Board’s agendas meet the goals of the annual work plan.  

b) **Board Agendas**

   ii) Only members of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager (CEO) and his or her designees may place items on the Board agenda.  
   iii) Items for placement on the agenda fall into the following categories:  
   - Items generated by SMUD management;  
   - Items placed on the agenda by a Board member;  
   - Presentations by outside persons or agencies that have received approval for placement on an agenda from the Board President (see Meeting Procedures of the SMUD Board of Directors for details).

When a Board member invites people to speak at a Board meeting during the public comment period, the Board member should notify the Board President in advance of the meeting to ensure the efficient management of public comment.

vi) Items may be placed on the agenda on either the consent calendar or the discussion calendar. An item placed on the consent calendar may be moved from the consent calendar to the discussion calendar at the request of any Board member, prior to a motion and a second on the consent calendar.

vii) A Board member may propose at the beginning of the meeting to pull an item from the agenda. Upon a motion and a second, the Board may vote to approve the agenda as revised.

viii) Matters not on the agenda for a regular meeting will not be considered by the Board at that meeting except: (1) upon determination by a majority of the Board that an emergency situation exists, severely impairing public health and/or safety; or (2) upon a determination by a two-thirds vote of the Board or by a unanimous vote if less than two-thirds of the members are present, that the need to take action arose subsequent to the agenda being posted; or (3) as otherwise permitted under the Ralph M. Brown Act of the California Government Code.

ix) Whenever an item has been approved for consideration by the Board under paragraph b) viii) of this policy, the Board President will read, upon introducing the item for Board consideration, a brief summary which shall include the subject title, a short explanation of the subject matter, and, if any, the recommendation.

x) Matters on the agenda for regular meetings which have not been considered and acted upon at such meetings or continued to a subsequent meeting will be deemed continued to the following regular meeting until they can be relisted as a regular item.

xi) Whenever the Board fails to take action on an item on the Board’s agenda, the Board will set a date for reconsideration of the item. If for any reason the Board fails to set such a date, the Board Secretary will list all such items as a “pending item” on the action item section of the next regular agenda for which the Board Secretary is accepting items.
