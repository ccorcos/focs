# Commercial Paper Program Benefits

**Benefits:**

**Flexibility** to fund capital spending as it arises

- Supports expanded capital spending in support of 2030 Zero Carbon Plan

**Lower initial costs** vs. long-term fixed rates
- Allows for market timing flexibility to refund with long term fixed-rate bonds
- Balances short-term borrowing costs with interest earnings

**Additional liquidity** viewed favorably by the ratings agencies
- Liquidity provides a form of reserve funding and self-insurance for unforeseen events
- AA rating enhanced with larger adjusted total liquidity sources (days cash + commercial paper)
