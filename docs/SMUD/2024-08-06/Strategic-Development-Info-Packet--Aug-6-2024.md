**NARRATIVE:**  

**Requested Action:**  
Brief the Board on SMUD’s **Community Impact Plan**.  

**Summary:**  
SMUD launched the Community Impact Plan (CIP) in September 2022, which underlines our commitment to making meaningful investments in under-resourced communities to ensure their participation in a clean energy future. Our plan acknowledges that under-resourced communities are among the most impacted by climate change. The plan is based on extensive input and feedback from our customers and community.  

The Community Impact Plan addresses three core areas:  

1. To improve the **affordability** of clean energy technology for under-resourced communities, we are offering solutions that are low to no cost to the customer through neighborhood and business district electrification, residential customer offerings, and nonprofit and multi-family electrification programs.  

2. To improve **equitable access** to the benefits of a clean energy transition, we are increasing access to zero carbon job opportunities and ensuring that regional workforce development programs are available. We are partnering with community-based organizations, including ethnic chambers, neighborhood homeowner associations and property and business improvement districts -- who are the trusted advisors to our most vulnerable customers.  

3. And to improve **community engagement and education** about our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan, we are providing in-language, customized delivery of content that helps customers understand our vision and meets them where they are on the journey.  

This presentation will provide an overview of the plan and programs, the accomplishments, and a preview of expected outcomes in the next year.
