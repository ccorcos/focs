# Board Monitoring Report 2023
## Strategic Direction
### SD-13, Economic Development

1. **Purpose & Background**

   Strategic Direction 13 (SD-13) Economic Development states that:

   Promoting the economic vitality of our region and the growth of our customer base is a key value of SMUD. Therefore, SMUD shall exercise strategic leadership and actively participate in regional economic development.

   Specifically:
   a) SMUD shall promote innovation while maintaining rate affordability and balancing the other strategic directions.  
   b) SMUD shall align its economic development activities with regional economic development initiatives.  
   c) SMUD shall assist in retaining, recruiting and growing commercial and industrial rate-paying customers.  
   d) SMUD shall offer economic development rates and program incentives.  
   e) SMUD shall offer a contracting program for certified small businesses who are rate-paying customers.  

2. **Executive Summary**

   SMUD is in compliance with SD-13, Economic Development.

   SMUD continues to be a nationally recognized leader for our long-standing commitment to the economic health of the greater Sacramento region. In 2023, we build on the successes in helping businesses recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and worked to mitigate the top main issues faced by our local businesses (which account for over 50% of SMUD’s revenue) through Community Impact Plan (CIP) resources, in-kind support and subject matter expertise to help in mitigating and addressing these challenges. Through CIP, we also expanded and deepened our partnership base to enhance our ability to raise awareness and adoption of the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan for all of SMUD’s service area. We collaborated through key partnerships to support a shared vision of economic recovery while delivering greater collective impact and advancing an inclusive and equitable economy. Additionally, we aligned our economic development efforts with SMUD’s vision to be a trusted and impactful partner in achieving an inclusive, zero carbon economy. We leveraged our relationships to accelerate innovation, ensure energy affordability and reliability, protect the environment, eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, catalyze economic and workforce development, promote environmental justice, and enhance community vitality for all.

   Our strategy to enhance the economic vitality of the Sacramento region is comprehensive. Key tactics to engage, inform and support the regional business community include:

   - Advancing SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Goal in inclusive, regional economic development efforts  
   - Leveraging Community Impact Plan funding to establish key business partnerships in mostly under-resourced business corridors  
   - Broadening support of the region’s innovation ecosystem, including through the Sacramento Economic Growth Alliance (SEGA) and the California Mobility Center (CMC)

- Supporting business formation, attraction, retention, and expansion efforts
- Providing a spectrum of business development resources for entrepreneurs
- Enhancing accessibility to the Supplier Education and Economic Development (SEED) contracting program for local small businesses
- Continuing to offer and enhance economic development rates
- Providing energy efficiency programs and electrification incentives and rebates
- Expanding local agency and nonprofit partnerships to support community development
- Deploying significant resources to support a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility and Sustainable Communities plan that can be replicated and measured for effectiveness and impact
- Ensuring our commercial and industrial service connection costs are in line with other West Coast electric utilities
- Providing subject matter expertise and facilitating (power supply) for the developer community projects

Through outreach and education, SMUD’s Supplier Education and Economic Development (SEED) team teaches local small businesses how to contract with SMUD and positively impact their bottom line. SEED offers incentives to local small businesses that participate in SMUD's competitive bid process. It also helps prime contractors find local sub-contractors, which helps them gain a competitive edge when developing their bids or proposals. In 2023, the SEED team partnered with Supply Chain Services and external partners, coordinating and/or participating in 242 outreach events and facilitating 13 How to Do Business with SMUD (HTDB) educational workshops, resulting in awarding 29% of SMUD’s contracts to SEED-certified small businesses, exceeding the Board-established goal of 20% and increasing SEED program participation by 182 new SEED vendors. 105 SEED contracts were awarded in 2023, totaling more than $103 million dollars.

SMUD works with over 50 local economic development organizations to enhance regional economic vitality. Our leadership roles in the Greater Sacramento Economic Council (GSEC), Valley Vision, Sacramento Metro Chamber, Urban Land Institute, Downtown Sacramento Partnership, Sacramento Black Chamber, Sacramento Hispanic Chamber, Sacramento Asian Pacific Chamber, Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG), Sacramento Public Agency Consortium (SacPAC) and many others help ensure our activities support the region’s efforts to attract, retain and expand companies in our service area. It also means SMUD has a seat at the table early on in economic development conversations. Other major tactics to encourage regional economic development include our dedicated Commercial Development and Commercial Delivery teams.

Business attraction was a key economic development focus in 2023. We participated in 24 business attraction, retention and expansion projects, supporting the attraction/expansion of 10 companies and the creation of an estimated 1,306 local jobs in multiple sectors including corporate headquarters, advanced manufacturing, technology, software development, and food processing.

3. Information about our 2023 efforts to achieve the specific elements outlined in SD-13 is provided in the following section.

a) SMUD shall promote innovation while maintaining rate affordability and balancing the other strategic directions.

Startup businesses and innovative new technologies are vital to creating an inclusive, zero-carbon economy. To help establish and accelerate these ideas into businesses, SMUD collaborates with local non-profit organizations that offer training, maker spaces, networking.

- and mentorship to startups at no cost. SMUD is a visible and reliable member of the ecosystem, often connecting our internal expertise to these outside entities for education, awareness and promotion of workforce opportunities in climate tech.

- CMC had significant changes in its management and staff during 2023, and the strategy for the organization shifted towards focusing more on workforce development training, collaboration and coordination with the local and regional community organization, and delivering on federal and City government grants. The CMC’s new CEO started in November 2023, and, as a result of the change in strategy and direction, the organization’s business activities are now geared towards maintaining and strengthening the existing relationships in the local and regional workforce development business community. The CMC established new partnerships with more than a dozen local and regional partners leveraging SMUD’s existing relationships in the region to collaborate on the workforce development training and job placements. Additional information on the CMC can be found in Appendix A.

- SMUD continues to effectively balance our goal of fostering innovation with our commitment to keeping rates low. SMUD’s average rates will remain competitive even after the adopted rate increases for 2024 and 2025. In 2023, SMUD’s system average rate was 45.5% below PG&E, which includes their 5 rate changes in January, March, June, July and September (+3.3%, +4.4%, -1.8%, +5.3% and +1.5%). A detailed summary of SMUD’s rate competitiveness is provided in Appendix A.

### b) SMUD shall align its economic development activities with regional economic development initiatives.

- SMUD played a leadership role in regional economic development initiatives in 2023.

**Grant Funding:** SMUD played a key role in the Sacramento region receiving over $330 million in federal and state grant funding to advance SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan goals and drive local economic development. Details regarding the grants SMUD received can be located in Appendix B.

**California Jobs First:** SMUD played a key role in the Sacramento region’s implementation of the State’s California Job’s First program (previously referred to as the Community Economic Resilience Fund or CERF). Branded locally as We Prosper Together and administered through Valley Vision, the inclusive economic development initiative’s goal is to uplift communities, encourage investment in the region and create living-wage jobs. SMUD participated in all regional and Sacramento/Yolo sub-regional stakeholder meetings, supported the region’s efforts to draw-down $13 million through the initiative’s Catalyst Fund program providing pre-development project funding to Sacramento. Also, SMUD holds a seat on the Leadership Council overseeing the initiative’s implementation.

**Cap-to-Cap:** SMUD sent a 13-member delegation to the Metro Chamber’s 51st Annual Cap-to-Cap program in Washington D.C. to advocate for issues of regional significance to SMUD and our community partners and to further cultivate relationships with influential elected, business and non-profit leaders from the six-county Sacramento region. SMUD subject matter experts reviewed and contributed content to issue papers related to future mobility, air quality, wildlife and forest management, the CMC and workforce development. Also, SMUD staff served in a leadership capacity as a member of the Steering Committee and incoming chair for the overall program.

![Board Monitoring Report – SD-13, Economic Development](https://example.com/image.png)

**MBARK:** SMUD continued as a lead supporter of the Minority Business Assistance and Recovery Kickstart (MBARK) program, a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach geared to assist minority small business owners in the community. MBARK utilizes understanding and expertise on the needs of minority small business owners and showcases how to proactively engage them in order to stabilize and grow their businesses. In 2023, MBARK provided 1,809 consulting hours to 2,296 separate businesses in SMUD’s service area.

**Property and Business Improvement District (PBID) Outreach:** In 2023, through established formal partnerships, SMUD increased engagement with businesses within 14 PBID districts by 642%, participating in 51 outreach events compared to 5 in 2022. In collaboration with SMUD’s formal PBID partners, EDP conducted 10 targeted business walks within these districts, sharing SEED and 2030 ZCP information in English and applicable translated languages. EDP’s targeted outreach and engagement in these areas resulted in the awarding of eight participating market catering contracts valued at $1.9M to small businesses identified within the districts of SMUD’s formal PBID partners.

**Internal and External Study Missions:** As a member of the steering committees for both the Metro Chamber Study Mission to Toronto, Canada, and the Sacramento Asian Pacific Chamber of Commerce’s Internal Study Mission, SMUD helped set the agenda and drive the dialogue with community leaders around key business issues and promote awareness of SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan.

**Small and Mid-size Business (SMB) Support:** SMUD’s SMB team of Strategic Account Advisors continued to assist our customers by directing them to appropriate SMUD programs and services, as well as educating them on SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan and how they can partner with us to ensure no business or community is left behind. For additional details on the efforts of the SMUD Small & Mid-size Business Team of Strategic Account Advisors, please see Appendix B.

**Greater Sacramento Economic Council (GSEC):** SMUD’s partnership with GSEC is critical to the community as it contributes to regional prosperity by growing the economic base. In addition to Paul Lau’s participation on the GSEC Board, SMUD’s commercial and economic development representatives participate in GSEC’s Economic Development Directors’ Task Force. Given the focus on corporate Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) efforts, and its alignment to SMUD’s 2030 Clean Energy Vision, we have played an increasingly important role in business attraction, retention, expansion and in helping brand the region.

**Sustainable Communities Program:** To promote regional workforce and equitable community development, SMUD continues targeting inclusive economic development, community/environmental health, and neighborhood engagement activities in vulnerable and under-resourced communities through its Sustainable Communities program. SMUD has invested $35.1 million into this effort, leveraging partnerships to increase impact in these areas of need. Additional information regarding Sustainable Communities can be found in Appendix B.

**c)** SMUD shall assist in retaining, recruiting and growing commercial and industrial rate-paying customers.

**Business Attraction:** SMUD provided support in the attraction of 10 new companies that will create 1,306 jobs in SMUD’s service territory.

**Commercial Development:** SMUD actively engaged in 137 commercial, industrial, mixed-use and residential projects throughout our service territory. The team additionally partners with various stakeholders to enhance development opportunities.

**d) SMUD shall offer economic development rates and program incentives.**

In 2023, SMUD offered an Economic Development Rate (EDR) to incentivize the attraction, retention, and expansion of businesses within our service area. A description of the current EDR can be found in Appendix D.

SMUD conducted strategic outreach and engagement to developers and builders of residential subdivisions and multi-family developments about its Smart Homes program offerings and incentives for All-Electric Smart Homes, SolarShares, and battery storage.

**e) SMUD shall offer a contracting program for certified small businesses who are rate-paying customers.**

SMUD’s Supplier Education and Economic Development (SEED) program offered incentives to DGS-certified small businesses within SMUD service area in SMUD’s competitive bid process. We grew the participating SEED vendor base by over 30%, with registered SEED vendors representing 48% of all DGS-certified small businesses in the Sacramento region by the end of 2023. It also helped prime contractors find local subcontractors to gain an advantage in developing their bids or proposals, providing 391 lists of SEED-qualified vendors to contractors in specific categories to leverage the SEED program in their bid responses.

The SEED team held 30 workshops, orientations or panel discussions and coordinated participation in 242 outreach events, participated in 15 business walks, reaching approximately 28,319 individuals.

SMUD’s annual goal is to award no less than 20% of all contracts to certified small businesses. We exceeded that goal in 2023, awarding 29% of contracts to SEED qualified vendors, totaling more than $103 million.

The SEED team also coordinated the Business Advisory Council (BAC) which raises local business awareness about contracting with SMUD and makes recommendations for improvements to our contracting process. SMUD hosts quarterly meetings for over 40 member agencies, including the leads of regional Chambers of Commerce and Property and Business Improvement Districts. For more information about our 2023 efforts to promote our SEED program, and the achievement of our SEED goals, please see Appendix E.

**4. Challenges:** California’s business climate, cost of doing business, decarbonization goals and regulatory standards present challenges to development. Permitting costs and delays pose barriers to market leading companies to relocate to other states. Limited availability of a trained workforce present hurdles to growth. SMUD continues to work with regional and state partners, such as GSEC, The Governor’s office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz) and the California Association of Local Economic Development (CALED), to address the state and local regulatory challenges that limit our ability to attract or develop new businesses.

**5. Recommendation:** It is recommended that the Board accept the Monitoring Report for SD-13, Economic Development.

# APPENDIX A

SMUD shall promote innovation while maintaining rate affordability and balancing the other strategic directions.

SMUD’s approach to innovation includes investments in regional accelerators, incubators, and curriculum delivery that support business development and entrepreneurship with a focus on an inclusive economy. Benefits to the community include job creation, increased revenue, innovation, community involvement, diversity, and greater economic opportunity. The work of these innovation and entrepreneurship partners is highlighted below:

**CleanStart Inc.** assists clean tech companies in the Sacramento region to make their innovations a commercial success and contribute to solving global climate challenges through education, access to capital, and connections. CleanStart coached 41 companies in 59 sessions to develop their ideas and prepare them to pitch to investors and granting agencies to get funded. CleanStart also presented nine (9) regional clean tech companies at the GFX Conference attended by over 1,000 people. This partner held its third Spotlight Investor Pitch Night featuring five (5) investor-ready clean tech companies and launched its third intensive bootcamp for clean tech entrepreneurs, the 16-session CleanStart CEO Crash Course, with eight (8) startups participating.

CleanStart now reaches an audience of over 5000 people with 14 events (662 attendees), a new YouTube Channel (4,227 views), a LinkedIn page (914 views), a monthly newsletter and funding alerts. CleanStart held three (3) networking mixers called PowerUp with 90 attendees. The outreach trailer made it to 12 events in 2023 and engaged 325+ people. In all of its events, CleanStart covered such topics as grant funding, success stories, building decarbonization, wind, solar, long-duration storage, low-carbon fuels, and microgrids.

**Hacker Lab** stands provides multifaceted entrepreneurship support, serving as an all-encompassing makerspace, coworking space, and workforce incubator renowned throughout the region. Its cornerstone programs have made significant strides: MADE Studio emerged as a dynamic studio-style makerspace, offering an impressive lineup of 60 classes monthly, thereby enhancing the skills of 1,200 participants over the year. The MAKER EDU Pathways, a pivotal workforce development initiative, provided eight (8) participants with an invaluable eight-month journey of mentorship, education, and entrepreneurship support. The MAKERS program, a women’s business incubator, celebrated the achievements of 40 women in 2023 with two 8-week small business accelerators, each granting the graduates $40,000 in seed funding. Additionally, Maker Markets continued to attract 10 local makers monthly, while the Women’s Marketplace, held on First Fridays, consistently drew 50 attendees each month.

**InnoGrove** continued to offer networking and educational workshops focused on startup and small business development, hosting 10 events reaching approximately 205 attendees, including Women-in-Tech Workshops and Startup Founder Workshops. InnoGrove also supported the Pitch Elk Grove competition for startups by hosting practice sessions for the Round 16 competition. In addition, a longer-term role for InnoGrove is to provide a location where startup businesses can easily and cost-effectively develop their products with the goal of rolling out their company to larger, stand-alone space as their products grow (and as their team hires more local personnel). InnoGrove had two of these successes - Core Impact and Tiamti Networks started at InnoGrove and grew their team sufficiently to move out into free-standing space during 2023.

**StartupSac** accelerates Sacramento’s startup and innovation ecosystem through educating, empowering, and connecting startups to founders and innovators. This included three Mentor Sacramento Office Hours Sprints, offered in collaboration with the Carlsen Center, which

matched over 170 early-stage entrepreneurs with expert mentors, investors, advisors, subject matter experts. StartupSac held three (3) Scale-Up! Workshops, educating 53 entrepreneurs about term sheets, deal documents and employment agreements. For the first time, StartupSac held its FastTrack entrepreneur 12-week bootcamp where 21 aspiring entrepreneurs learned how to launch a business. In collaboration with Startup Folsom, a monthly Startup Pitch Workshop was launched which provided feedback to 24 startups on their investor pitch decks and was attended by 142 people. In collaboration with the Carlsen Center, StartupSac organized two weekend-long Startup Challenge events which taught the principles of entrepreneurship to over 150 participants. For Capital Region Small Business Week, StartupSac organized a Resource Expo which attracted over 260 participants. For the second year in a row, StartupSac organized Pitch Elk Grove for the city of Elk Grove where 8 companies competed for $17,000 in prize money and nearly 200 people attended. StartupSac held a total of 30 events, which attracted over 1400 attendees, including eight (8) StartupSac Happy Hour Events with 346 attendees.

**Growth Factory** is a nonprofit entrepreneurial development organization with an accompanying early-stage venture fund on a mission to create an entrepreneurial engine that scales high growth companies and catalyzes innovation in the Greater Sacramento region. Growth Factory has supported 85+ startup companies (30% from SMUD service area) through events, programs and activating over 100 mentors. SMUD also supplied thought leadership throughout the programming, particularly in areas of clean tech and operational excellence. The second annual GFX Venture Conference and Startup Showcase (2023 Program) attracted approximately 1000 attendees and featured 64 speakers including a breakout session with SMUD Chief Zero Carbon Officer Lora Anguay. The event also featured a tradeshow floor with 20 participating organizations, including SMUD. The event included the Backyard Awards Lunch in partnership with Stoel Rives, attended by 600 people, at which SMUD had a table and presented an award.

**Carlsen Center for Innovation & Entrepreneurship** at CSU Sacramento hosted the Startup Challenge and Global Entrepreneurship Week (GEW). At the two Startup Challenges, the Carlsen Center supported over 90 participants in either forming a new startup team or supporting the growth of existing startups with 33 final pitches. GEW 2023 featured 15 panels, 4 pitch events, 2 expos, and 1 speed mentoring event, with approximately 400 attendees with a reach of another 100 through LinkedIn live. One panel featured SMUD Director of Customer and Grid Strategy Rachel Huang about the Future of the Zero Emission Vehicle Industry. SMUD also helped host the LevelUp E3 (Equity for Every Entrepreneur) Sacramento Ecosystem Town Hall during GEW.

**FourthWave**, a local accelerator program for women-led technology in collaboration with the Carlsen Center for Innovation & Entrepreneurship, supported 11 startups ranging from agricultural technology to medical technology-based companies. Over 25 mentors, leadership coaches, and subject matter experts supported the cohort over the 16-week program. To date, the FourthWave program has seen their founders raise over $70 million in capital funding as well as 200 new jobs created.

As a member of the **Sacramento Entrepreneurial Growth Alliance (SEGA)**, SMUD meets quarterly to discuss areas to collaborate and grow entrepreneurship in the region. The NorCal Entrepreneur Hub, an online tool/platform connecting entrepreneurs to organizations, resources, and events now highlights over 335 users, 260 organizations, and 461 resources. In September 2023, SMUD was an active partner and sponsor of E3Sacramento to support Equity for Every Entrepreneur. E3 Sacramento, consisted of three days of events, nine workshops and discussions, and 50+ people who engaged in building a more equitable entrepreneurial ecosystem in partnership with National non-profit Forward Cities, with Day 3 being hosted at SMUD. Lastly, SEGA landed one of 13 designations as an Inclusive Innovation Hub by the
<!-- Page 14 -->
![Board Monitoring Report](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Board+Monitoring+Report)

California Office of the Small Business Advocate. This designation is followed by $250,000 in funding towards SEGA efforts.

Our collaboration with California Capital supports the Sacramento Valley Small Business Development Center (SBDC) serving Sacramento County. In 2023, they held 98 events, serving 1,561 businesses. These efforts fostered 88 new business startups and creating 851 full and part-time jobs. The SBDC is a strong annual partner of our Capital Region Small Business Week and of SMUD’s SEED program, promoting public contracting and providing support through their APEX program.

The CMC developed new organizational policies and procedures required under the grant agreements, while it continued to refine its workforce development and training delivery models. The emphasis for 2023 was to optimize the recruiting and training strategies under the Federal and City grants. Strong partnerships were renewed with community-based organizations and a training provider that has a direct line of communication with underrepresented communities. These partners include Waking the Village, Women's Empowerment, Saint John's, Next Move, Greater Sacramento Urban League, Asian Resources, CA Asian Chamber of Commerce, Renewable Gateway and Charles A Jones Training Center. Partnership with the regional industry collaborative organization, Sacramento Valley Manufacturing Alliance, was also strengthened, which includes Siemens Mobility. Approximately 90 people were trained by end of 2023.

![Board Monitoring Report – SD-13, Economic Development](https://example.com/image-url)

State to support ride share drivers and nearby disadvantaged communities. Also included in the total is $50M for SMUD from the DOE for the Connected CleanPower City project.

Connected CleanPower City will adapt infrastructure to interact with technology and customers at the grid's edge, establishing visibility, management, and control. This ecosystem, created through grid and technology enhancements, combined with an existing Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS), will enable real-time grid management of proliferating Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), the accelerated adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X), intelligent buildings, virtual power plants (VPP), battery storage, and electrified neighborhoods. To manage these assets, SMUD is accelerating the integration of Distributed Intelligence (DI) at the Grid Edge, an enhanced Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS), and an advanced Outage Management System (OMS) to maintain and improve grid resiliency.

SMUD also supported Calpine with its $270M application for the Sutter Decarbonization Project will retrofit the Sutter Energy Center, an existing 550- megawatt natural gas combined-cycle energy facility located in Sutter County, California. Working together with ION Clean Energy’s post-combustion carbon capture technology and 1PointFive Sequestration LLC's more than 50 years’ experience safely and securely storing CO2, the Sutter Decarbonization Project is critical to achieving California’s ambitious carbon neutrality goals while maintaining grid reliability and affordable customer rates.

Sustainable Communities Program: Our Sustainable Communities program helps bring environmental equity and economic vitality to all communities in our service area, with special attention given to historically under-resourced neighborhoods. We believe in the ability to make a greater collective impact through partnerships, and collaborate with private industry, government agencies and nonprofits to invest in and implement programs that provide equitable access to indicators of sustainable community success, with a focus on equity and environmental justice, inclusive economic development, clean energy and STEM education, and zero carbon workforce development.

Involvement of all our communities is foundational to our 2030 Zero Carbon Plan. SMUD recognizes the importance of partnering with all the communities we serve. We commit to reaching impacted communities as we work toward our goal of zero carbon. Under-resourced communities lack equitable access to the multiple essential community components necessary to ensure a high quality of life, including but not limited to livable wage employment and training opportunities, affordable housing options, transportation and connectivity, economic development, nutrition, education opportunities, and a healthy environment.

Our Sustainable Communities program strategically establishes long-term partnerships with community-based organizations and small businesses, working together on projects to help our under-resourced communities, increase inclusion and close the disparity gap in the region. These partnerships create trusted relationships and serve as a foundation for the community outreach, engagement, collaboration, and education needed to build livable, diverse, and resilient communities. We partner with policy makers, transit, technology companies, health care providers and community-based organizations, leverage our investments, and create collective impact to enhance workforce training, transportation access, clean energy, job creation and inclusive economic development in under-resourced neighborhoods.

![SMUD's Sustainable Communities Priority Map](https://example.com/image-url)

**SMUD’s Sustainable Communities Priority Map:** To answer the call for a just and equitable clean energy transition, SMUD revised its Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map to include CoolClimate Network, Tree Equity Score, Property and Business Improvement Districts (PBIDs) and other data sets. The Sustainable Communities Resource Priorities Map helps inform resource allocation, reduce growing economic disparity in Sacramento County and ensure the benefits of SMUD’s 2030 Zero Carbon Plan are equitably shared among all communities. SMUD and its partners will better understand where clean energy infrastructure, customer programs, facility improvements, economic development investment and workforce development opportunities need to occur to achieve our ambitious decarbonization goals in an equitable manner.

**Regional Workforce Development Strategic Plan Update:** In 2023, SMUD continued working through the Regional Workforce Development Strategic Plan, with a goal of training at least 3,000 people to position them for clean energy and other economic opportunities and facilitating the employment of at least 1,000 people by the end of 2024. This regional strategy has worked to galvanize and prepare the region with an inclusive, diverse, skilled, and empowered future workforce. Through the Regional Workforce Development Strategic Plan initiatives, SMUD supported 48 community partners to rapidly deploy workforce development and training throughout the Sacramento Region, with a high emphasis on bringing opportunities to under-resourced communities. By fostering a responsive career ecosystem, SMUD continued to close economic equity gaps, build the requisite workforce to meet SMUD’s regional zero carbon goals, and attract new business investments to the region by supporting a skilled and ready workforce.

**Energy Career Pathways:** SMUD’s 2023 Energy Career Pathways recruited and trained individuals from SMUD’s Sustainable Communities target neighborhoods in solar, battery, EV, and electrification technologies. Our 2023 training partners, Grid Alternatives, Northern California Construction and Training Inc., and Cosumnes River College, supported graduates with employment services such as connecting with employers, resume help, and career coaching. Our effort closed the year with 150 individuals graduating and 57 being placed in relatively high-paying jobs. In the broader regional workforce development space, SMUD partnership agreements with 48 community organizations resulted in over 1,905 youth and adults reached with career education and over 750 adults trained in technical skills. SMUD worked with its partners to place 856 of these trainees into new careers. Participants were engaged in a number of industries, with emphasis given to skills and careers that will help SMUD meet its regional zero carbon goals.

**Shine Program:** In its seventh year, the Shine program invests in community nonprofit partners that deliver inclusive and equitable projects through collaborations and partnerships supporting our historically under-resourced communities. In 2023, 84 organizations submitted applications with compelling and competitive projects. We received requests for over $3 million in funding for projects to increase access to zero carbon workforce development trainings and placement, inclusive economic development, clean energy and STEM education, energy efficiency projects, environmental justice and equity. For the 2023-2024 cohort, Shine will fund 29 projects totaling over $593,000. This diverse portfolio of partners will support our under-resourced, under-represented communities, by developing our next generation of zero carbon workforce through.

skills trainings and work placement, increasing clean energy and STEM Education, updating to energy efficient equipment, and improving our natural habitat through environmental justice and equity projects. We will support inclusive economic development with two projects from Franklin Blvd PBID and the Carmichael Improvement District identifying 11 businesses. We will increase access to zero carbon workforce skills programs for 1200 under-represented and under-resourced community members in the region. Also, we will increase our clean energy, STEM education and careers, and environmental justice activities to over 1,900 under-represented youth.

Small and Mid-size Business (SMB) Support: The SMB team came together and performed eight “blitzes,” covering every SMUD ward, where we visited hundreds of small & mid-size businesses to highlight topics ranging from SAA introductions, SEED vendor applications, storm preparation, kitchen electrification, and summer time-of-day education. Further, in close collaboration with Economic Development & Partnership, SMB members joined 21 business walks and attended or spoke at over 50 community events and association meetings so we could meet our customers “where they are” and share our vision for a zero-carbon future.

The SMB team hosted six kitchen electrification demonstrations to educate dozens of our commercial customers on the health, financial, and labor-saving benefits of all-electric kitchens. Attendees included restaurant owners, neighborhood associations, community partners, and even SMUD colleagues interested in learning about available technology.

Finally, SMB SAAs, in close collaboration with Sustainable Communities, Economic Development & Partnerships, and Advanced Energy Solutions, worked to bring Community Impact Plan (CIP) funding to members of the Del Paso Boulevard Property & Business Improvement District (PBID). The SMB team researched and shared information with dozens of business owners and community members at several events and onsite meetings and helped walk them through the process of applying for commercial funding for electrification and energy efficiency projects at their businesses. The SMB team was critical to the process as building trust, answering concerns, coordinating site visits, and providing ongoing education and strategic advice to our commercial customers in underserved areas is paramount to moving a project from application to completion. The lessons learned in Del Paso will guide and inform our 2024 strategy as we move from Business District Electrification pilot to program.

Energy Efficiency: Our Complete Energy Solutions (CES) and Express Energy Solutions (EES) programs were positioned well to lead electrification and energy efficiency projects for SMB customers in 2023. SMB customers continued to take advantage of a comprehensive list of incentive opportunities available through EES. Additionally, SMB customers utilized the ease of the CES program implementing turnkey solutions for them to complete energy projects. Many commercial customers were able to participate in both energy efficiency and Go Electric measures where they received incentives for multiple measures, saving money while reducing their carbon footprint. Program managers from both EES and CES contributed and participated in quarterly Business Go Electric campaigns and community engagement events. Overall, CES and EES successfully completed 254 projects with our SMB customers in 2023.

Numerous operators reported a positive turn in the industry with the beginning of a market stabilization, an increase to wholesale pricing and overcoming challenges faced in 2021 and 2022. Notably, our largest indoor facility came online boasting an 82,000 square foot facility, employing over 80 fulltime employees hired mostly from the Sacramento area and bringing over 2.8MW of new load.

APPENDIX D

SMUD shall offer economic development rates and program incentives.

SMUD offers economic incentives to help attract new businesses and expand existing ones to grow the regional economy. Incentives range from helping design new construction to offering energy-efficient upgrades for equipment to proposing our Economic Development Rate (EDR).

Economic Development Rate: Customers that exceed 299kW for three consecutive months may qualify for the EDR. This rate has multiple options for our customers, including a frontloaded rate to help reduce initial operating costs, or a fixed discount over the ten-year period. Customers who locate in a disadvantaged community have the same options, but with a larger discount. Additionally, the Greater Sacramento Economic Council verifies the economic impact of the project. This ensures the customer is aware of other economic development.

The SEED team focused its efforts on the following key outreach initiatives:

- **Business Walks:** The SEED team conducted 15 business walks throughout the region with an emphasis on high priority areas identified on the SC Priorities Map. Business walks helped the SEED team build trust through repeated customer outreach, identifying language barriers and increasing SEED participation.

- **Expanding Education:** The SEED team developed a Proposal Writing 101 workshop and will launch this new educational offering in 2024. Proposal Writing 101 acts as a Part Two to the SEED team’s "How to do Business with SMUD" workshop. Proposal Writing 101 provides general best practices, definitions and tips for small businesses new to government contracting.
<!-- Page 21 -->
- **PBID Partnerships:** In 2023, through established formal partnerships, SMUD increased engagement with businesses within 14 PBID districts by 642%, participating in 52 outreach events compared to 7 in 2022. In collaboration with SMUD's formal PBID partners, Economic Development & Partnerships (EDP) conducted 10 targeted business walks within these districts, sharing SEED and 2030 ZCP information in English and applicable translated languages. EDP's targeted outreach and engagement in these areas resulted in the awarding of 8 sheltered market catering contracts valued at $1.9M to small businesses identified within the districts of SMUD's formal PBID partners.

- **Business Advisory Committee (BAC):** SEED hosted four quarterly meetings in 2023 for BAC business organization leaders, raising awareness about the SEED program, the 2030 Zero Carbon Plan, best practices, sponsored events, incentives, commercial programs and contracts awarded to BAC members' constituents. In 2023, SEED hosted its inaugural BAC mixer providing BAC members an additional opportunity to connect and engage in a less formal setting. **How to Do Business with SMUD:** The SEED team used virtual formats and collaborated with community partners to deliver 12 educational workshops on SMUD's procurement program and promote SEED participation opportunities.

The successful event drew 304 registrants, offering 100+ 1:1 matchmaking sessions, two panel discussions, one roundtable and 15 exhibitors. The event was very well-received, resulting in 10 new SEED vendors, 125 1:1 match-making participants, 12 new Power Voice participants and a 59% increase in Ariba open solicitation views.

- **SEED Marketing Updates/Translations:** The SEED team assisted with translating SEED and Meet the Buyers materials into two additional languages, providing marketing materials in Russian and Ukrainian.

- **Sheltered Market Initiatives:** The SEED team continually explores innovative ways to foster small business participation in solicitations and worked closely with Supply Chain to identify a sheltered market contracting opportunity in the area of professional services. The contracts are specific only to verified SEED vendors and resulted in 13 suppliers being awarded a total of $3,198,000 in potential award dollars.

- **SEED Quarterly Newsletter:** The SEED team distributed over 285 electronic copies of the quarterly newsletter to external partners and SEED Ambassadors to highlight information on SEED program resources, contracting opportunities, free government contracting services, SEED supplier success stories, recent contract awards, upcoming bid opportunities, and small business events and workshops. It is also available on smud.org. The open rate, click rate and click-to-open rate for the external SEED recipients was higher than all SMUD emails on average, with an open rate of 50.53 percent, click rate of 10.88% and click-to-open rate of 21.53%. The SEED team will relaunch the SEED newsletter in an updated format for 2024.

The purpose is to provide the Board with the annual update on SD-14, System Enhancement, for the year 2023. The information in the monitoring report could be used by the Board to determine if the policy needs to be revised or further developed. If so, those items could be scheduled for subsequent meetings.  

**Board Policy:**  
Strategic Direction SD-14, System Enhancement.  

**Benefits:**  
Allows the Board of Directors a better understanding of Board Policies and gives them an opportunity to make revisions if necessary.  

**Cost/Budgeted:**  
In June 2020, the Board approved suspension of funding new projects under SD-14 for 2020, 2021 and 2022 (Resolution 20-06-23). Previously committed projects, a total of three, under the Policy would continue to be funded during these years. The total 2023 budget for these three projects was $2.6 million and the actual spending was approximately $99,000. The large variance between plan and actuals is due to local agency schedule adjustments.  

**Alternatives:**  
Provide the Board written reports and communications through the CEO & General Manager.  

**Affected Parties:**

Board Monitoring Report; SD-14: System Enhancement  

Internal Audit Services (IAS) received the SD-14 System Enhancement 2023 Annual Board Monitoring Report and performed the following:

- Selected a sample of statements and assertions in the report for review.
- Interviewed report contributors and verified the methodology used to prepare the statements in our sample.
- Validated the reasonableness of the statements in our sample based on the data or other support provided to us.

# Board Monitoring Report 2023
## Strategic Direction
### SD-14, System Enhancement

1. **Background**

   Strategic Direction SD-14, the System Enhancement Board policy states that:

   As a community-owned utility, SMUD recognizes that the relocation or underground placement of primary voltage power lines may be desirable to local jurisdictions to improve aesthetics, economic vitality, safety and disabled access. Therefore, it is a key value of SMUD to make selected distribution system enhancements, such as permanent relocation or underground placement of primary power lines below 69 kV.

   a) SMUD will, at its expense and where technically feasible, permanently relocate or underground existing overhead distribution facilities provided the governing body of the city or county in which the electric facilities are and will be located has:

   i) Identified, after consultation with SMUD, a specific system enhancement project;

   ii) Determined the project is in the public interest;

   iii) Ensured all existing overhead communication facilities related to the project will also be permanently relocated or placed underground;

   iv) Obtained and provided SMUD with all easements necessary for the project.

   b) After achievement of core financial targets, SMUD will annually commit up to one-half of one percent of its annual gross electric sales revenue to system enhancements. The proposed projects will be subject to SMUD’s annual budget approval process, and uncommitted funds from any given year will not be carried over to future years. Funding will be assigned to projects brought forward by local cities or counties based on applying the following criteria (not in order of preference):

   i) Project scale and/or cost when measured against available SMUD resources.

   ii) Requesting entity has developed full scope, obtained all necessary easements, and development plan for customer service conversion from overhead to underground, as required.

   iii) Extent to which the costs are borne by others.

![Executive Summary](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=2.+Executive+summary)

**2. Executive summary**

The policy states that SMUD “will annually commit up to one-half of one percent of its annual gross electric sales revenue to system enhancements.” For 2023, this threshold was approximately $8.35 million.

SMUD is in compliance with SD-14, System Enhancement.

The planning and execution of SD-14 projects is typically a multi-year process that starts with a preliminary work scope that is used to determine a ballpark cost estimate, to the finalization of the work scope that includes a detailed design and detailed cost estimate. After necessary permits and easements are obtained, the project is released for execution/construction. Table 1 below shows the committed projects and their design and construction schedules. The budget for these three multi-year projects were included in the approved operational plans and budgets. Two of the three projects were planned for 2022, but schedule changes driven by the local agencies moved the project design and construction to future years.

**Table 1: Committed Projects in Progress**

| Local Jurisdiction | Project Title | Total Cost Estimate | 2023 Project Budget | 2023 Project Spend | Project Status |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Sacramento County   | Greenback Lane Road Improvements (0.8 miles) | $1,000K | $0K | $18K | Design in 2024; Construction in 2026 |
| City of Citrus Heights | Auburn Blvd. Rusch Park to I-80 (0.75 miles) | $2,900K | $2,670K (a) | $49K | Design in 2023; Construction in 2025 |
| City of Elk Grove   | Elk Grove Blvd. Waterman to School St. (0.5 miles) | $1,500K | $7K (a) | $32K | Design in 2023; Construction in 2025 |

(a) The original schedule called for the project construction to start in 2022 but the local agency deferred construction to later years.
