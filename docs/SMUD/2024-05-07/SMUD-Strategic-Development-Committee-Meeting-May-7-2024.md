While the gross load peak on a typical day occurs in the late afternoon, the early evening net load peak is becoming increasingly critical during hot weather, as solar production ends and demand remains high.

# Key Takeaways

- California is increasingly powering its economy with clean energy resources BUT we face challenges with scaling up clean energy resources, while retiring fossil fueled resources and maintaining grid reliability during climate induced extreme events.

- However, California has new investments, tools and mechanisms in place that is enabling a comprehensive, focused and multi-pronged electric supply and demand approach to ensure grid reliability during peak-demand summer months.

- We need to SUSTAIN our existing efforts, while considering new policy and investment approaches, constructs and options that place the state in a position to proactively address our challenges now and going forward.
