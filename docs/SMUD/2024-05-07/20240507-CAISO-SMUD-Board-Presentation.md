# Summer 2023 Review

## Overview
- California load conditions were moderate while hydro conditions reflected record snowpack in California
- Southwest experienced record-breaking load conditions
- Northwest above normal load and at or below normal hydro conditions
- New forms and levels of uncertainty were experienced

## Role the WEIM had on reliability
- High west-wide regional demand created export out of California patterns never experienced
- WEIM demonstrated the power of being able to redirect energy from where it was available to where it was needed with the hour

## Growth of storage
- Over 3,000 MW of storage added to the system approaching 6,000 MW

![Forecast summer conditions in 2024 continue to improve over previous summers](https://www.caiso.com/Pages/default.aspx)

- Additional new capacity of 8,384 MW online or expected by June 30, since last August
  - Primarily solar and storage
  - Equals 4,919 MW of “net qualifying capacity”
  
- Average or moderately above average hydro conditions

- Softening of near-term load forecasts by CEC, and shift of peak load a few hours earlier in the day

- These gains more than offset generation retirements and transition of remaining OTC generation to strategic reserves.
  - Strategic reserves not included in this analysis
  - 2,895 MW of OTC converted to strategic reserve / 841 MW Retired

![Slide](https://www.caliso.com/public/images/slide6.png)

These gains are demonstrated in both metrics the ISO is using to assess summer preparedness

- The calculated loss-of-load expectation exceeds the target 1-in-10 level
  - A margin of approximately 2,700 MW was found above the minimum needed to achieve target
  - Note the LOLE expectation relates to the probability of calling on emergency measures, not actual load shed

- The “stack analysis” capacity analysis found a surplus of at least 3,500 MW above a target 18.5% reserve margin across net peak load hours
  - The target 18.5% reserve margin is an ISO-derived measure assessing ability to maintain operating reserve margins in reasonably stressed conditions – does not ensure a 1-in-10 LOLE target will be achieved

![California Energy Commission Forecast](https://www.caiso.com/Pages/default.aspx)

### California Energy Commission Forecast
- **Lower near-term growth in consumption (CAISO Planning Forecast)**
  - Higher electric rate forecasts, lower Dept of Finance projections for population and households
- **Increased Behind-the-Meter solar PV adoption**
  - Lower system costs, higher electric rates lead to reduced payback period
- **Refreshed base consumption profile**
  - Leveraged more recent load and solar PV generation data
  - Peak hour occurs earlier in the day when solar PV has a greater peak-reduction effect. This is aligned with recent observed system peak hours
  - Lower system-wide coincidence peak
- **2024 Resource adequacy requirements were based on 2022 California Energy Demand (CED) forecast.**

#### Peak monthly forecasts for 2024 (annual peak highlighted in yellow):
| Month | 2022 IEPR | 2023 IEPR | Delta | % change |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|----------|
| 6     | 42,791    | 41,902    | (889) | -2.1%    |
| 7     | 45,938    | 46,244    | 306   | 0.7%     |
| 8     | 46,569    | 45,059    | (1,510)| -3.2%    |
| 9     | 47,475    | 45,972    | (1,503)| -3.2%    |

![Seasonal Temperature Outlook](https://www.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/featured_image/public/2024-04-18-Seasonal-Temperature-Outlook.png?itok=8g1g1g1g)

**Weather forecast guidance shows an increased chance of heat waves across interior CA and high likelihood of above normal temperatures**

- **June - August 2024:**
  - Above normal temperatures are most likely to occur across the Desert Southwest, and
  - A lower chance of above normal temperatures in coastal locations especially Southern California.

- **August and September 2024:**
  - Increased chance of heat events across interior California.

- Additional new capacity, average or moderately above average hydro conditions and softening of near term load forecasts by CEC more than offset generation retirements and transition of remaining OTC generation to strategic reserves.
- These result in both static and probabilistic ISO metrics being met with a reasonable margin
  - The loss of load expectation target of 1-in-10 is forecast to be met with a margin of approximately 2550 MW
- Strategic reserves continue to be a critical tool for reliability
  - While installed capacity is sufficient, some capacity may be contracted externally and not by California LSE
  - Extreme drought, wildfires and continued potential for widespread heating events and other disruptions continue to pose a high risk for outages to the ISO grid

- Showed measurable benefits of regional cooperation are production cost savings, capacity savings, emissions reductions and enhanced reliability.

**Letter from Western Commissioners (2023)** – Recognizes western coordination, including the opportunity for unified Western market and full range of western integration services, provides the greatest benefits for consumers.
- Recommends stakeholders gather and decide key elements of how an independent entity would be formed and structured.
