# What is SMUD’s Market Footprint?

## Bi-Lateral Market
SMUD participates in energy markets in the Western Interconnect - from the Rocky Mountains west including parts of Canada and Mexico. Transactions from next hour to years’ long complex Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).

## CAISO Energy Imbalance Market (EIM)
The EIM’s advanced market system automatically finds low-cost energy to serve real-time consumer demand across the west. Since its launch in 2014, the EIM has enhanced grid reliability and generated cost savings for its participants. Besides its economic advantages, the EIM improves the integration of renewable energy, which leads to a cleaner, greener grid.

The EIM serves as SMUD’s primary Realtime Energy Market. SMUD went live in April of 2019 with the remainder of Balancing Authority of Northern California (BANC) joining in March of 2021.

# 2023 Summer Recap

- Few extreme operating days compared to recent years.
- SMUD Peak Load was 3,059 MWs on August 16, 2023.
- Generation fleet and transmission system healthy. No significant forced outages during the summer period.
- British Columbia had a below normal water year (2022-23) which kept Pacific Northwest (PNW) prices strong going into and during summer period.
- Above average precipitation led to an abundant snowpack in the Upper American River Project (UARP) watershed producing 2,375 GWhs vs budget of 1,598 GWhs of energy for SMUD's system, approximately 23.5% of retail sales.

# Market Outlook Summer 2024

- **BANC/SMUD Summer Readiness – Cautiously Optimistic**
- **RA Market pricing continues to be elevated, but easing**
  - September 2024 RA broker quote @ $77.50 KW/month
- **Market uncertainty reflected in elevated energy prices, but easing**
  - Northwest Heavy Load for July 2024 currently @ $135.94 (July 2023 @ $147.00)
  - Northwest Heavy Load for August 2024 currently @ $199.75 (Aug 2023 @ $235.00)
  - Natural Gas prices are lower for 2024 easing some pressure on power prices (July 2024 $3.32, July 2023 $5.87)
- **Required Actions**
  - Procure 30MWs for July, all other months compliant. Will utilize financial hedges to address forward looking energy imbalances to provide price protection.

# Market Outlook Summer 2024 (cont.)

There are three important regions to consider for hydrological conditions:
- Upper American River Project (UARP) – SMUD-owned hydro generation
- Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) Central Valley Project (CVP) – hydro generation contracted with WAPA from across California
- Pacific Northwest (PNW) - hydro generation in Oregon, Washington and British Columbia

| Area (as of 4/11/2024) | Precipitation as snowpack (% of normal) | Precipitation as rain (% of normal) |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| UARP                   | 136                                     | 90                                  |
| CVP                    | 132                                     | 101                                 |
| PNW                    | 87                                      | 94                                  |

Though the year started slowly for California snowpack, several storms brought Snow Water Equivalent and Precipitation close to 100% of average. The Pacific Northwest struggled this year, coming just short of average.
