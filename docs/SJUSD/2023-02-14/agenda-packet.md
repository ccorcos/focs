### AGENDA ITEM: G-6  
### MEETING DATE: 02/14/2023  

**SUBJECT:** Early Head Start (EHS)/Head Start (HS) Year 2 Budget Modification/Carryover Funds  
**DEPARTMENT:** Early Childhood Education (ECE)

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the Early Head Start and Head Start Year 2 Budget Modifications/Carryover Funds.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The purpose of this item is to get approval of the Early Head Start and Head Start budget modifications and Year 2 carryover funds for both programs serving San Juan Unified School District’s (SJUSD) earliest learners. Each year the SJUSD’S Early Childhood Education department is awarded federal grant funds to support both Early Head Start and Head Start programs. The purpose of ECE requesting to use these funds is to be able to fund projects to improve the safety of all facilities in need of repairs (rust, rotted wood, storage sheds, outdoor improvements, security gates, cracked cement, shade and playground structures). ECE would also like to use these carry over funds to provide materials in the classroom to support the social emotional needs of all students in both programs.  

The Office of Head Start has now approved the carryover of unspent funds from prior years. Our carryover request was required by the Office of Head Start to be requested after the Year 1 carryover was approved at the board meeting on January 24, 2023. We are now asking for approval to carry over funds from the 2021-2022 school year. You will see in the attached documents the fiscal impact on the Early Childhood Education Department and the amounts that will be carried over.

# Use of School Facilities and Grounds

Thank you for your interest in using San Juan Unified School District (“SJUSD”) facilities and grounds. SJUSD works with hundreds of community organizations to make available school buildings/grounds for public, literary, scientific, recreational, or educational meetings, or for the discussion of matters of general or public interest.

The handbook is designed to help users of SJUSD facilities and grounds to determine if their event/program qualifies to use school facilities or grounds, how to submit a Facilities or Grounds Use application permit request, an overview of the fee structure, review of the insurance requirements and other important information. We encourage you to read the entire handbook before submitting your application permit request.

We hope you find this information helpful in processing your application permit request. If you have any suggestions for improvement, please email us at CivicPermitsFacilitiesUse@sanjuan.edu.

This facilities and grounds handbook follows the applicable law as defined in the California Education Code sections 10900 through 10914.5 and sections 38130 through 38138, referred to as the “Civic Center Act”.

## Types of Facility and Grounds Use

School facilities and grounds, subject to SJUSD policies and regulations, may be made available to citizens and community groups as a civic center for the following purposes (Education Code § 38131):

1. Public, literary, scientific, recreational, educational or public agency meetings.
2. The discussion of matters of general or public interest.
3. The conduct of religious services for temporary periods, on a one-time basis or renewal basis, by any church or religious organization.
4. Child care programs to provide supervision and activities for children of preschool and elementary school age.
5. The administration of examinations for the selection of personnel or the instruction of precinct board members by public agencies.
6. Supervised recreational activities including, but not limited to, sports league activities that are arranged for and supervised by entities, including religious organizations or churches, and in which youths may participate regardless of religious belief or denomination.
7. A community youth center.
8. A ceremony, patriotic celebration, or related educational assembly conducted by a veterans’ organization.
9. Other purposes deemed appropriate by the governing board.
10. State laws prohibit the use of school facilities and grounds for subversive, immoral, offensive, or harmful purposes. State laws also limit the use of the school facilities and grounds for denominational or sectarian activities. The use of the school facilities and grounds shall not be granted to persons, forums, corporations, groups, clubs, or associations which:
   (a) May, by use, be reasonably expected to expose the property of SJUSD to damage through riot, mob action, or violence of any kind.
   (b) Use the property in a manner which will be adverse to the best interest of SJUSD.
   (c) Use of facilities and grounds for a purpose not consistent with the Civic Center Act and/or adopted Board Policies.
11. Groups or persons using school facilities and grounds under the provisions of this policy shall be liable for any property damages caused by the activity. The Board shall charge the amount necessary to repair the damages and may deny the group further use of the school facilities and grounds (Education Code § 38134).

### AGENDA ITEM: I-1  
### MEETING DATE: 02/14/2023  

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: Camp Winthers Fee Increase  
**DEPARTMENT:** Division of Teaching and Learning  

---

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board hear an update and hold a public hearing related to an increase in the fees for Camp Winthers summer camp programs and fall, weekend group usage.  

**Action Anticipated:** 02/28/2023  

---

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Environmental education programs have been conducted at Camp Winthers since 1957 and is owned and operated by the San Juan Unified School District. The fees and rates for the Camp Winthers summer program and the fall/weekend camp rental components have been static for more than a decade. Meanwhile, operating costs have continued to rise. Camp Winthers fees are significantly lower than comparable programs in the region. This is a feature that has kept the program accessible to families who otherwise would not be able to afford summer camp. However, the current revenue structure is running at a deficit. The recommendation is to incrementally increase fees over the next few years to help cover the actual operating cost of the summer camp program.

### Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)
- Slide 8
  - **GRANTS**: Every student generates a base grant, which covers basic educational costs, including salaries, materials, etc.
  - **SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS**: Every student who is homeless, learning disabled, or an English learner generates 20% more funding above the base grant. These funds must be spent on improving the educational outcomes for those specific groups in order to improve their achievement.
  - **CONCENTRATION GRANTS**: Districts where at least 55% of students are in the above categories receive additional funding. These funds must be spent to increase or improve services for those students in order to improve their achievement.

![Attachment B: 2022 California School Dashboard Results](https://www.caschooldashboard.org/)

**Changes to the Dashboard**  
The California School Dashboard reports how districts and schools are performing on multiple state and local measures that make up California’s accountability system. In prior years, the Dashboard reported performance levels using colors: blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. These performance levels were determined using two years of data and reported the difference between current year performance (“status”) and prior year performance to show growth or decline (“change”) over time. Because the pandemic interrupted the statewide data collection, assessment, and accountability systems, the 2022 Dashboard is a restart of California’s accountability system and only reports current year performance using one of five purple levels. The multicolored Dashboard that reports change in performance will return in 2023.

**Prior Years: “Change” – Difference between current year performance and prior year performance**  
- RED: LOWEST PERFORMANCE  
- ORANGE  
- YELLOW  
- GREEN  
- BLUE: HIGHEST PERFORMANCE  

**2022 Dashboard: “Status” – Current year performance**  
- VERY LOW  
- LOW  
- MEDIUM  
- HIGH  
- VERY HIGH  

**Participation Rate Penalty**  
In 2021-22, a new penalty went into place for districts and schools not meeting a 95 percent participation rate on the CAASPP ELA and math. If a district, school, or student group did not meet the 95 percent participation rate requirement on the CAASPP, a penalty was applied to the academic indicator on the CA School Dashboard. In comparison to the penalty that was applied in previous years, this new penalty calculation has resulted in lower performance levels in ELA and math than in prior years.

**Statewide Indicators**  
The sections below provide a description and the results of each Dashboard indicator by student group, year, and status. The CDE is advising that 2022 data be viewed as a new baseline and not be compared to previous year data because of the pandemic’s impact on teaching, learning, and testing. Please note, that 2019 data has been included below not as a comparison for improvement, but rather for context to understand the impact the pandemic had on teaching, learning, and testing for our student groups. Additional information can be found at [https://www.caschooldashboard.org/](https://www.caschooldashboard.org/).

![Academic Performance](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Academic+Performance)

Academic Performance  
Academic Performance contains two measures: ELA and mathematics. They are based on student performance on the CAASPP, which are taken each spring by students in grades three through eight and grade eleven. These indicators show the number of points above or below students are from meeting grade-level standards.

# College/Career Readiness
The College/Career Readiness (CCR) Indicator shows the percentage of students who graduate from high school better prepared for college or a career. It uses many different measures of college and career preparedness, such as completion of coursework and work experience to exam results.

**Note:** The CCR Indicator is not reported on the 2022 Dashboard due to the impact of COVID-19 on the administration of the 2020-21 statewide summative assessments. Reporting of this measure will resume in 2023.

![Successes](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1018.png?text=Successes)

- Choices seamlessly transitioned to distance learning during the COVID-19 campus closure, and extremely strong 2021 English and Math SBA scores reflect this.
- No significant learning loss in English Language Arts occurred following the pandemic, as is demonstrated by strong 2022 English SBA scores that exceed state averages.
- Choices reaches all students in an equitable manner, as is seen by SBA scores: disadvantaged student subgroups either outperform All Students or lag behind them by fewer points than across the state.
- Choices offers a safe and caring learning environment; 100% of returning students in 2021 and 2022 reported feeling safe on campus during the previous year.
- While many Choices students cite anxiety as a primary reason for enrolling, roughly half of them later state that they feel less anxiety since they started to attend.
<!-- Page 154 -->
![Challenges/Areas of Growth](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1018.png?text=Challenges/Areas+of+Growth)

**Challenges/Areas of Growth**

The following Choices data points lag behind state averages; Choices is aware of these areas of need and is focused on growth through targeted action:

- **Graduation Rate and College Career Indicator**
  - Choices is actively promoting, through its WASC Graduation Outcomes, the accomplishment of individual goals through college and career planning and timely graduation. This process involves various practices, activities, and academic assignments that raise awareness, require reflection, and promote practical decision-making that builds a path toward the accomplishment of long-term objectives.

- **Math SBA Scores**
  - Two new dedicated Math teachers meet students where they are and assist them, with innovative practices and the support of a full-time tutor, to build skills while completing homework assignments.

LCAP funds will continue to target these areas of need where Choices expects to continue to experience incremental growth.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## BOARD OF EDUCATION  
### AGENDA ITEM: I-5  
### MEETING DATE: 02/14/2023  

**SUBJECT:** Resolution Reducing or Discontinuing Particular Kinds of Services—TK-12 Certificated  
**DEPARTMENT:** Human Resources  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board discuss the adoption of:  
1. Resolution No. 4066, reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services, and the corresponding amount of certificated staffing that will be reduced as a result (attachment 1).  
2. Resolution No. 4067, establishing criteria to apply to break a tie in seniority for certificated staff affected by program reductions and who have the same date of hire (attachment 2).  

**Action anticipated:** 02/28/2023  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Each year through a comprehensive student needs assessment, all school sites participate in a process to align student needs to site allocations. As the needs and resources (and often enrollment) change, staffing also changes. At the local level, each school site engages staff, students, parents, and educational partners in various ways to determine the most beneficial actions. Through the needs assessment process, the site determines what positions need to be eliminated, retained, or shifted. The elimination of (or planned elimination of) particular kinds of service (PKS) determines the PKS list.  

The district is committed to building a sustainable budget that aligns resources with the Strategic Plan and Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP). This is addressed through the collective work of our entire community and the district is fortunate to have families, local leaders and employees who recognize and value the importance of public education. Instructional leaders are continually evaluating allocation of resources and program delivery models. To best meet the needs of San Juan Unified School District students, changes to the delivery model for certain services have been recommended for the 2023-24 school year.  

As a result of the need to make changes, certain kinds of services rendered by certificated employees have been identified to be eliminated or reduced. In order to meet statutory notice requirements for potential reassignments or layoffs, the board needs to adopt the two resolutions specified above.  

**ATTACHMENT(S):**  
1. Resolution No. 4066, reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services.  
2. Resolution No. 4067, establishing criteria to apply to break a tie in seniority for certificated staff affected by program reductions and who have the same date of hire.
