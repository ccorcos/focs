### AGENDA ITEM: G-6
### MEETING DATE: 02/13/2024

**SUBJECT:** Proposed Name Change for Arcade Fundamental Middle School  
**DEPARTMENT:** Division of Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the request to change the name of Arcade Fundamental Middle School to Arcade Middle School.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
As Arcade Fundamental Middle School looks forward to the debut of its modernized campus in the fall of 2024, the community explored potentially removing “Fundamental” from the school’s name.

WHEREAS, the District has adopted the uniform public construction cost accounting procedures set forth in the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act set forth at California Public Contact Code Section 22000 et seq.

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Act, if a public entity adopts the uniform public construction cost accounting procedures, per Public Contract Code Section 22050 in the case of an emergency, when any repairs, alterations, work, or improvement is necessary to any facility of public schools to permit the continuance of existing school classes, or to avoid danger to life or property; such public agency may, in its discretion, delegate to an administrative officer of such public agency the authority to repair or replace a public facility, take any directly related and immediate action required by such emergency, and procure any necessary equipment, services, and supplies for those purposes, without giving notice for bids to let contracts and without prior notice or approval of the governing board of such public agency.

If a person with such authority orders any action specified under this resolution; that person shall report to the governing board, at its next meeting the reasons justifying why the emergency would not permit a delay resulting from a competitive solicitation for bids and why the action was necessary to respond to the emergency. The board shall review the emergency action at every regularly scheduled meeting thereafter until the action is terminated. The action shall be terminated at the earliest possible date that conditions warrant so that the remainder of the emergency action may be completed by giving notice for bids to let contracts.

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the governing board of the San Juan Unified School District hereby delegates to the undersigned the authority in case of an emergency to repair or replace a public facility, take any directly related and immediate action required by such emergency, and procure any necessary equipment, services, and supplies for those purposes, without giving notice for bids to let contracts and without prior notice or approval of the governing board of such public agency.

### AGENDA ITEM: G-11
### MEETING DATE: 02/13/2024

**SUBJECT:** CEQA Notice of Exemption for the Arlington Heights Elementary School Site Security Project

**DEPARTMENT:** Facilities

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Notice of Exemption for the Arlington Heights Elementary School Site Security Project.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Arlington Heights Elementary School’s campus at 6401 Trenton Way (APN: 229-0172-001), in Citrus Heights, California. The project area spans approximately 590 feet of paved, landscaped, and recreational areas within the school’s boundaries. The project scope includes the construction of site fencing and gates along the school frontage primarily at the center of campus. The project will also include the construction and installation of an electronic gate, multiple pedestrian gates, and maintenance gates. As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

Arlington Heights Elementary School Site Security Project  
CEQA Categorical Exemption  
Terracon Project No: NB237389  

---

**Project Information:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Arlington Heights Elementary School’s campus at 6401 Trenton Way (APN: 229-0172-001), in Citrus Heights, California. The project area spans approximately 590 feet of paved, landscaped, and recreational areas within the school’s boundaries (Exhibit 1). The project scope includes the construction of site fencing and gates along the school frontage primarily at the center of campus. The project will also include the construction and installation of an electronic gate, multiple pedestrian gates, and maintenance gates.

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

---

**Legal Setting:**  
**Categorical Exemptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300)**  
Projects that are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact may be Categorically Exempt from CEQA review. As described in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300, Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires these guidelines to include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. In response to that mandate, the Secretary for Resources has found that the following classes of projects listed in this article do not have a significant effect on the environment, and they are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.

Like many school-maintenance projects (that do not involve additional classrooms or student capacity), the proposed project is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts under CEQA.

![Table 1. Abbreviated CEQA Environmental Checklist](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Table+1.+Abbreviated+CEQA+Environmental+Checklist)

| Impact Category                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aesthetics                    | The project would not result in impacts related to scenic vistas, state-listed scenic highways. Any new lighting associated with the proposed project would be consistent with previous conditions and would not result in an impact on Aesthetics. |
| Agriculture and Forestry Resources | The proposed project would not involve agricultural lands or Prime Farmland.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Air Quality                   | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of pollutants or odors to sensitive receptors. Although Sacramento County is in nonattainment status for PM-2.5 (2006) and 8-Hour Ozone (2015) criteria pollutants, the proposed project would not result in a significant net increase of such pollutants, nor would the project conflict with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)'s ability to comply with any applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP). |
| Biological Resources          | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect an HCP, NCCP, or other sensitive biological resources. The school campus is not expected to contain Elderberry (Sambucus sp.); however, if any are required to be removed, a pre-construction survey would be necessary to ensure Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle habitat is not present. Additional project commitments include a pre-construction nesting bird survey or limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting period to avoid non-compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If active nests are to be found during a nesting bird survey, no-work buffer areas would be established in consultation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). |
| Cultural Resources            | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not suspected to contain archeological artifacts. In the event that archeological or cultural resources are discovered onsite, work would cease immediately until consultation and approval to continue work was provided by a qualified archeologist. |
| Energy                        | The proposed project would not result in an impact related to the wasteful or inefficient use of energy.                                                                                                                                                     |

**Geology and Soils**  
The proposed project would not result in geological impacts. The project construction would take place on existing pavement and would not result in new construction in unsafe soils.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
Although greenhouse gases would be emitted during project construction, it would not result in a significant impact on the environment, nor would it conflict with a plan, policy, or regulation aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

**Hazards and Hazardous Materials**  
The proposed project would not involve the use or release of potentially hazardous substances. Abatement of Hazardous Materials Plan (AHMP) will be created prior to project construction to handle potential unexpected encounters with hazardous materials.

**Hydrology and Water Quality**  
Local water quality impacts would be avoided by the usage of routing stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) during construction and material staging activities.

**Land Use and Planning**  
The proposed project would not divide an established community, nor would it result in a conflict with a land use plan or zoning ordinance.

**Mineral Resources**  
The proposed project would not involve Mineral Resources.

**Noise**  
The proposed project would not result in the exposure of excessive noise levels. Construction would not take place during the school year. Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts.

**Population and Housing**  
The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth.

**Public Services**  
The proposed project would not negatively affect public services, but instead would improve the school’s ability to provide security for their students.

**Recreation**  
The proposed project would not lead to the deterioration of existing recreational facilities, nor would it involve the construction of new facilities that would result in an adverse physical environmental consequence.

**Transportation**  
The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation, because construction would occur outside of the school year when student traffic patterns would not be affected by the work.

**Tribal Cultural Resources**  
The proposed project would not have the capability to impact a listed or eligible resource.

**Wildfire**  
The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards.

**Mandatory Findings of Significance**  
The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact.

---

**Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)**  
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located – a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified Environmental Impact Report (EIR).

(e) **Hazardous Waste Sites.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) **Historical Resources.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

---

**Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314)**  
Class 14 projects are described in § 15314 as "minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less." The project would take place entirely within Arlington Heights Elementary School's existing property and would not involve the addition of any new classrooms, nor would it affect the school's student capacity. The proposed project fits the description provided in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314.

The project will also include the construction and installation of an electronic gate, multiple pedestrian gates, and maintenance gates.

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

**Legal Setting:**  
Categorical Exemptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300)  
Projects that are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact may be Categorically Exempt from CEQA review. As described in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300, Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires these guidelines to include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. In response to that mandate, the Secretary for Resources has found that the following classes of projects listed in this article do not have a significant effect on the environment, and they are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.

Like many school-maintenance projects (that do not involve additional classrooms or student capacity), the proposed project is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts under CEQA.

|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aesthetics                    | The project would not result in impacts related to scenic vistas, state-listed scenic highways. Any new lighting associated with the proposed project would be consistent with previous conditions and would not result in an impact on Aesthetics.                                                                                       |
| Agriculture and Forestry Resources | The proposed project would not involve agricultural lands or Prime Farmland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Air Quality                   | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of pollutants or odors to sensitive receptors. Although Sacramento County is in nonattainment status for PM-2.5 (2006) and 8-Hour Ozone (2015) criteria pollutants, the proposed project would not result in a significant net increase of such pollutants, nor would the project conflict with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management Plan (SMAQMD)'s ability to comply with any applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP). |
| Biological Resources          | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect an HCP, NCCP, or other sensitive biological resources. The school campus is not expected to contain Elderberry (Sambucus sp.); however, if any are required to be removed, a pre-construction survey would be necessary to ensure Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle habitat is not present. Additional project commitments include a pre-construction nesting bird survey or limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting period to avoid non-compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If active nests are to be found during a nesting bird survey, no-work buffer areas would be established in consultation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). |
| Cultural Resources            | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not suspected to contain archeological artifacts. In the event that archeological or cultural resources are discovered onsite, work would cease immediately until consultation and approval to continue work was provided by a qualified archeologist.                                                                 |
| Energy                        | The proposed project would not result in an impact related to the wasteful or inefficient use of energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

![Terracon Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Terracon+Document)

**Geology and Soils**  
The proposed project would not result in geological impacts. The project construction would take place on existing pavement and would not result in new construction in unsafe soils.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
Although greenhouse gases would be emitted during project construction, it would not result in a significant impact on the environment, nor would it conflict with a plan, policy, or regulation aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

**Hazards and Hazardous Materials**  
The proposed project would not involve the use or release of potentially hazardous substances. Abatement of Hazardous Materials Plan (AHMP) will be created prior to project construction to handle potential unexpected encounters with hazardous materials.

**Hydrology and Water Quality**  
Local water quality impacts would be avoided by the usage of routing stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) during construction and material staging activities.

**Land Use and Planning**  
The proposed project would not divide an established community, nor would it result in a conflict with a land use plan or zoning ordinance.

**Mineral Resources**  
The proposed project would not involve Mineral Resources.

**Noise**  
The proposed project would not result in the exposure of excessive noise levels. Construction would not take place during the school year. Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts.

**Population and Housing**  
The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth.

**Public Services**  
The proposed project would not negatively affect public services, but instead would improve the school’s ability to provide security for their students.

**Recreation**  
The proposed project would not lead to the deterioration of existing recreational facilities, nor would it involve the construction of new facilities that would result in an adverse physical environmental consequence.

![Terracon Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Terracon+Document)

**Transportation**  
The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation, because construction would occur outside of the school year when student traffic patterns would not be affected by the work.

**Tribal Cultural Resources**  
The proposed project would not have the capability to impact a listed or eligible resource.

**Wildfire**  
The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards.

**Mandatory Findings of Significance**  
The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact.

---

**Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)**  
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located – a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified Environmental Impact Report (EIR).

(e) **Hazardous Waste Sites.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) **Historical Resources.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

**Summary:**
The proposed project would not result in any significant impacts to the environment (please see Table 1). The activities that make up the proposed project (installation of fences and gates, vegetation removal, landscaping, installation of safety lights and cameras, etc.) meet both the description of a Class 14-exempt project as well as the criteria listed in the Exceptions to CEQA Categorical Exemptions. The project area is not located on a hazard waste site or other environmental feature of critical concern. The proposed project would not result in a significant impact, nor would it result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant cumulative impact.

The long-term effects of the project are likely to be beneficial for the safety of the school and community. The project site is not in the vicinity of a Scenic Highway, and the project would not be expected to impact historical resources. No historic properties are known to exist in the project area; if artifacts were to be found during construction, work would stop immediately, and a qualified archeologist would be consulted with before work were to resume.

Avoidance and minimization measures would be incorporated to avoid impacts to biological resources. Such measures include limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting season (Feb 1 through Aug 31). Alternatively, if vegetation removal was needed during the nesting period, a nesting bird survey would be required. If nesting or migratory birds were found, the San Joaquin Unified School District would be responsible for establishing no-work buffers, as necessary, with the input of CDFW, before the commencement of construction or tree removal activities.

Considering the data summarized in this memorandum, it is Terracon’s opinion that the Del Campo High School Site Security Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA documentation.

Like many school-maintenance projects (that do not involve additional classrooms or student capacity), the proposed project is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts under CEQA. Table 1 provides an abbreviated CEQA checklist, explaining why the implementation of the proposed project would not result in any significant environmental impacts.

**Geology and Soils**  
The proposed project would not result in geological impacts. The project construction would take place on existing pavement and would not result in new construction in unsafe soils.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
Although greenhouse gases would be emitted during project construction, it would not result in a significant impact on the environment, nor would it conflict with a plan, policy, or regulation aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

**Hazards and Hazardous Materials**  
The proposed project would not involve the use or release of potentially hazardous substances. Abatement of Hazardous Materials Plan (AHMP) will be created prior to project construction to handle potential unexpected encounters with hazardous materials.

**Hydrology and Water Quality**  
Local water quality impacts would be avoided by the usage of routing stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) during construction and material staging activities.

**Land Use and Planning**  
The proposed project would not divide an established community, nor would it result in a conflict with a land use plan or zoning ordinance.

**Mineral Resources**  
The proposed project would not involve Mineral Resources.

**Noise**  
The proposed project would not result in the exposure of excessive noise levels. Construction would not take place during the school year. Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts.

**Population and Housing**  
The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth.

**Public Services**  
The proposed project would not negatively affect public services, but instead would improve the high school’s ability to provide security for their students.

The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation, because construction would occur outside of the school year when student traffic patterns would not be affected by the work.

**Tribal Cultural Resources**  
The proposed project would not have the capability to impact a listed or eligible resource.

**Wildfire**  
The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards.

**Mandatory Findings of Significance**  
The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact.

---

**Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)**  
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located - a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified Environmental Impact Report (EIR).

(e) **Hazardous Waste Sites.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) **Historical Resources.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

<!-- Page 71 -->
![Class 14 projects are described in § 15314 as "minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less." The project would take place entirely within Howe Avenue Elementary School's existing property and would not involve the addition of any new classrooms, nor would it affect the school's student capacity. The proposed project fits the description provided in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314.](https://example.com/image)

**Summary:**
The proposed project would not result in any significant impacts to the environment (please see Table 1). The activities that make up the proposed project (installation of fences and gates, vegetation removal, landscaping, installation of safety lights and cameras, etc.) meet both the description of a Class 14 exempt project as well as the criteria listed in the Exceptions to CEQA Categorical Exemptions. The project area is not located on a hazard waste site or other environmental feature of critical concern. The proposed project would not result in a significant impact, nor would it result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant cumulative impact.

The long-term effects of the project are likely to be beneficial for the safety of the school and community. The project site is not in the vicinity of a Scenic Highway, and the project would not be expected to impact historical resources. No historic properties are known to exist in the project area; if artifacts were to be found during construction, work would stop immediately, and a qualified archeologist would be consulted with before work were to resume.

Avoidance and minimization measures would be incorporated to avoid impacts to biological resources. Such measures include limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting season (Feb 1 through Aug 31). Alternatively, if vegetation removal was needed during the nesting period, a nesting bird survey would be required. If nesting or migratory birds were found, the San Joaquin Unified School District would be responsible for establishing no-work buffers, as necessary, with the input of CDFW, before the commencement of construction or tree removal activities.

Considering the data summarized in this memorandum, it is Terracon’s opinion that the Howe Avenue Elementary School Site Security Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA documentation.

**Project Information:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Kingswood K-8 School’s campus at 5700 Primrose Drive (APN: 233-0680-001), in Citrus Heights, California. The project area spans approximately 475 feet of paved, landscaped, and recreational areas within the school’s boundaries (Exhibit 1). The project scope includes the construction of site fencing and gates along the school frontage towards the southwestern campus boundary. The project will also include the construction and installation of an electronic gate, multiple pedestrian gates, and maintenance gates.

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

**Legal Setting:**  
Categorical Exemptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300)  
Projects that are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact may be Categorically Exempt from CEQA review. As described in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300, Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires these guidelines to include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. In response to that mandate, the Secretary for Resources has found that the following classes of projects listed in this article do not have a significant effect on the environment, and they are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.

Like many school-maintenance projects (that do not involve additional classrooms or student capacity), the proposed project is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts under CEQA.

Table 1 provides an abbreviated CEQA checklist, explaining why the implementation of the proposed project would not result in any significant environmental impacts.

### Table 1. Abbreviated CEQA Environmental Checklist

| Impact Category                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aesthetics                     | The project would not result in impacts related to scenic vistas, state-listed scenic highways. Any new lighting associated with the proposed project would be consistent with previous conditions and would not result in an impact on Aesthetics.                                                                                                         |
| Agriculture and Forestry Resources | The proposed project would not involve agricultural lands or Prime Farmland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Air Quality                    | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of pollutants or odors to sensitive receptors. Although Sacramento County is in nonattainment status for PM-2.5 (2006) and 8-Hour Ozone (2015) criteria pollutants, the proposed project would not result in a significant net increase of such pollutants, nor would the project conflict with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)'s ability to comply with any applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP). |
| Biological Resources           | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect an HCP, NCCP, or other sensitive biological resources. The school campus is not expected to contain Elderberry (Sambucus sp.); however, if any are required to be removed, a pre-construction survey would be necessary to ensure Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle habitat is not present. Additional project commitments include a pre-construction nesting bird survey or limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting period to avoid non-compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If active nests are to be found during a nesting bird survey, no-work buffer areas would be established in consultation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). |
| Cultural Resources             | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not suspected to contain archeological artifacts. In the event that archeological or cultural resources are discovered onsite, work would cease immediately until consultation and approval to continue work are provided by a qualified archeologist.                                                                 |
| Energy                         | The proposed project would not result in an impact related to the wasteful or inefficient use of energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Lichen K-8 School Site Security Project  
CEQA Categorical Exemption  
Terracon Project No: NB237387  

---

**Project Information:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Lichen K-8 School’s campus at 8319 Lichen Drive (APN: 209-0330-002), in Citrus Heights, California. The project area spans approximately 1,200 feet of paved, landscaped, and recreational areas within the school’s boundaries (Exhibit 1). The project scope includes the construction of site fencing and gates along the school frontage, primarily adjacent to the northern and eastern campus boundaries. The project will also include the construction and installation of an electronic gate, multiple pedestrian gates, and maintenance gates.

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

---

**Legal Setting:**  
Categorical Exemptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300)  
Projects that are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact may be Categorically Exempt from CEQA review. As described in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300, Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires these guidelines to include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. In response to that mandate, the Secretary for Resources has found that the following classes of projects listed in this article do not have a significant effect on the environment, and they are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.

Like many school-maintenance projects (that do not involve additional classrooms or student capacity), the proposed project is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts under CEQA.

| Impact Category               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aesthetics                    | The project would not result in impacts related to scenic vistas, state-listed scenic highways. Any new lighting associated with the proposed project would be consistent with previous conditions and would not result in an impact on Aesthetics.                                                                                       |
| Agriculture and Forestry Resources | The proposed project would not involve agricultural lands or Prime Farmland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Air Quality                   | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of pollutants or odors to sensitive receptors. Although Sacramento County is in nonattainment status for PM-2.5 (2006) and 8-Hour Ozone (2015) criteria pollutants, the proposed project would not result in a significant net increase of such pollutants, nor would the project conflict with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)’s ability to comply with any applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP). |
| Biological Resources          | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect an HCP, NCCP, or other sensitive biological resources. The school campus is not expected to contain Elderberry (Sambucus sp.); however, if any are required to be removed, a pre-construction survey would be necessary to ensure Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle habitat is not present. Additional project commitments include a pre-construction nesting bird survey or limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting period to avoid non-compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If active nests are to be found during a nesting bird survey, no-work buffer areas would be established in consultation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). |
| Cultural Resources            | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not suspected to contain archeological artifacts. In the event that archeological or cultural resources are discovered onsite, work would cease immediately until consultation and approval to continue work was provided by a qualified archeologist.                                                                 |
| Energy                        | The proposed project would not result in an impact related to the wasteful or inefficient use of energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Geology and Soils**                | The proposed project would not result in geological impacts. The project construction would take place on existing pavement and would not result in new construction in unsafe soils.                                                         |
| **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**         | Although greenhouse gases would be emitted during project construction, it would not result in a significant impact on the environment, nor would it conflict with a plan, policy, or regulation aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. |
| **Hazards and Hazardous Materials**   | The proposed project would not involve the use or release of potentially hazardous substances. Abatement of Hazardous Materials Plan (AHMP) will be created prior to project construction to handle potential unexpected encounters with hazardous materials. |
| **Hydrology and Water Quality**      | Local water quality impacts would be avoided by the usage of routing stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) during construction and material staging activities.                                                                         |
| **Land Use and Planning**            | The proposed project would not divide an established community, nor would it result in a conflict with a land use plan or zoning ordinance.                                                                                                 |
| **Mineral Resources**                | The proposed project would not involve Mineral Resources.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Noise**                             | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of excessive noise levels. Construction would not take place during the school year. Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts. |
| **Population and Housing**            | The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Public Services**                  | The proposed project would not negatively affect public services, but instead would improve the school's ability to provide security for their students.                                                                                      |
| **Recreation**                       | The proposed project would not lead to the deterioration of existing recreational facilities, nor would it involve the construction of new facilities that would result in an adverse physical environmental consequence.                       |

![Terracon Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Terracon+Document)

**Transportation**  
The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation, because construction would occur outside of the school year when student traffic patterns would not be affected by the work.

**Tribal Cultural Resources**  
The proposed project would not have the capability to impact a listed or eligible resource.

**Wildfire**  
The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards.

**Mandatory Findings of Significance**  
The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact.

---

**Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)**  
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located - a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified Environmental Impact Report (EIR).

(e) **Hazardous Waste Sites.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) **Historical Resources.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

![Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314)](https://example.com/image)

**Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314)**  
Class 14 projects are described in § 15314 as "minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less." The project would take place entirely within Lichen K-8 School's existing property and would not involve the addition of any new classrooms, nor would it affect the school's student capacity. The proposed project fits the description provided in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314.

**Summary:**  
The proposed project would not result in any significant impacts to the environment (please see Table 1). The activities that make up the proposed project (installation of fences and gates, vegetation removal, landscaping, installation of safety lights and cameras, etc.) meet both the description of a Class 14-exempt project as well as the criteria listed in the Exceptions to CEQA Categorical Exemptions. The project area is not located on a hazard waste site or other environmental feature of critical concern. The proposed project would not result in a significant impact, nor would it result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant cumulative impact.

The long-term effects of the project are likely to be beneficial for the safety of the school and community. The project site is not in the vicinity of a Scenic Highway, and the project would not be expected to impact historical resources. No historic properties are known to exist in the project area; if artifacts were to be found during construction, work would stop immediately, and a qualified archeologist would be consulted with before work were to resume.

Avoidance and minimization measures would be incorporated to avoid impacts to biological resources. Such measures include limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting season (Feb 1 through Aug 31). Alternatively, if vegetation removal was needed during the nesting period, a nesting bird survey would be required. If nesting or migratory birds were found, the San Joaquin Unified School District would be responsible for establishing no-work buffers, as necessary, with the input of CDFW, before the commencement of construction or tree removal activities.

Considering the data summarized in this memorandum, it is Terracon’s opinion that the Lichen K-8 School Site Security Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA documentation.

RE:  
Mesa Verde High School Site Security Project  
CEQA Categorical Exemption  
Terracon Project No: NB237386  

**Project Information:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Mesa Verde High School’s campus at 7501 Carriage Drive (APN: 204-0220-001), in Citrus Heights, California. The project area spans approximately 1,400 feet of paved, landscaped, and recreational areas within the school’s boundaries (Exhibit 1). The project scope includes the construction of site fencing and gates along the school frontage towards the northern campus boundary and center of campus. The project will also include the construction and installation of an electronic gate, multiple pedestrian gates, and maintenance gates.

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

**Legal Setting:**  
Categorical Exemptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300)  
Projects that are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact may be Categorically Exempt from CEQA review. As described in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300, Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires these guidelines to include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. In response to that mandate, the Secretary for Resources has found that the following classes of projects listed in this article do not have a significant effect on the environment, and they are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.

Like many school-maintenance projects (that do not involve additional classrooms or student capacity), the proposed project is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts under CEQA.

|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aesthetics                    | The project would not result in impacts related to scenic vistas, state-listed scenic highways. Any new lighting associated with the proposed project would be consistent with previous conditions and would not result in an impact on Aesthetics.                                                                                                          |
| Agriculture and Forestry Resources | The proposed project would not involve agricultural lands or Prime Farmland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Air Quality                   | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of pollutants or odors to sensitive receptors. Although Sacramento County is in nonattainment status for PM-2.5 (2006) and 8-Hour Ozone (2015) criteria pollutants, the proposed project would not result in a significant net increase of such pollutants, nor would the project conflict with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)'s ability to comply with any applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP). |
| Biological Resources          | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect an HCP, NCCP, or other sensitive biological resources. The school campus is not expected to contain Elderberry (Sambucus sp.); however, if any are required to be removed, a pre-construction survey would be necessary to ensure Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle habitat is not present. Additional project commitments include a pre-construction nesting bird survey or limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting period to avoid non-compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If active nests are to be found during a nesting bird survey, no-work buffer areas would be established in consultation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). |
| Cultural Resources            | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not suspected to contain archeological artifacts. In the event that archeological or cultural resources are discovered onsite, work would cease immediately until consultation and approval to continue work was provided by a qualified archeologist.                                                                 |
| Energy                        | The proposed project would not result in an impact related to the wasteful or inefficient use of energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**Geology and Soils**  
The proposed project would not result in geological impacts. The project construction would take place on existing pavement and would not result in new construction in unsafe soils.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
Although greenhouse gases would be emitted during project construction, it would not result in a significant impact on the environment, nor would it conflict with a plan, policy, or regulation aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

**Hazards and Hazardous Materials**  
The proposed project would not involve the use or release of potentially hazardous substances. Abatement of Hazardous Materials Plan (AHMP) will be created prior to project construction to handle potential unexpected encounters with hazardous materials.

**Hydrology and Water Quality**  
Local water quality impacts would be avoided by the usage of routing stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) during construction and material staging activities.

**Land Use and Planning**  
The proposed project would not divide an established community, nor would it result in a conflict with a land use plan or zoning ordinance.

**Mineral Resources**  
The proposed project would not involve Mineral Resources.

**Noise**  
The proposed project would not result in the exposure of excessive noise levels. Construction would not take place during the school year. Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts.

**Population and Housing**  
The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth.

**Public Services**  
The proposed project would not negatively affect public services, but instead would improve the school's ability to provide security for their students.

**Recreation**  
The proposed project would not lead to the deterioration of existing recreational facilities, nor would it involve the construction of new facilities that would result in an adverse physical environmental consequence.

The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation, because construction would occur outside of the school year when student traffic patterns would not be affected by the work.

**Tribal Cultural Resources**  
The proposed project would not have the capability to impact a listed or eligible resource.

**Wildfire**  
The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards.

**Mandatory Findings of Significance**  
The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact.

---

**Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)**  
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located - a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified Environmental Impact Report (EIR).

(e) **Hazardous Waste Sites.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) **Historical Resources.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

![Terracon Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Terracon+Document)

Class 14 projects are described in § 15314 as "minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less." The project would take place entirely within Mesa Verde High School's existing property and would not involve the addition of any new classrooms, nor would it affect the school's student capacity. The proposed project fits the description provided in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314.

**Summary:**
The proposed project would not result in any significant impacts to the environment (please see Table 1). The activities that make up the proposed project (installation of fences and gates, vegetation removal, landscaping, installation of safety lights and cameras, etc.) meet both the description of a Class 14-exempt project as well as the criteria listed in the Exceptions to CEQA Categorical Exemptions. The project area is not located on a hazard waste site or other environmental feature of critical concern. The proposed project would not result in a significant impact, nor would it result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant cumulative impact.

The long-term effects of the project are likely to be beneficial for the safety of the school and community. The project site is not in the vicinity of a Scenic Highway, and the project would not be expected to impact historical resources. No historic properties are known to exist in the project area; if artifacts were to be found during construction, work would stop immediately, and a qualified archeologist would be consulted before work were to resume.

Avoidance and minimization measure would be incorporated to avoid impacts to biological resources. Such measures include limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting season (Feb 1 through Aug 31). Alternatively, if vegetation removal was needed during the nesting period, a nesting bird survey would be required. If nesting or migratory birds were found, the San Joaquin Unified School District would be responsible for establishing no-work buffers, as necessary, with the input of CDFW, before the commencement of construction or tree removal activities.

Considering the data summarized in this memorandum, it is Terracon's opinion that the Mesa Verde High School Site Security Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA documentation.

Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts.

**Population and Housing**  
The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth.

**Public Services**  
The proposed project would not negatively affect public services, but instead would improve the school’s ability to provide security for their students.

**Recreation**  
The proposed project would not lead to the deterioration of existing recreational facilities, nor would it involve the construction of new facilities that would result in an adverse physical environmental consequence.

**Transportation**  
The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation, because construction would occur outside of the school year when student traffic patterns would not be affected by the work.

**Tribal Cultural Resources**  
The proposed project would not have the capability to impact a listed or eligible resource.

**Wildlife**  
The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards.

**Mandatory Findings of Significance**  
The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact.

**Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)**  
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located - a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply in all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern, where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified Environmental Impact Report (EIR).

(e) **Hazardous Waste Sites.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) **Historical Resources.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

![Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314)](https://www.terracon.com)

**Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314)**  
Class 14 projects are described in § 15314 as "minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less." The project would take place entirely within Orangevale K-8 School's existing property and would not involve the addition of any new classrooms, nor would it affect the school's student capacity. The proposed project fits the description provided in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314.

**Summary:**  
The proposed project would not result in any significant impacts to the environment (please see Table 1). The activities that make up the proposed project (installation of fences and gates, vegetation removal, landscaping, installation of safety lights and cameras, etc.) meet both the description of a Class 14-exempt project as well as the criteria listed in the Exceptions to CEQA Categorical Exemptions. The project area is not located on a hazard waste site or other environmental feature of critical concern. The proposed project would not result in a significant impact, nor would it result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant cumulative impact.

The long-term effects of the project are likely to be beneficial for the safety of the school and community. The project site is not in the vicinity of a Scenic Highway, and the project would not be expected to impact historical resources. No historic properties are known to exist in the project area; if artifacts were to be found during construction, work would stop immediately, and a qualified archeologist would be consulted with before work was to resume.

Avoidance and minimization measures would be incorporated to avoid impacts to biological resources. Such measures include limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting season (Feb 1 through Aug 31). Alternatively, if vegetation removal was needed during the nesting period, a nesting bird survey would be required. If nesting or migratory birds were found, the San Juan Unified School District would be responsible for establishing no-work buffers, as necessary, with the input of CDFW, before the commencement of construction or tree removal activities.

Considering the data summarized in this memorandum, it is Terracon’s opinion that the Orangevale Open K-8 School Site Security Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA documentation.

**Project Information:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Schweitzer Elementary School’s campus at 4350 Glenridge Drive (APN: 247-0060-032), in Carmichael, California. The project area spans approximately 400 feet of paved, landscaped, and recreational areas within the school’s boundaries (Exhibit 1). The project scope includes the construction of site fencing and gates along the school frontage, primarily towards the southwestern corner of campus. The project will also include the construction and installation of an electronic gate, multiple pedestrian gates, and maintenance gates throughout the campus boundary.

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

**Legal Setting:**  
Categorical Exemptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300)  
Projects that are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact may be Categorically Exempt from CEQA review. As described in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300, Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires these guidelines to include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. In response to that mandate, the Secretary for Resources has found that the following classes of projects listed in this article do not have a significant effect on the environment, and they are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.

Like many school-maintenance projects (that do not involve additional classrooms or student capacity), the proposed project is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts under CEQA. Table 1 provides an abbreviated CEQA checklist, explaining why the implementation of the proposed project would not result in any significant environmental impacts.

**Table 1. Abbreviated CEQA Environmental Checklist**

| Impact Category                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aesthetics                     | The project would not result in impacts related to scenic vistas, state-listed scenic highways. Any new lighting associated with the proposed project would be consistent with previous conditions and would not result in an impact on Aesthetics.                                                                                                      |
| Agriculture and Forestry Resources | The proposed project would not involve agricultural lands or Prime Farmland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Air Quality                    | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of pollutants or odors to sensitive receptors. Although Sacramento County is in nonattainment status for PM-2.5 (2006) and 8-Hour Ozone (2015) criteria pollutants, the proposed project would not result in a significant net increase of such pollutants, nor would the project conflict with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)'s ability to comply with any applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP). |
| Biological Resources           | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect an HCP, NCCP, or other sensitive biological resources. The school campus is not expected to contain Elderberry (Sambucus sp.); however, if any are required to be removed, a pre-construction survey would be necessary to ensure Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle habitat is not present. Additional project commitments include a pre-construction nesting bird survey or limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting period to avoid non-compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If active nests are to be found during a nesting bird survey, no-work buffer areas would be established in consultation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). |
| Cultural Resources             | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not suspected to contain archeological artifacts. In the event that archeological or cultural resources are discovered onsite, work would cease immediately until consultation and approval to continue work was provided by a qualified archeologist.                                                                 |

**Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)**  
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located – a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply in all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified Environmental Impact Report (EIR).

(e) **Hazardous Waste Sites.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) **Historical Resources.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

**Project Information:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Sierra Oaks K-8 School’s campus at 171 Mills Road (APNs: 293-0012-013 & 293-0230-001), in Sacramento, California. The project area spans approximately 930 feet of paved, landscaped, and recreational areas within the school’s boundaries (Exhibit 1). The project scope includes the construction of site fencing and gates along the school frontage, towards the northwestern corner and eastern campus boundary. The project will also include the construction and installation of an electronic gate, multiple pedestrian gates, and maintenance gates.

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

---

**Legal Setting:**  
Categorical Exemptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300)  
Projects that are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact may be Categorically Exempt from CEQA review. As described in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300, Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires these guidelines to include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. In response to that mandate, the Secretary for Resources has found that the following classes of projects listed in this article do not have a significant effect on the environment, and they are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.

Like many school-maintenance projects (that do not involve additional classrooms or student capacity), the proposed project is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts under CEQA.

|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aesthetics                    | The project would not result in impacts related to scenic vistas, state-listed scenic highways. Any new lighting associated with the proposed project would be consistent with previous conditions and would not result in an impact on Aesthetics.                                                                                       |
| Agriculture and Forestry Resources | The proposed project would not involve agricultural lands or Prime Farmland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Air Quality                   | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of pollutants or odors to sensitive receptors. Although Sacramento County is in nonattainment status for PM-2.5 (2006) and 8-Hour Ozone (2015) criteria pollutants, the proposed project would not result in a significant net increase of such pollutants, nor would the project conflict with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)'s ability to comply with any applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP). |
| Biological Resources          | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect an HCP, NCCP, or other sensitive biological resources. The school campus is not expected to contain Elderberry (Sambucus sp.); however, if any are required to be removed, a pre-construction survey would be necessary to ensure Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle habitat is not present. Additional project commitments include a pre-construction nesting bird survey or limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting period to avoid non-compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If active nests are to be found during a nesting bird survey, no-work buffer areas would be established in consultation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). |
| Cultural Resources            | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not suspected to contain archeological artifacts. In the event that archeological or cultural resources are discovered onsite, work would cease immediately until consultation and approval to continue work was provided by a qualified archeologist.                                                                 |
| Energy                        | The proposed project would not result in an impact related to the wasteful or inefficient use of energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Geology and Soils**  
The proposed project would not result in geological impacts. The project construction would take place on pavement and would not result in new construction in unsafe soils.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
Although greenhouse gases would be emitted during project construction, it would not result in a significant impact on the environment, nor would it conflict with a plan, policy, or regulation aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

**Hazards and Hazardous Materials**  
The proposed project would not involve the use or release of potentially hazardous substances. Abatement of Hazardous Materials Plan (AHMP) will be created prior to project construction to handle potential unexpected encounters with hazardous materials.

**Hydrology and Water Quality**  
Local water quality impacts would be avoided by the usage of routing stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) during construction and material staging activities.

**Land Use and Planning**  
The proposed project would not divide an established community, nor would it result in a conflict with a land use plan or zoning ordinance.

**Mineral Resources**  
The proposed project would not involve Mineral Resources.

**Noise**  
The proposed project would not result in the exposure of excessive noise levels. Construction would not take place during the school year. Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts.

**Population and Housing**  
The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth.

**Public Services**  
The proposed project would not negatively affect public services, but instead would improve the school’s ability to provide security for their students.

**Recreation**  
The proposed project would not lead to the deterioration of existing recreational facilities, nor would it involve the construction of new facilities that would result in an adverse physical environmental consequence.

The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation, because construction would occur outside of the school year when student traffic patterns would not be affected by the work.

**Transportation**  
The proposed project would not have the capability to impact a listed or eligible resource.

**Tribal Cultural Resources**  
The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards.

**Wildfire**  
The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact.

**Mandatory Findings of Significance**

**Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)**  
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located - a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified Environmental Impact Report (EIR).

(e) **Hazardous Waste Sites.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) **Historical Resources.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

![Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs.tit. 14 § 15314)](https://www.terracon.com)

**Summary:**
The proposed project would not result in any significant impacts to the environment (please see Table 1). The activities that make up the proposed project (installation of fences and gates, vegetation removal, landscaping, installation of safety lights and cameras, etc.) meet both the description of a Class 14-exempt project as well as the criteria listed in the Exceptions to CEQA Categorical Exemptions. The project area is not located on a hazard waste site or other environmental feature of critical concern. The proposed project would not result in a significant impact, nor would it result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant cumulative impact.

The long-term effects of the project are likely to be beneficial for the safety of the school and community. The project site is not in the vicinity of a Scenic Highway, and the project would not be expected to impact historical resources. No historic properties are known to exist in the project area; if artifacts were to be found during construction, work would stop immediately, and a qualified archeologist would be consulted with before work were to resume.

Avoidance and minimization measures would be incorporated to avoid impacts to biological resources. Such measures include limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting season (Feb 1 through Aug 31). Alternatively, if vegetation removal was needed during the nesting period, a nesting bird survey would be required. If nesting or migratory birds were found, the San Juan Unified School District would be responsible for establishing no-work buffers, as necessary, with the input of CDFW, before the commencement of construction or tree removal activities.

Considering the data summarized in this memorandum, it is Terracon’s opinion that the Sierra Oaks K-8 School Site Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA documentation.

**Transportation**  
The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation, because construction would occur outside of the school year when student traffic patterns would not be affected by the work.

**Tribal Cultural Resources**  
The proposed project would not have the capability to impact a listed or eligible resource.

**Wildfire**  
The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards.

**Mandatory Findings of Significance**  
The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact.

---

**Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)**  
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located – a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified Environmental Impact Report (EIR).

(e) **Hazardous Waste Sites.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) **Historical Resources.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

**Project Information:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Winston Churchill Middle School’s campus at 4900 Whitney Avenue (APN: 256-0160-003), in Carmichael, California. The project area spans approximately 580 feet of paved, landscaped, and recreational the school’s boundaries (Exhibit 1). The project scope includes the construction of site fencing and gates along the school frontage throughout the campus. The project will also include the construction and installation of an electronic gate, multiple pedestrian gates, and maintenance gates.

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

---

**Legal Setting:**  
Categorical Exemptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300)  
Projects that are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact may be Categorically Exempt from CEQA review. As described in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300, Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires these guidelines to include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. In response to that mandate, the Secretary for Resources has found that the following classes of projects listed in this article do not have a significant effect on the environment, and they are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.

Like many school-maintenance projects (that do not involve additional classrooms or student capacity), the proposed project is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts under CEQA.

| Impact Category                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aesthetics                    | The project would not result in impacts related to scenic vistas, state-listed scenic highways. Any new lighting associated with the proposed project would be consistent with previous conditions and would not result in an impact on Aesthetics. |
| Agriculture and Forestry Resources | The proposed project would not involve agricultural lands or Prime Farmland.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Air Quality                   | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of pollutants or odors to sensitive receptors. Although Sacramento County is in nonattainment status for PM-2.5 (2006) and 8-Hour Ozone (2015) criteria pollutants, the proposed project would not result in a significant net increase of such pollutants, nor would the project conflict with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)'s ability to comply with any applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP). |
| Biological Resources          | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect an HCP, NCCP, or other sensitive biological resources. The school campus is not expected to contain Elderberry (Sambucus sp.); however, if any are required to be removed, a pre-construction survey would be necessary to ensure Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle habitat is not present. Additional project commitments include a pre-construction nesting bird survey or limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting period to avoid non-compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If active nests are to be found during a nesting bird survey, no-work buffer areas would be established in consultation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). |
| Cultural Resources            | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not suspected to contain archeological artifacts. In the event that archeological or cultural resources are discovered onsite, work would cease immediately until consultation and approval to continue work are provided by a qualified archeologist. |
| Energy                        | The proposed project would not result in an impact related to the wasteful or inefficient use of energy.                                                                                                                                                     |

**Geology and Soils**  
The proposed project would not result in geological impacts. The project construction would take place on existing pavement and would not result in new construction in unsafe soils.

**Greenhouse Gas Emissions**  
Although greenhouse gases would be emitted during project construction, it would not result in a significant impact on the environment, nor would it conflict with a plan, policy, or regulation aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

**Hazards and Hazardous Materials**  
The proposed project would not involve the use or release of potentially hazardous substances. Abatement of Hazardous Materials Plan (AHMP) will be created prior to project construction to handle potential unexpected encounters with hazardous materials.

**Hydrology and Water Quality**  
Local water quality impacts would be avoided by the usage of routing stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) during construction and material staging activities.

**Land Use and Planning**  
The proposed project would not divide an established community, nor would it result in a conflict with a land use plan or zoning ordinance.

**Mineral Resources**  
The proposed project would not involve Mineral Resources.

**Noise**  
The proposed project would not result in the exposure of excessive noise levels. Construction would not take place during the school year. Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts.

**Population and Housing**  
The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth.

**Public Services**  
The proposed project would not negatively affect public services, but instead would improve the school’s ability to provide security for their students.

**Recreation**  
The proposed project would not lead to the deterioration of existing recreational facilities, nor would it involve the construction of new facilities that would result in an adverse physical environmental consequence.

**Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)**  
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located – a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified Environmental Impact Report (EIR).

(e) **Hazardous Waste Sites.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) **Historical Resources.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

![Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314)](https://example.com/image)

**Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314)**  
Class 14 projects are described in § 15314 as "minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less." The project would take place entirely within Winston Churchill Middle School’s existing property and would not involve the addition of any new classrooms, nor would it affect the school’s student capacity. The proposed project fits the description provided in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314.

**Summary:**  
The proposed project would not result in any significant impacts to the environment (please see Table 1). The activities that make up the proposed project (installation of fences and gates, vegetation removal, landscaping, installation of safety lights and cameras, etc.) meet both the description of a Class 14-exempt project as well as the criteria listed in the Exceptions to CEQA Categorical Exemptions. The project area is not located on a hazard waste site or other environmental feature of critical concern. The proposed project would not result in a significant impact, nor would it result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant cumulative impact.

The long-term effects of the project are likely to be beneficial for the safety of the school and community. The project site is not in the vicinity of a Scenic Highway, and the project would not be expected to impact historical resources. No historic properties are known to exist in the project area; if artifacts are found during construction, work would stop immediately, and a qualified archeologist would be consulted with before work were to resume.

Avoidance and minimization measures would be incorporated to avoid impacts to biological resources. Such measures include limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting season (Feb 1 through Aug 31). Alternatively, if vegetation removal was needed during the nesting period, a nesting bird survey would be required. If nesting or migratory birds were found, the San Joaquin Unified School District would be responsible for establishing no-work buffers, as necessary, with the input of CDFW, before the commencement of construction or tree removal activities.

Considering the data summarized in this memorandum, it is Terracon’s opinion that the Winston Churchill Middle School Site Security Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA documentation.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
## BOARD OF EDUCATION

### AGENDA ITEM: I-1
### MEETING DATE: 02/13/2024

**SUBJECT:** Strategic Planning Update  
**DEPARTMENT:** Administration  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent recommends that the board receive a report on our district’s strategic plan development.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
San Juan Unified is in the process of creating a new strategic plan, which will serve as a roadmap to prioritize efforts and align resources.

The strategic plan development process began in the fall and included a wide range of voice collection across the district with a variety of students, families, staff, and community. From community workshops, virtual and in-person focus groups, and student feedback forums, to lunchtime popups at schools, surveys, and individual interviews—the focus on co-creating a collaborative, student-centered strategic plan has been a driving theme throughout the process.

The Strategic Core Planning team and the Strategic Design team met the last week of January to review the feedback that’s been collected and draft the strategic roadmap, which will be shared with our community who will be asked to provide feedback this spring. Based on that feedback, the Strategic Core Planning and Strategic Design teams will then meet again to finalize a draft that will be presented to the Board for review and action in May.

# 01 | Background

In the Fall of 2023, CESO Communications (CESO) contracted with San Juan Unified School District (San Juan Unified) to facilitate a strategic planning process to guide the work of the district over the next five years.

Following initial conversations with the district, as well as a review of the district’s previous strategic work, community surveys and additional district data, CESO conducted a comprehensive community engagement process that included students, staff, parents and community members in November and December 2023.

The goal of this initial phase of the strategic planning process was to provide a variety of engagement activities that allowed individuals from across community member groups to share their input. A combination of in-person and virtual engagements was used to solicit insight from community members, which allowed participants to share their thoughts at times and in ways that were most convenient for them. There was also an effort to intentionally include student voices in the process to create a strategic plan that represents the true mission and vision of the school system.

Insights from these engagements have been included in this report. This report, along with other district reports, strategic initiatives and data will inform the work of the Core Planning Team and Design Team when they meet in January and February to develop a draft strategic plan.

# 02 | Engagement Process & Activities

In November and December 2023, the district held several in-person and virtual engagements that included personal interviews; focus groups and collaborative workshops with current students, staff, parents/families, alumni and community members; and open input opportunities for students and families. An online conversation was also available for all members of the San Juan Unified community to weigh in with their thoughts and insights via ThoughtExchange.

To keep participants focused on the future and not on current topics or concerns, the district set out to answer the following key question:

What do San Juan Unified students need to be  
PREPARED for their next step and HOPEFUL for their future?
<!-- Page 149 -->
![Engagement Formats & Participation](https://www.example.com/image-url)

Engagement Formats & Participation  
San Juan students, families, staff and community members were invited to participate in a variety of engagements. In-person sessions included focus groups, open insight opportunities, and consensus workshops. Interviews were conducted with school board members, the superintendent and identified community leaders. Virtual conversations included using the district's ThoughtExchange platform, surveys and Zoom-based focus groups.

*An analysis of the insights from all engagements is included later in this report as part of the key themes and findings.*

**Focus Groups**  
Several in-person and virtual focus groups were held to gather feedback from staff, parents, and community members. In each session, participants were asked to provide their insights about the current reality for students in San Juan Unified, suggestions for improvement, and ideas for further supporting district students and families.

**Consensus Workshops**  
San Juan students, families, staff and community members were invited to participate in facilitated engagements. Each in-person session was structured as a facilitated consensus workshop, providing opportunity for participants to provide their insights through individual brainstorming as well as small and large group discussions.

*An analysis of the ideas from the consensus workshops is incorporated into the key themes later in this report, with the raw data included in the appendix.*

**Student Session**  
The student consensus workshop involved 85 high school students representing all the high schools in the district. Conversations focused on two workshop questions: what do students need to feel prepared and hopeful for their future, and what do students need to feel a sense of belonging in their school.

<!-- Page 150 -->
![Open Community Session](https://example.com/image1.jpg)  
Open Community Session  
Two open community consensus workshops were held for all staff, families and community members. Conversations focused on two questions: what do students need to feel prepared and hopeful for their future, and what do parents/families need to feel welcomed, valued and motivated to be involved in their student’s education.  

![Open Insight Sessions](https://example.com/image2.jpg)  
Open Insight Sessions  
The district offered several open insight sessions, including pop-up engagements at K-8 sites to get student insights on hopes and dreams as well as suggestions for improvement. In addition, the district posted banners at schools for parents/families to offer their insights.  

![Banner for Insights](https://example.com/image3.jpg)

**Interviews**  
CESO Communications also conducted personal interviews with each member of the San Juan Unified School Board and the Superintendent. Interview questions were similar to the questions asked in other focus groups, with an additional focus on leadership of the district, their hopes for the strategic planning process, and their visions for the future.

In addition, the district identified community leaders for personal interviews. Again, the interviews focused on what the district should focus on in the future to better support students and families, with an additional focus on community and civic partnerships.

**Surveys**  
The district also included surveys for identified audiences to ensure wide representation in the engagement phase. Students in middle school and high school were administered a survey in November 2023. Questions were similar to those of the focus groups, seeking insight on how prepared students feel for life after graduation, what skills they feel they need for adulthood, and ideas about what teachers and staff can do to help them feel more prepared and valued in the district.

In total, 438 students participated, 98% of whom took the survey in English, and a small percentage in Russian. Responses were nearly evenly distributed among grade levels:
- Grade 6 - 10%
- Grade 7 - 15%
- Grade 8 - 15%
- Grade 9 - 18%
- Grade 10 - 17%
- Grades 11 - 14%
- Grade 12 - 11%

The district also surveyed community partners. Again, questions focused on what skills students need for adulthood and how the district can support students and families.

**ThoughtExchange**  
In addition to the engagements outlined above, all members of the San Juan Unified School District community were invited to participate in an online conversation via the district’s ThoughtExchange platform. The conversation was combined with data gathering for the district's annual LCAP process, focusing on what the district is doing well and what it can do better to support students and families. The exchange was open for participation for six weeks in October and November 2023, and garnered significant input, with more than 600 participants providing nearly 577 thoughts. The majority (94%) of participants in the exchange did so in English. Additional responses were captured in Spanish (2%), Russian (2%) and Persian (1%).

* An analysis of the ideas shared in the ThoughtExchange is incorporated into the key themes later in this report, with a more detailed analysis included in the appendix.

**PROCESS**  
The digital engagement platform ThoughtExchange was used to facilitate the online engagement of San Juan Unified students, staff, parents, and community members by providing a virtual environment in which they were able to respond to some brief survey questions and a general prompt question. Participants were also able to rate and respond to the comments of other respondents.

ThoughtExchange operates as both a survey on some baseline questions and an online conversation in which participants generate ideas and feedback and build a sense of consensus on topics. Participation is not only about posting responses but also about sharing reactions, feelings, and suggestions about the comments and responses of others.

**TIMELINE & COMMUNICATION**  
The platform was open from October 5 - November 18, 2023. The district shared messaging about the exchange through various channels to invite and encourage participation.

**EXCHANGE QUESTION**  
As for the virtual conversation, participants were asked to engage with the following prompt question:  
*What are some things our schools are doing well to support students and families, and what are some things our schools should do differently to improve support for students and families?*

**PARTICIPATION**  
Of those who participated in the virtual discussion, engagement was strong. The online platform garnered significant input, with over 600 participants providing nearly 600 thoughts.

| Participants | Thoughts | Ratings |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| 608          | 577      | 15,629  |
|              | 0.9 thoughts/participant | 25.7 ratings/participant |

**Participation Demographics**  
While participants could choose more than one affiliation with the district, the exchange included mostly parents/guardians (80%), followed by district staff (17%). A small number of participants identified as community members (2%) and a handful identified as current students. The majority (54%) of parent respondents said they had children at the elementary level, with approximately one-quarter noting association with middle school (26%) or high school (28%).

The racial/ethnic demographics show 61% of respondents identifying as white, 15% as Hispanic or Latino/a/x, 9% noting two or more races, and 5% as African American or Black. Approximately 15% of respondents opted not to identify their race/ethnicity.

Additionally, respondents were asked to identify their relationship with special populations, with 5% noting they had a student with disabilities, 2% each as English learners and/or socioeconomically disadvantaged, and 1% each as homeless and/or foster youth.

**Level of Engagement**  
The exchange also indicated a strong level of engagement, with a ratings ratio of 27. The ratings ratio measures engagement in the exchange topic. A ratings ratio of 15 or higher shows strong engagement.

**ADDITIONAL EXCHANGE**  
An additional ThoughtExchange was conducted with after-school staff, allowing their insights to be included in the research phase of the planning process. Twenty-two staff participated in the exchange, and 25 thoughts were submitted. The majority (71%) of participants identified as Bridges staff, whereas 29% identified with Discovery Club. The vast majority (95%) of participants have worked in the district for more than five years, with the other 5% identifying a district tenure of one to three years.

It should also be noted that in every group, participants held conversations about the changing demographics of the district, with special attention paid to newcomer families.

# LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN (LCAP)

---

# LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA

### BASE GRANT
Every student generates a base grant, which funds basic educational costs such as teacher salaries, retirement costs, instructional materials, etc.

### SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT
Every student identified as low-income, English learner, or foster youth generates an additional 20% more funding above the base grant.  
These funds must be spent on increasing and improving services for these priority student groups.

### CONCENTRATION GRANT
Every student identified as low-income, English learner, or foster youth above the 55% district enrollment threshold generates additional funding based on a state funding formula.  
These funds must be spent on increasing and improving services for these priority student groups.

![Attachment B: 2023 California School Dashboard Results](https://www.caschooldashboard.org/)

**Changes to the Dashboard**  
The California School Dashboard reports how districts and schools are performing on multiple state and local measures that make up California’s accountability system. Last year, the 2022 Dashboard reported current year performance levels only to show “status” using one of five levels ranging from Very High to Very Low. This year, however, the 2023 Dashboard will return to reporting performance levels using colors: blue, green, yellow, orange, and red. These performance levels were determined using two years of data and report the difference between 2023 current year performance (“status”) and 2022 prior year performance to show growth or decline (“change”) over time.

**2023 Dashboard: “Change” – Difference between current year performance and prior year performance**  
- RED: LOWEST PERFORMANCE  
- ORANGE  
- YELLOW  
- GREEN  
- BLUE: HIGHEST PERFORMANCE  

**2022 Dashboard: “Status” – Current year performance**  
- VERY LOW  
- LOW  
- MEDIUM  
- HIGH  
- VERY HIGH  

**Participation Rate Penalty**  
In 2021-22, a penalty went into place for districts and schools not meeting a 95 percent participation rate on the CAASPP ELA and math. If a district, school, or student group did not meet the 95 percent participation rate requirement on the CAASPP, a penalty was applied to the academic indicator on the CA School Dashboard.

**Statewide Indicators**  
The sections below provide a description and the results of each Dashboard indicator by student group, year, and change. 2022 and 2023 results are provided as well as the CA School Dashboard performance level color to show the change between the two years. Additional information can be found at [https://www.caschooldashboard.org/](https://www.caschooldashboard.org/).

**Academic Performance**  
Academic Performance contains two measures: ELA and mathematics. They are based on student performance on the CAASPP, which are taken each spring by students in grades three through eight and grade eleven. Distance from Standard (DFS) is the measurement that the state uses to calculate these academic indicators on the CA School Dashboard. DFS represents the number of points above or below students are from meeting grade-level standards. Utilizing DFS emphasizes growth and improvement across all performance levels and represents a shift from only looking at the current year status of students meeting or exceeding standards.

# Successes

1) Choices educates all students in an equitable manner.

   A. 2023 CAASPP scores of CCS’s All Students and Student Subgroups demonstrate that Choices’ educational program is both effective and equitable:
   
   - CCS All Students:
     - Outperformed the State of California in Science
   - CCS Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students:
     - Outperformed the State of California in English Language Arts & Science
     - Performed as well as CCS All Students in English Language Arts & Math
   - CCS Students with Disabilities:
     - Outperformed the State of California in English Language Arts & Science
   - CCS English Learners (Ever-EL Students):
     - Outperformed the State of California in Science
     - Outperformed CCS All Students in Science

   B. 2023 Graduation Rates also demonstrate the equitable nature of the CCS program. CCS's Student Subgroups graduate at rates about the same or greater than CCS's All Students.
   
   - CCS All Students: 76%
   - CCS Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students: 74%
   - CCS Students with Disabilities: 82%

   C. 2023 Student Satisfaction Survey results confirm the equitability of the program:
   
   - 95% of students report that the program serves all students in an equitable (fair, unbiased, non-discriminatory) fashion.
   - 94% of students feel accepted and included.

2) Choices students typically enroll with deficiencies in skills and credits but grow academically while at CCS and graduate within five years.

   A. 2022-23 iReady data demonstrates academic growth experienced by Choices students after one semester of continuous enrollment:
   
   - The same or greater percentage of students perform at or above grade level:
     - Reading: 41% vs. 41%
     - Math: 16% vs. 23%
   - Fewer students perform at two or more years behind grade level:
     - Reading: 43% vs. 39%
     - Math: 63% vs. 47%
<!-- Page 251 -->
3) Students feel safe and cared for at Choices.

A. Data from the 2023 Students School Satisfaction Survey and the 2023 Students with Disabilities Attitude Survey demonstrates that students feel safe and cared for while they learn.
- 98% of All Students and 91% of Students with Disabilities report that they feel safe on campus.
- 97% of All Students feel that the Choices staff is caring and responsive to student needs.

4) While many Choices students cite anxiety as a primary reason for enrolling, more than half of them later state that they feel less anxiety since they enrolled at CCS.

A. Data from the 2023 Students School Satisfaction Survey and the 2023 Students with Disabilities Attitude Survey demonstrates that students experience less anxiety at Choices.
- 57% of All Students and 56% of Students with Disabilities report that they have experienced less anxiety since enrolling at Choices.

Challenges / Areas of Growth:
The following data points lag behind state averages; Choices is aware of these areas of need and is focused on growth through targeted action. LCAP funds will continue to target these areas of need where Choices expects to experience incremental growth.

1) College Career Indicator (College & Career Readiness)

A. Choices is actively promoting, through its WASC Graduation Outcomes, the accomplishment of individual goals through college and career planning and timely graduation. This process involves various practices, activities, and academic assignments that raise awareness, require reflection, and promote practical decision-making that builds a path toward the accomplishment of long-term objectives.

2) Math CAASPP Scores (Math Proficiency)

A. Two new dedicated Math teachers meet students where they are and assist them, with innovative practices and the support of a full-time tutor, to build skills while completing homework assignments. New Math courses that allow students to complete graduation requirements at a slower pace support students who need additional instruction, support, and practice of concepts.

- CCS’s Chronic Absenteeism lagged behind the state by less than one percent but placed in the Low (Orange) category, while the state placed in the Medium (Yellow) category.
- Mathematics proficiency levels were in the Very Low (Red) category, lagging behind the state, which placed in the Low (Orange) category. Math proficiency is consistently a challenge at Choices. Students typically enroll with significant gaps in skills and make progress once enrolled. Recent i-Ready data shows that students build skills quickly once at Choices, but this growth is not readily detected on CAASPP exams. About 70% of students have been at Choices for just one or two semesters when they take their CAASPP exams, so CAASPP scores are only a partially accurate reflection of the effectiveness of the education that Choices provides.
- CCS’s College/Career Indicator (CCI) was Low, while the state placed in the Medium category. Because Choices students often face more obstacles to their academic success than the average student, most prefer to pursue a more gradual approach to college and career, choosing to continue to community college, vocational school, or the work force after graduation. These options do not require students to participate in most of the activities that would identify them as “Prepared” on the Dashboard. Though this reality limits CCS’s ability to match state CCI averages, CCS recognizes that some growth in this area is needed.
- i-Ready data demonstrates CCS’s ability to build skills in students who enroll with significant deficiencies in Math and Reading. The graphs below illustrate student growth that took place during Fall 2022. The first set of graphs measures growth in the percentage of students who scored at or above grade level; the second set of graphs measures a reduction in the percentage of students who scored two or more years behind.

![Policy 0410: Nondiscrimination In District Programs And Activities](https://example.com/image.png)

**Policy 0410: Nondiscrimination In District Programs And Activities**  
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992 | **Last Revised Date:** 04/25/2023 | **Last Reviewed Date:** 04/25/2023  
**Status:** ADOPTED  

This policy shall apply to all acts related to a school activity or school attendance and to all acts of the governing board and the superintendent in enacting policies and procedures that govern the district.

The governing board is committed to providing equal opportunity for all individuals in district programs and activities. District programs, activities, and practices shall be free from unlawful discrimination, including discrimination against an individual or group based on race, color, ancestry, nationality, national origin, immigration status, ethnic group identification, ethnicity, age, religion, marital status, pregnancy, parental status, reproductive health decision-making, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sex (including sexual harassment), sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, veteran or military status, genetic information, or affiliation with the Boys Scouts of America; a perception of one or more such characteristics; or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. The board shall promote programs which ensure that discriminatory practices are eliminated in all district activities.

All individuals shall be treated equitably in the receipt of district and school services. Personally identifiable information collected in the implementation of any district program, including, but not limited to, student and family information for the free and reduced-price lunch program, transportation, or any other educational program, shall be used only for the purposes of the program, except when the superintendent or designee authorizes its use for another purpose in accordance with law. Resources and data collected by the district shall not be used, directly or by others, to compile a list, registry, or database of individuals based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, national origin, or immigration status or any other category identified above.

District programs and activities shall be free of any discriminatory use, selection, or rejection of textbooks, instructional materials, library books, or similar educational resources.

The use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library shall not be rejected or prohibited by the board or district on the basis that it includes a study of the role and contributions of any individual or group consistent with the requirements of Education Code 51204.5 and 60040, unless such study would violate Education Code 51501 or 60044. (Education Code 243)

District programs and activities shall be free of any racially derogatory or discriminatory school or athletic team names, mascots, or nicknames.

Physical education classes shall be conducted in the coeducational, inclusive manner prescribed by law. The district shall provide instruction in physical education that provides equal access and equal opportunities for participation for all students in grades 1-12 regardless of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, and mental or physical disability. (Education Code sections 220, 221.5, 33352; 5 CCR 4900, 4931, 4940, 4960; 34 CFR 106.33, 106.34, 300.108)

The superintendent or designee shall annually review district programs and activities to ensure the removal of any derogatory or discriminatory name, image, practice, or other barrier that may unlawfully prevent an individual or group in any of the protected categories stated above from accessing district programs and activities, including the use of facilities. They superintendent or designee shall take prompt,
<!-- Page 263 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x971.png?text=Document+Image)

reasonable actions to remove any identified barrier. The superintendent or designee shall report their findings and recommendations to the board after each review.

All allegations of unlawful discrimination in district programs and activities shall be brought, investigated and resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in ARBoard Policy 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.

Pursuant to 34 CFR 104.8 and 34 CFR 106.9, the superintendent or designee shall notify students, parents/guardians, employees, employee organizations, applicants for admission and employment, and sources of referral for applicants about the district's policy on nondiscrimination and related complaint procedures. Such notification shall be included in the annual parental notification distributed pursuant to Education Code section 48980 and, as applicable, in announcements, bulletins, catalogs, handbooks, application forms, or other materials distributed by the district. The notification shall also be posted on the district's web site and social media and in district schools and offices, including staff lounges, student government meeting rooms, and other prominent locations as appropriate.

In addition, the annual parental notification shall inform parents/guardians of their children's right to a free public education regardless of immigration status or religious beliefs, including information on educational rights issued by the California Attorney General. Alternatively, such information may be provided through any other cost-effective means determined by the superintendent or designee. (Education Code section 234.7)

The district's nondiscrimination policy and related informational materials shall be published in a format that parents/guardians can understand. In addition, when 15 percent or more of a school's students speak a single primary language other than English, those materials shall be translated into that other language.

Access for Individuals with Disabilities

District programs and facilities, viewed in their entirety, shall be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and any implementing standards and/or regulations. When structural changes to existing district facilities are needed to provide individuals with disabilities access to programs, services, activities, or facilities, the superintendent or designee shall develop a transition plan that sets forth the steps for completing the changes.

The superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district provides appropriate auxiliary aids and services when necessary to afford individuals with disabilities equal opportunity to participate in or enjoy the benefits of a service, program, or activity. These aids and services may include, but are not limited to, qualified interpreters or readers, assistive listening devices, assistive technologies or other modifications to increase accessibility to district and school web sites, notetakers, written materials, taped text, and Braille or large-print materials.

Individuals with disabilities shall notify the superintendent, or designee, or principal if they have a disability that requires special assistance or services. Reasonable notification should be given prior to the school-sponsored function, program, or meeting.

The below individual position is hereby designated as the district's ADA/Title II coordinator. The coordinator shall receive and address requests for accommodation submitted by individuals with disabilities, and shall investigate and resolve complaints regarding their access to district programs, services, activities, or facilities.

# Policy 1312.2: Complaints Concerning Instructional Materials
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Status:** ADOPTED  
**Printed:** 11/13/2023 01:06 PM  

The Governing Board takes great care in the adoption of instructional materials and is aware that all adopted materials may not be acceptable to all students, their parents/guardians, or other district residents.

The Superintendent or designee is directed to implement procedures which will permit proper consideration of any complaints against the use of any instructional materials or library/media materials, including textbooks, supplementary textbooks, library books, and other instructional materials and equipment.

The Board believes the Superintendent or designee is well qualified to consider complaints concerning instructional materials. Complainants are advised to consider and accept the Superintendent or designee's decision as final. However, if the complainant finds the decision of the Superintendent or designee unsatisfactory, he/she may appeal the decision within 30 days of request.

The Board will not allow political party affiliation, racial prejudice, a desire to suppress ideas, or an intent to deny students access to ideas with which the Board disagrees, to influence its decision in any such case.

(cf. 1312.4 - Complaints Concerning Categorical Aid Programs)

The Governing Board uses a comprehensive process to adopt district instructional materials that is based on selection criteria established by law and board policy and includes opportunities for the involvement of district staff, parents/guardians, and community members, and, as appropriate, students. Complaints concerning the content or use of instructional materials, including textbooks, supplementary instructional materials, library materials, or other instructional materials and equipment, shall be properly and fairly considered using established complaint procedures.

Parents/guardians are encouraged to discuss any concerns regarding instructional materials with their child's teacher and/or the school principal. If the situation remains unresolved, a complaint may be filed using the process specified in the accompanying administrative regulation and exhibit.

The district shall accept complaints concerning instructional materials only from staff, district residents, or the parents/guardians of children enrolled in a district school. (Education Code section 35160)

However, a complaint related to the use or prohibited use of any existing textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library that alleges unlawful discrimination based on a violation of Education Code section 243 shall be filed, investigated, and resolved in accordance with Board Policy 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.

When deliberating upon challenged materials, the superintendent, or the designee or committee established by the superintendent to review the materials, shall consider the degree to which the materials aligned with the criteria for instructional materials as specified in law, Board policy, and administrative regulation. In addition, such deliberations may consider the educational philosophy and vision of the district; the educational suitability of the materials including the manner in which the materials support the curriculum and appropriateness for the student's age; the professional opinions of teachers of the subject and of other competent authorities and/or experts; reviews of the materials by reputable bodies; the stated objectives in using the materials; community standards; the allegations in the complaint, including the extent to which the objections are based on the dislike of ideas contained.

![SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SAN+JUAN+UNIFIED+SCHOOL+DISTRICT+BOARD+OF+EDUCATION)

**AGENDA ITEM:** I-6  
**MEETING DATE:** 02/13/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Resolution Reducing or Discontinuing Particular Kinds of Services—TK-12 Certificated  
**DEPARTMENT:** Human Resources  

**CHECK ONE:**  
For Discussion: ☑  
For Action: ☐  
Report: ☐  
Workshop: ☐  
Recognition: ☐  
Emergency Action: ☐  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board discuss the adoption of:  
1. Resolution No. 4116, reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services, and the corresponding amount of certificated staffing that will be reduced as a result (attachment 1).  
2. Resolution No. 4117, establishing criteria to apply to break a tie in seniority for certificated staff affected by program reductions and who have the same date of hire (attachment 2).  

**Action anticipated:** 02/27/2024  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Each year through a comprehensive student needs assessment, all school sites participate in a process to align student needs to site allocations. As the needs and resources (and often enrollment) change, staffing also changes. At the local level, each school site engages staff, students, parents, and educational partners in various ways to determine the most beneficial actions. Through the needs assessment process, the site determines what positions need to be eliminated, reduced, or shifted. The elimination of (or planned elimination of) particular kinds of service (PKS) determines the PKS list.  

The district is committed to building a sustainable budget that aligns resources with the Strategic Plan and Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP). This is addressed through the collective work of our entire community and the district is fortunate to have families, local leaders and employees who recognize and value the importance of public education. Instructional leaders are continually evaluating allocation of resources and program delivery models. To best meet the needs of San Juan Unified School District students, changes to the delivery model for certain services have been recommended for the 2024-25 school year.  

As a result of the need to make changes, certain kinds of services rendered by certificated employees have been identified to be eliminated or reduced. In order to meet statutory notice requirements for potential reassignments or layoffs, the board needs to adopt the two resolutions specified above.  

**ATTACHMENT(S):**  
1. Resolution No. 4116, reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services.  
2. Resolution No. 4117, establishing criteria to apply to break a tie in seniority for certificated staff affected by program reductions and who have the same date of hire.

WHEREAS, the board anticipates that it will be necessary to terminate the services of certificated employees effective at the close of this school year: and,

WHEREAS, this board has determined that as between certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher to the district on the same date, certain criteria should be used in determining the order of termination based upon the needs of the district and the students thereof.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FOUND, ORDERED, AND RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:

1. Each and all of the foregoing recitals are true and correct.

2. The criteria used to determine the order of termination of certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher to the district on the same date, and the weight to be given to such criteria, shall be the following:

### a. Category I – Certifications and Experience

Need: To retain teachers with: greatest flexibility of assignment based on California credentials held; National Board Certification; and/or experience teaching at schools identified as District Designated Title I school.

| Criteria                                                                 | Points |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Each full K-12 base credential (e.g., multiple subject, single subject, pupil personnel services, school nurse, librarian, school social worker) | 4      |
| Each foundational level base credential (If a full base credential is held, must be a different subject area) | 3      |
| Each active intern credential (If a base credential is held, must be a different subject area) | 2      |
| Each supplemental authorization                                            | 2      |
| Other services credential (administration)                                | 2      |

| Each year or portion of a year of in-district experience as a certificated employee under contract prior to the employee’s seniority date | Percentage of school year(s) served     |

3. The order of termination of certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher to the district on the same date as set forth above is based solely on the needs of this district and its students.

4.

5. This resolution shall be for the purpose of determining the relative order of termination of certain certificated employees as part of a layoff of certificated employees effective at the end of the 2023-2024 school year. This resolution shall not be effective for any other purposes, including, but not limited to, order of reemployment offers or any subsequent layoffs of certificated employees.

2. Resolution No. 4121, establishing criteria to apply to break a tie in seniority for adult education certificated staff affected by program reductions and who have the same date of hire (attachment 2).  

Action anticipated: 02/27/2024  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The district is committed to building a sustainable budget that aligns resources with the Strategic Plan and Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP). This is addressed through the collective work of our entire community and the district is fortunate to have families, local leaders and employees who recognize and value the importance of public education. Instructional leaders are continually evaluating allocation of resources and program delivery models. To best meet the needs of San Juan Unified School District adult education students, changes to the delivery model for certain services have been recommended for the 2024-2025 school year.  

As a result of the need to make changes, certain kinds of services rendered by certificated employees have been identified to be eliminated or reduced. In order to meet statutory notice requirements for potential reassignments or layoffs, the board needs to adopt the two resolutions specified above.  

**ATTACHMENT(S):**  
1. Resolution No. 4120, reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services—adult education.  
2. Resolution No. 4121, establishing criteria to apply to break a tie in seniority for adult education certificated staff affected by program reductions and who have the same date of hire.

## RESOLUTION NO. 4121

### BEFORE THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

(Resolution specifying criteria used in determining the order of termination of adult education certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher on the same date)

WHEREAS, the board anticipates that it will be necessary to terminate the services of certificated employees effective at the close of this school year: and

WHEREAS, this board has determined that as between certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher to the district on the same date, certain criteria should be used in determining the order of termination based upon the needs of the district and the students thereof.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FOUND, ORDERED, AND RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:

1. Each and all of the foregoing recitals are true and correct.

2. The criteria used to determine the order of termination of certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher to the district on the same date, and the weight to be given to such criteria, shall be the following:

   a. **Category I – Certifications and Experience**  
   Need: To retain teachers with: greatest flexibility of assignment based on California credentials held.

   | Criteria                                                                 | Points |
   |--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
   | Each full base credential (e.g., designated subject, multiple subject, single subject, pupil personnel services) | 4      |
   | Each supplemental authorization                                            | 2      |
   | Other services credential (administration)                               | 2      |

   If there is still a tie after applying the above criteria, then Category II will be utilized.

   b. **Category II – District Teaching Experience**  
   Need: To recognize certificated experience in the San Juan Unified School District under contract which is not reflected by the employee’s seniority date.

| Experience                                                                 | Value                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Each year or portion of a year of in-district experience as a certificated employee under contract prior to the employee’s seniority date. | Percentage of school year(s) served                 |

If there is still a tie after applying Category II criteria, then Category III will be utilized.

c. Category III - Lottery

If any two or more certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary employee on the same date still have the same number of points after application of points provided above, the ranking of such employees shall be determined by a lottery conducted by the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources or designee.

3. The order of termination of certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher to the district on the same date as set forth above is based solely on the needs of this district and its students.

4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution to the contrary, a certificated employee shall be retained to render any service for which there is no certificated employee retained in the district with a higher number of points, as determined by the procedure set forth above, or with more seniority, who is certificated and competent to render such service.

5. This resolution shall be for the purpose of determining the relative order of termination of certain certificated employees as part of a layoff of certificated employees effective at the end of the 2024-2025 school year. This resolution shall not be effective for any other purposes, including, but not limited to, any subsequent layoffs of certificated employees.

PASSED AND ADOPTED by the Governing Board of the San Juan Unified School District this _______ day of ______________, 2024, by the following vote:

AYES:  
NOES:  
ABSENT:
