# Policy 0420.41: Charter School Oversight
**Status:** ADOPTED  
**Original Adopted Date:** 02/25/2014 | **Last Revised Date:** 10/11/2022 | **Last Reviewed Date:** 10/11/2022

The Governing Board recognizes its ongoing responsibility to oversee any charter school authorized by the board, and to ensure it is successfully fulfilling the terms of its charter and is providing a high-quality educational program for students enrolled in the charter school.

The superintendent or designee shall identify at least one staff member to serve as a contact person for each charter school authorized by the board. (Education Code section 47604.32)

The superintendent or designee shall visit each charter school at least annually and may inspect or observe any part of the charter school at any time. (Education Code sections 47604.32, 47607)

The superintendent or designated charter school contact shall attend meetings of the charter school governing body whenever possible and shall periodically meet with a representative of the charter school.

## Monitoring Charter School Performance

Any charter school authorized by the Board shall be monitored by the Superintendent or designee to determine whether the charter school complies with all legal requirements applicable to charter schools, including all reports required of charter schools by law, as specified in Education Code 47604.32. Any violations of law shall be reported to the Board.

The Board shall monitor each charter school to determine whether it is achieving the measurable student outcomes set forth in the charter, both schoolwide and for each numerically significant student subgroup served by the school as defined in Education Code 52052. This determination shall be based on the measures specified in the approved charter and any applicable MOU, and on the charter school's annual review and assessment of its progress toward the goals and actions identified in its local control and accountability plan (LCAP), as reported in the California School Dashboard.

The Board shall monitor the fiscal condition of the charter school based on any financial report or information obtained from the charter school, including, but not limited to, the charter school's preliminary budget, LCAP and annual update of the charter school's LCAP, first and second interim financial reports, and final unaudited report for the full prior year. (Education Code 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5)
<!-- Page 21 -->
# Waivers

If the charter school wishes to request a general waiver of any state law or regulation applicable to it, it shall request that Board approve and the district submit a general waiver request to the State Board of Education (SBE) on its behalf. Upon approval of the Board, the superintendent or designee shall submit such a waiver request to SBE on behalf of the charter school.

## Provision of District Services

Upon approval by the Board of an appropriate agreement, the charter school may purchase administrative or other services from the district or any other source. (Education Code section 47613)

Whenever the district agrees to provide administrative or support services to a charter school, the district and the charter school shall develop a memorandum of understanding (MOU) which clarifies the financial and operational agreements between them.

At the request of a charter school, the superintendent or designee shall create and submit any reports required by the State Teachers' Retirement System or Public Employees' Retirement System on behalf of the charter school. The district may charge the charter school for the actual costs of the reporting services, but shall not require the charter school to purchase payroll processing services from the district as a condition for creating and submitting the reports. (Education Code section 47611.3)

## Material Revisions to Charter

Material revisions to a charter may only be made with board approval. Material revisions shall be governed by the same standards and criteria that apply to petitions for the authorization of charter schools as set forth in Education Code section 47605 and shall include, but not be limited to, a reasonably comprehensive description of any new requirement of charter schools enacted into law after the charter was originally granted or last renewed. (Education Code section 47607)

If an approved charter school proposes to expand operations to one or more additional sites or grade levels, whether concurrently with or unrelated to a renewal, the charter school shall request a material revision to its charter and shall notify the board of those additional locations or grade levels. The board shall consider approval of the additional locations or grade levels at an open meeting. (Education Code sections 47605, 47607)

The board shall have the authority to determine whether a proposed change in charter school operations constitutes a material revision of the approved charter.

The Board may deny a proposed material revision if it finds that the proposed material revision would render the charter school demonstrably unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community in which the school is located or proposes to locate. In making this finding, the Board shall consider all of the following: (Education Code 47605)
<!-- Page 22 -->
![Attachment 1](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+1)

1. The fiscal impact of the proposed expansion on the district  
2. The extent to which the expansion would substantially undermine existing services, academic offerings, or programmatic offerings  
3. Whether the expansion would duplicate a program currently offered within the district that has sufficient capacity for the students proposed to be served within reasonable proximity to where the charter school intends to locate  

Additionally, the Board may deny a proposed material revision if it finds that the district is not positioned to absorb the fiscal impact of the proposed material revision. The Board shall make this finding if the district has a qualified interim certification pursuant to Education Code 42131 and the County Superintendent of Schools, in consultation with the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, certifies that approving the charter school would result in the district having a negative interim certification pursuant to Education Code 42131, the district has a negative interim certification pursuant to Education Code 42131, or the district is under state receivership. (Education Code 47605)

**Location of Charter Schools**  
Except when permitted to operate outside district boundaries pursuant to Education Code 47605 and 47605.1, a charter school shall be located within district boundaries.

**Monitoring Charter School Performance**  
Any charter school authorized by the board shall be monitored by the superintendent or designee to determine whether the charter school complies with all legal requirements applicable to charter schools, including all reports required of charter schools by law, as specified in Education Code section 47604.32. Any violations of law shall be reported to the board.

The Board shall monitor each charter school to determine whether it is achieving the measurable student outcomes set forth in the charter, both schoolwide and for each numerically significant student subgroup served by the school as defined in Education Code section 52052. This determination shall be based on the measures specified in the approved charter and any applicable MOU, and on the charter school’s annual review and assessment of its progress toward the goals and actions identified in its local control and accountability plan (LCAP), as reported in the California School Dashboard.

The board shall monitor the fiscal condition of the charter school based on any financial report or information obtained from the charter school, including, but not limited to, the charter school’s preliminary budget, LCAP and annual update of the charter school’s LCAP, first and second interim financial reports, and final unaudited report for the full prior year. (Education Code sections 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5)
<!-- Page 23 -->
# Fees/Charges for Supervisorial Oversight

The district may charge for district supervisorial oversight as follows: (Education Code 47613; 5 CCR 11969.7)

1. Actual costs up to one percent of the charter school's revenue **if the district provides the charter school with facilities under Education Code 47614 and charges the charter school a pro-rata share of the facilities cost.**

2. Actual costs up to three percent of the charter school's revenue **if the district provides the charter school substantially rent-free facilities. If the district provides the charter school with facilities under Education Code 47614 and charges the charter school a pro-rata share of the facilities costs calculated pursuant to 5 CCR 11969.7, the district may only charge the charter school for the actual costs of supervisorial oversight up to one percent of the charter school's revenue.**

3. Actual costs if the district is assigned supervisorial oversight responsibility for the charter school by SBE when authorized on appeal.

## Technical Assistance/Intervention

Whenever a charter school is identified for technical assistance based on the performance of one or more numerically significant student subgroups on SBE-established criteria, the charter school shall receive technical assistance from the County Superintendent of Schools. Such technical assistance shall be focused on building the charter school's capacity to develop and implement actions and services responsive to student and community needs, including, but not limited to, any of the following: (Education Code section 47607.3)

1. Assisting the charter school to identify its strengths and weaknesses in regard to the state priorities applicable to the charter school pursuant to Education Code section 47605. This shall include working collaboratively with the charter school to review performance data on the state and local indicators included in the California School Dashboard and other relevant local data and to identify effective, evidence-based programs or practices that address any areas of weakness.

2. Working collaboratively with the charter school to secure assistance from an academic, programmatic, or fiscal expert or team of experts to identify and implement effective programs and practices that are designed to improve performance in any areas of weakness identified by the charter school. Another service provider, including, but not limited to, a school district, county office of education, or charter school, may be solicited to act as a partner to the charter school in need of technical assistance.

3. Obtaining from the charter school timely documentation demonstrating that it has completed the activities described in Items #1 and 2 or substantially similar activities or has selected another service provider to work with the charter school to complete the activities described in Items #1 and 2 or substantially similar activities, and ongoing communication with the Board to assess the charter school's progress in improving student outcomes.

In addition, if, in three out of four consecutive school years, a charter school fails to improve outcomes for three or more numerically significant student subgroups, or for all of the student
<!-- Page 24 -->
![Attachment 1](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+1)

subgroups if the school has fewer than three subgroups, in regard to one or more state or school priorities identified in the charter, the County Superintendent may request that the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI), with SBE approval, assign the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to provide advice and assistance to the charter school pursuant to Education Code section 52074. (Education Code sections 47607.3; 52072)

In accordance with law, the board may deny a charter school's renewal petition or may revoke a charter based on the charter school's poor performance, especially with regard to inadequate academic achievement of all numerically significant subgroups of students served by the charter school. (Education Code 47607, 47607.2)

## Complaints

Each charter school shall establish and maintain policies and procedures in accordance with the uniform complaint procedures as specified in 5 CCR 4600-4670 to enable any person alleging the school's noncompliance with Education Code sections 47606.5 or 47607.3 to file a complaint with the charter school. (Education Code section 52075)

A complaint may be filed anonymously if the complaint provides evidence or information leading to evidence to support an allegation of noncompliance. A complainant who is not satisfied with the decision may appeal the decision to the SPI. (Education Code section 52075)

If the charter school finds merit in the complaint or the SPI finds merit in an appeal, a remedy shall be provided to all affected students and parents/guardians. (Education Code section 52075)

## School Closure

In the event that the Board revokes or denies renewal of a charter or the charter school ceases operation for any reason, the superintendent or designee shall, when applicable in accordance with the charter and/or a memorandum of understanding, provide assistance to facilitate the transfer of the charter school's former students and to finalize financial reporting and close-out of the charter school.

The superintendent or designee shall provide notification to the California Department of Education, within 10 calendar days of the board's action, if renewal of a charter is denied, a charter is revoked, or a charter school will cease operation for any reason.

Such notification shall include, but not be limited to, a description of the circumstances of the closure, the effective date of the closure, and the location of student and personnel records. (Education Code sections 47604.32; 5 CCR 11962.1)

# PRODUCT
## SAN JUAN UNIFIED LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

We deeply respect their ongoing connection to this land and recognize their resilience in preserving and revitalizing their cultures and traditions despite historical and ongoing challenges.

We recognize the profound injustices endured by their ancestors, including genocide, forced assimilation, and displacement, and we remain aware of the ongoing challenges and injustices they face today. As we advance in our commitment to equity and inclusion, we pledge to strengthen our connections by fostering a culture of understanding, respect, and active collaboration with their communities.

## AGENDA ITEM: J.2  
### BOARD OF EDUCATION  
#### MEETING DATE: 10/22/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: Visions In Education Charter School Renewal Petition (Oaxaca) - 7:40 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Public Hearing/Discussion: The superintendent is recommending that the board hold a public hearing and discuss the Visions In Education charter renewal petition. The term for this charter will expire on June 30, 2026, unless approved for renewal by the Board of Education. Action anticipated: December 17, 2024.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Visions In Education Charter School has operated in San Juan Unified as an independent district charter since 2017. Visions In Education Charter School provides an independent study model to meet the needs of students in grades transitional kindergarten through 12th grade.  

The district’s Charter Review Team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and Visions In Education has provided all necessary information requested during the review process. The Visions In Education Charter Renewal Petition presented to the Board of Education is in compliance with district Board Policy 0420.4 Charter Schools, and current law. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreement will continue to define the specific financial and operational relationship between Visions In Education and the district and resolve other matters of mutual interest not otherwise contained within the terms of the charter petition. It is the intent of the MOU that Visions In Education not be a fiscal burden to the district.  

In order to recommend the approval of a charter school renewal to the Board of Education, San Juan Unified staff must determine that the charter school has met the requirements set forth in the Education Code, section 47605. For clarity, these requirements have been organized into the following four renewal criteria, outlined in this section.  
I. Has the charter school presented a sound educational program?  
II. Is the charter school demonstrably likely to successfully implement the proposed educational program?  
III. Is the petition reasonably comprehensive?  
IV. Is the charter school serving all students who wish to attend?  

A copy of the charter petition is available for review in the superintendent's office and at the San Juan Central enrollment office.

**Introduction to Visions**  
**Founded:** 1999  

**Vision:** Preparing each student to succeed in a rapidly changing world.  

**Mission Statement:** As an independent study/home school program, Visions In Education utilizes a standards-based education that addresses individual differences and learning styles. We empower students to take ownership and responsibility for their present and future learning by developing their academic, social-emotional, postsecondary, and technological skills.

**Who We Are**  
**Serving students where they live. Accessing the resources that are in their own backyard.**  

We are 510+ staff serving nearly 7,500+ students across nine counties in three independent study academies:  
- Home School Academy & Online Middle School  
- Independent Study Academy & Credit Recovery Program  
- University Prep Academy Early College

<!-- Page 57 -->
![Our Programs At-A-Glance](https://via.placeholder.com/1024x768.png?text=Our+Programs+At-A-Glance)

**Our Programs At-A-Glance**

- **Home School (HS)** (Grades TK-8)  
  Families collaborate with credentialed teachers to choose core curriculum, resources, and enrichment activities. Credentialed teachers provide ongoing support, monitor progress, and work closely with parents to ensure students achieve academic goals.

- **Online Middle School (OMS)** (Grades 7-8)  
  Students follow structured schedules and receive direct instruction from credentialed teachers in a virtual setting. They are required to participate in live, synchronous instruction sessions for core academic subjects.

- **Independent Study (IS)** (Grades 9-12)  
  Students complete coursework using an online learning system on a flexible schedule. They meet one-on-one with a credentialed teacher to track progress toward graduation and may participate in live, synchronous instruction in core academic areas.

- **Credit Recovery** (Grades 10-12)  
  Students identified as "credit deficient" use an online learning system to follow an individually tailored course of study. They meet one-on-one with a credentialed teacher and receive targeted support to help them recover credits and stay on track for graduation.

- **University Prep Early College (UP)** (Grades 9-12)  
  Students use an online learning system to complete college-preparatory courses, with mandatory live, synchronous instruction for core subjects. They may also participate in Dual Enrollment, with the option to earn an AA degree alongside their diploma.

## BOARD OF EDUCATION  
### AGENDA ITEM: J.3  
### MEETING DATE: 10/22/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Cellphone Policy (Allen) - 7:50 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Administration  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Report: The superintendent is recommending that the board receive a report regarding cellphone restriction policies and practices.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
In response to interest by the Board of Education and recent legislation, staff have undertaken a review of cellphone restriction policies and practices.  

AB 3216 was signed by Governor Newsom in September 2024. It requires that all local education agencies develop and approve a policy restricting student cellphone use. The bill specifies that the policy is to be developed with significant engagement of students, parents/guardians, staff and community members with implementation occurring no later than July 1, 2026, and updates every five years. The bill also affirms existing law that would limit when cellphone restrictions can be put in place.  

Current Board Policy 5131 on student conduct specifies that cellphones and other devices are to be turned off during class time. Implementation of this policy currently varies based on the needs and instructional practice of schools and classrooms.  

Research on the benefits of limiting cellphone access finds mixed results when looking at improvements to academic outcomes with indicators that the impacts may vary between different groups of students. Both research and surveys of practitioners find that restrictions have the potential to positively impact both classroom behaviors and overall safety.  

San Juan Unified will utilize a comprehensive engagement strategy to collect voice on potential modifications to the district's policy before returning this spring with a recommendation for board consideration.

![Churchill Middle School Cell Phone Policy](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Churchill+Middle+School+Cell+Phone+Policy)

**Rationale**  
When used appropriately, cell phones can support student learning. Teachers and students use cell phones to answer surveys, read, check for understanding, keep a calendar, take photos of notes, look up information, perform calculations, etc.

However, there are times when cell phones have no purpose in class or on campus. Assessments and laboratory activities are examples of when cell phones should remain silent and out of sight. Our new 2024-25 PBIS Cell Phone policy is designed to reflect this complexity. There will be three “ZONES” for cell phone use:

**GREEN ZONE**  
In the GREEN ZONE, students have permission to use their electronic devices appropriately. These areas include the outside main quad and cafeteria during lunch. Taking photos and/or making videos of ourselves or others is not acceptable under any circumstance.

**YELLOW ZONE**  
Teachers can designate their classrooms a YELLOW ZONE when they want to allow cell phone use during class time for educational purposes. Students are expected to use their phones as directed. Appropriate use of phones during class time may include surveys, reading, research, keeping a calendar of assignments, etc.

**RED ZONE**  
In the RED ZONE, cell phone use is not allowed and phones are expected to remain silent and out-of-sight. Locker rooms, restrooms, inside and outside hallways are a RED ZONE at all times. In a RED ZONE, students must have devices, cell phones, and air pods or headphones away and out of sight. Students not able to demonstrate acceptable device management in a RED ZONE will work with our administration team to take corrective action. Parents and guardians will be notified if a student does not demonstrate acceptable behavior in a RED ZONE.

The Governing Board recognizes that the use of smartphones and other mobile communication devices on campus may be beneficial to student learning and well-being, but could be disruptive of the instructional program in some circumstances. The Board permits limited use of mobile communication devices on campus in accordance with law and the following policy.

Students may use cell phones, smart watches, pagers, or other mobile communication devices on campus during noninstructional time as long as the device is utilized in accordance with law and any rules that individual school sites may impose.

1. In the case of an emergency, or in response to a perceived threat of danger  
2. When a teacher or administrator grants permission to the student to possess or use a mobile communication device, subject to any reasonable limitation imposed by that teacher or administrator  
3. When a licensed physician or surgeon determines that the possession or use is necessary for the student's health and well-being  
4. When the possession or use is required by the student's individualized education program  

Smartphones and other mobile communication devices shall not be used in any manner which infringes on the privacy rights of any other person.

### A Story of the Oregon Trail
#### by James Otis

Susan rode with me, as she had from the beginning of the journey. Nothing of note happened to us, unless I should set down that this day was stormy, and on that day the sun shone, until we came into the valley of the North Fork of the Platte, through a pass which is known as Ash Hollow.

There we drove down a dry ravine on our winding way to the river bottoms, stopping now and then to gather a store of wild currants and gooseberries which grew in abundance.

Near the mouth of the ravine we came upon a small log cabin, which had evidently been built by trappers, but the emigrants on their way into the Oregon country had converted it into a post office, by sticking here and there, in the crevices of the logs, letters to be forwarded to their friends in the States. Hung on the wall where all might see it, was a general notice requesting any who passed on their way to the Missouri River to take these missives, and deposit them in the nearest regular post office.

The little cabin had an odd appearance, and Susan confessed that, almost for the first time since leaving Independence, she was growing homesick, solely because of seeing this post office.

After crossing the stream we came upon a party of emigrants from Ohio, having only four wagons drawn by ten yoke of oxen, and driving six cows.

Truly it was a small company to set out on so long a march, and when the leader begged that they be allowed to join us, I could not object, understanding that unless these strangers had someone of experience to guide them, the chances were strongly against their arriving at the Columbia River.

There was in the company a girl of about Susan's age, whose name was Mary Parker, and from that time I had two companions as I rode in advance of the train.

I could have found no fault with these new members of our company, for they obeyed my orders without question from the oldest man to the youngest child.

Mary Parker was a companionable girl, and she and Susan often cheered me on the long way, for even when the rain was coming down in torrents, drenching them to the skin, they rode by my side, laughing and singing.

On the twenty-fourth day of June we arrived at Fort Laramie, in the midst of a heavy storm. We had traveled six hundred sixty-seven miles since leaving Independence, if our course had been the most direct; but allowing for the distances some of us had ridden in search of cattle or here and there off the trail looking for a camping place it must have been that we made at least a hundred miles more.

Fort Laramie is on the west side of a stream known as Laramie's Fork and about two miles from the Platte River. It is a trading post belonging to the North American Fur Company, and built of adobe, by which I mean sun dried bricks, with walls not less than two feet thick and twelve or fourteen feet high.

This fort, if it can be called such, is simply a wall enclosing an open square of twenty-five yards each way, along the sides of which are the dwellings, storerooms, blacksmith shops, carpenter shops, and offices all fronting inside, while from the outside can be seen only two gates, one of which faces the north and the other the south.

Just south of the fort is a wall enclosing about an acre of land, which is used as a stable or corral, while a short distance farther on is a cultivated field, the scanty crops of which give good evidence that the soil is not suitable for farming.

About a mile below Fort Laramie, and having much the same appearance as that fortification, although not so large, is Fort John, which is in possession of the St. Louis Fur Company.

We were given quarters inside Fort Laramie, which was much to our liking.

Then, when we set off once more, it was with greater cheerfulness and increased hope, for the way could not have been improved nor made more pleasant.

Ten days after we celebrated the independence of this country we encamped near the Narrows, within sight of the snow-capped Wind River Mountains, and then it was that our company got some idea of what a herd of buffaloes looked like.

When we broke camp in the morning it seemed as if the entire land was covered with the animals. They were in such throngs that the sound of their hoofs was like the rumbling of distant thunder.

One could compare the scene to nothing more than to an ocean of dark water surrounding us on every side, pitching and tossing as if under the influence of a strong wind.

It was such a sight as I had seen more than once, but to my companions it was terrifying at the same time that it commanded their closest attention.

**Sample Question**

This question has two parts. First answer part A. Then, answer part B.

**Part A**  
What inference can be made about the travelers' feelings toward their stay at Fort Laramie?  
(A) They were glad for their time at Fort Laramie.  
(B) They felt overwhelmed by the size of Fort Laramie.  
(C) They felt humbled by the condition of Fort Laramie.  
(D) They were cautious about staying in Fort Laramie.  

**Part B**  
Which sentences from the text best supports your answer in part A?  
(A) Fort Laramie is on the west side of a stream known as Laramie's Fork and about two miles from the Platte River. It is a trading post belonging to the North American Fur Company, and built of adobe, by which I mean sun dried bricks, with walls not less than two feet thick and twelve or fourteen feet high.  
(B) Just south of the fort is a wall enclosing about an acre of land, which is used as a stable or corral, while a short distance farther on is a cultivated field, the scanty crops of which give good evidence that the soil is not suitable for farming.  
(C) About a mile below Fort Laramie, and having much the same appearance as that fortification, although not so large, is Fort John, which is in possession of the St. Louis Fur Company. We were given quarters inside Fort Laramie, which was much to our liking.

# Grade 8 ELA Math Performance Task

## Stacks of Cups

Your science classroom uses cups for many experiments. Your teacher ordered lots of cups from a catalog. The catalog is not very good. It has the following picture, but no other useful information.

Your teacher wants you to help her get organized for when the cups arrive next week. Using only the information shown in the picture, she asks you to figure out some other specific measurements.

1. How tall, in cm, is the stack of 8 cups?  
   __________ cm

2. How tall, in cm, is 1 cup? Explain how you determined the height of 1 cup.  
   __________

3. Your teacher thinks that instead of having to figure out these stacks each time, it would be useful to understand the general relationship.  
   Write an equation expressing the relationship between the height of the stack and the number of cups in the stack.  
   Let h represent the height of the stack, in cm, and n the number of cups in the stack.  
   __________

4  
The catalog is advertising a stack of these cups that is 95 cm tall. Lori says, "That must be a misprint because a stack of that height is not possible."  
Do you agree or disagree with Lori? Explain your reasoning.

5  
Your class wants to sell School Spirit Cups with your school logo on them. Your teacher wants you to design this new cup such that a stack of 10 cups will be 125 cm tall.  
Describe key measurements of the School Spirit Cups and explain how they will meet the required specifications.
