Amending District Graduation Requirements for the Class of 2024 (K-1)  
Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Education and Programs Kristan Schnepp gave a presentation regarding amending the district’s graduation requirements for the Class of 2024. Ms. Schnepp provided historical context, noting that in 2016 the board approved increasing graduation requirements starting with the Class of 2023, which included additional courses in mathematics, science, and world language; however, with school closures occurring due to COVID-19, the disruption to students’ education has impacted many of the current seniors and there is no state legislation to support the Class of 2024. Ms. Schnepp said that staff reviewed current data for seniors and gathered input from staff, students, and the community, and ultimately determined that there was a need to reduce the number of credits needed to graduate. Ms. Schnepp explained that the recommended graduation requirement for the Class of 2024 is 160 credits. Staff answered questions from the board. Board members made comments and posed questions regarding the block versus traditional schedules, the graduation advisory committee, the timing of the recommendation, current data and credit recovery options, acknowledging that it may take some time to get back to the board-adopted graduation requirements that were approved in 2016. After board discussion, it was agreed that the item would return for action as a business item on January 9.

2023-2024 First Interim and Budget/Financial Status Report (K-2)  
Interim Chief Financial Officer Lisa Grant-Dawson and Director of Fiscal Services Kristi Blandford presented the 2023-2024 First Interim Report, certifying the First Interim Report as positive, with the understanding of the fiduciary responsibility to maintain fiscal solvency for the current and subsequent two fiscal years. The First Interim Report reflects the anticipated revenues and expenditures through October 31, 20223, forecasts the remaining 2022-2023 fiscal year, and provides a multi-year budget projection for years 2024-2025 and 2025-2026. Board members made comments and expressed appreciation for the positive certification. It was moved by Ms. Villescaz, seconded by Mr. Perez, to approve the 2023-2024 First Interim Report with the positive certification of the district’s ability to meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year and subsequent two fiscal years. MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY [Costa, Hernandez, Avey, Villescaz, Kravchuk, Perez, Creason].

2022-2023 Audit Report (K-3)  
Ms. Blandford shared that the completion of the 2022-2023 audit report is delayed because the district submitted a request for an extension to file the Annual Audit and Financial Statements with the California Department of Education (CDE). Ms. Blandford explained that the district previously filed a J-13A waiver form with the CDE for lost attendance days at Barrett Middle School and Grand Oaks Elementary School in January 2023 due to severe storms in the region; however, the CDE currently has more than 600 forms pending approval, and the district’s waiver has not yet been approved. Ms. Blandford conveyed that the district’s external audit firm, Crowe LLP, will provide a final audit report once the waiver is approved, which the anticipated timeframe is between December 2023 and March 2024.

Issuance and Sale of General Obligation Bonds (K-4)  
Chief Operations Officer Frank Camarda presented information regarding the proposed issuance and sale of Measure P general obligation bonds to fund capital projects previously authorized by voters. Mr. Camarda answered a clarifying question, which Mr. Camarda answered. It was moved by Ms. Villescaz, seconded by Mr. Avey, to adopt Resolution No. 4109, authorizing the issuance and sale of general obligation bonds, election of 2016, series 2024, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $125,000,000 and approving related documents and actions. MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY [Costa, Hernandez, Avey, Villescaz, Kravchuk, Perez, Creason].

Advance Refunding of General Obligation Bonds (K-5)  
Mr. Camarda presented the item. It was moved by Mr. Hernandez, seconded by Ms. Creason, to adopt Resolution No. 4110, authorizing the issuance and sale of 2024 general obligation bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $120,000,000 to refund outstanding general obligation refunding bonds and approving related documents and actions. MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY [Costa, Hernandez, Avey, Villescaz, Kravchuk, Perez, Creason].

**Current State Employees (Pub. Contract Code §10410):**

**LABOR CODE/WORKERS' COMPENSATION:** Contractor needs to be aware of the provisions which require every employer to be insured against liability for Worker's Compensation or to undertake self-insurance in accordance with the provisions, and Contractor affirms to comply with such provisions before commencing the performance of the work of this Agreement.

Both domestic and foreign corporations (those incorporated outside of California) must be in good standing in order to be qualified to do business in California. Agencies will determine whether a corporation is in good standing by calling the Office of the Secretary of State.

![AGREEMENT FOR UNDERWRITER SERVICES](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=AGREEMENT+FOR+UNDERWRITER+SERVICES)

This document will serve as an underwriter services agreement (the “Agreement”) between the San Juan Unified School District and any political subdivision created on its behalf (the “District”) and Raymond James & Associates, Inc. (“Raymond James”) and Stifel Nicolaus & Co. (“Stifel”) (Raymond James and Stifel collectively referred to as the “Underwriters”). The District deems it in its best interest to engage and retain the Underwriters, as qualified underwriting firms for the issuance of various type of Securities such as General Obligation Bonds, Certificates of Participation/Leases, Tax and Revenue Anticipation Notes and any other financing vehicles deemed permitted by prevailing federal and state laws (“Securities, Bond(s), GO Bonds, COPS or TRANS.”)

During the term of this Agreement, in our capacity as Underwriters, Raymond James and Stifel proposes to undertake certain activities, including, as appropriate, the following:

**Services to be Provided**

(a) Advising District as to the form and structure of the Bonds and prevailing interest rates and market conditions for comparable securities.

(b) Assisting in the preparation of a Public Offering Memorandum or other applicable information and offering material (the “Memorandum”). Responsibility for the contents of such Memorandum shall be solely that of District and any issuer of the Bonds.

(c) Reviewing all related Bond documents.

(d) Managing, structuring, arranging for and participating in all discussions with nationally recognized rating agencies for obtaining ratings on the Bonds, if appropriate.

(e) Assisting in presentations to potential issuers.

(f) Marketing and underwriting the Bonds.

(g) Submitting a Bond Purchase Contract for the purchase of the Bonds, subject to internal approvals as described below.

**Compensation and Underwriting Percentage**

1) The Underwriters shall be engaged as the District's underwriters for a negotiated sale of the Bonds. As the District's underwriter, the Underwriter shall be paid in the form of a discount on each series of the Bonds sold and delivered. Compensation to the Underwriter is contingent on the issuance of the Bonds. If the bond election is unsuccessful or if the Bonds are never issued, no compensation is due to the Underwriter. Further, as Bonds are sold Raymond James will serve as the bookrunner and be allocated 70% liability and Stifel will be allocated 30% liability designations as “group net” of any part amounts of Bonds issued on each transaction whereby the Underwriters will provide underwriting services. Commencing with the first issuance of bonds of an Election of 2024 general obligation bond measure authorization or the next general obligation bond measure authorization (collectively, “Future Bond Authorization”), Raymond James will serve as the bookrunner and be allocated 60% liability and Stifel will be allocated 40%.
<!-- Page 67 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  

liability designations as “group net” of any par amounts of Future Bond Authorization issued on each transaction whereby the Underwriters will provide underwriting services.

The underwriting commission will be determined based on the principal amount and structure of each series of bonds, exclusive of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Underwriters.

2) In addition, District agrees to pay Underwriters’ out-of-pocket expenses, which shall include, but not be limited to, travel, delivery and similar charges and fees and expenses of underwriter’s legal counsel. The District will also be responsible for all fees, costs and expenses payable to third parties including by way of example but not limitation, District’s and/or issuer’s counsel, any other attorneys, bond counsel, financial advisor, auditors, feasibility consultants, printers, rating agencies and bond trustee.

General Provisions

1) The District understands that the consummation of the transaction will be based upon, among other things, the truth, accuracy and completeness of the information included in the Memorandum or otherwise provided to Underwriters. The District agrees that all such information will be true, correct and complete, and that it will update such information during the course of the underwriting, as appropriate, and that all projections provided to the Underwriters will have been prepared in good faith and based upon reasonable assumptions. The District acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters will rely upon such information and projections without independent verification. Any bond purchase agreement entered into between the Underwriters and District will contain customary indemnification and contribution provisions to indemnify the Underwriters and their affiliates and their officers, directors, employees and any person controlling any of the foregoing.

2) District acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement does not constitute a guarantee by the Underwriters to underwrite the Bonds. It is understood that the Underwriters’ obligations under this Agreement are to use reasonable efforts throughout the term of this Agreement to perform the services described herein. The District acknowledges and agrees that the Underwriters are being retained to act solely as underwriter for the Bonds, and not as an agent or advisor, and that this Agreement is not intended to confer rights or benefits on any member, affiliate, shareholder or creditor of District or any other person or entity or to provide District or any other person with any assurances that the transaction will be consummated. The Underwriters shall act as an independent contractor under this Agreement, and not in any other capacity, including as a fiduciary. The Underwriters will enter into a definitive agreement to underwrite the Bonds if and only if the security, structure, disclosure and other aspects of the issue are satisfactory in all respects to the Underwriters. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the approval of the Underwriters management and its appropriate internal credit committee(s), based upon independent internal credit review and analysis of the Bonds and the Financing, will be required for the Underwriters to serve as investment banker and underwriters for the Bonds. The District acknowledges and agrees that if either the Underwriters management or the appropriate Underwriter internal credit committee does not approve such underwriting, the Underwriters’ obligations under this Agreement will terminate immediately, with no liability to the Underwriters. Upon such termination District shall be obligated to pay any unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses described above.
<!-- Page 68 -->
3) You should be aware that the Underwriters or their affiliates may have trading and other business relationships with other participants in the proposed transaction, including with potential purchasers of the Bonds. These relationships include, but may not be limited to, trading lines, frequent purchases and sales of securities and other engagements through which the Underwriters may have, among other things, an economic interest. In addition, you should be aware that the primary role of an underwriter is to purchase, or arrange for the placement of, securities in an arm’s-length commercial transaction between the issuer and the underwriters and that the Underwriters have financial and other interests that differ from those of the District. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Underwriters will not receive any compensation with respect to the Bonds other than as disclosed above or otherwise disclosed to District. The Underwriters are involved in a wide range of activities from which conflicting interests or duties may arise. Information which is held elsewhere within each of the Underwriters, but of which none of the Underwriters’ personnel involved in the proposed transaction actually has knowledge, will not for any purpose be taken into account in determining the Underwriters’ responsibilities to you.

4) This Agreement will become effective upon its acceptance by District and shall remain in effect unless terminated by either party.

5) The District may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon 30 days’ written notice without liability to District except that Either Underwriter shall be entitled to the prompt payment of any unreimbursed out-of-pocket expenses described above, and District shall remain obligated to each Underwriter as provided in paragraph 2 of the Compensation section above.

6) No opinion or advice of the Underwriters shall be reproduced, disseminated, quoted or referred to at any time without the prior written consent of each Underwriter. Upon the completion of the financing, we will be entitled to advertise the transaction in publications and at times selected by us at our own expense.

7) No waiver, amendment or other modification of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by each party hereto.

8) Any dispute between the parties hereto concerning or arising under this Agreement shall be resolved by arbitration under the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE UNDER THE LAW EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL IN RESOLVING ANY SUCH DISPUTE.

We look forward to working with you and other members of your financing team on this important assignment.

# Innovative School Communication Plan

## Background
San Juan Unified School District has a history of creating themed or programmatically focused schools to meet the needs and interests of students, families, and staff members. In 2017, the district created Meraki High School after a design process charged with recreating the secondary education experience for the modern learner. Similarly, the district launched an effort to reimagine what was possible in elementary education and launched an innovative school effort seeking to create a new learning experience at an elementary or K-8 school in the district.

In the 2022-23 school year, Woodside K-8 was selected to be the home of the district’s innovative school program, with development work happening in the 2023-24 school year prior to the full launch in 2024-25.

The selection of Woodside K-8 was made after an extensive process that included
- Creation of an innovative team of teacher practitioners to engage staff and community members in developing a program based on the selected school’s needs.
- 18 community meetings offering site staff, family members, and others the opportunity to share their hopes and needs for their school.
- A review of enrollment, attendance, and demographic data of each school, consideration of levels of community support available at each school, and consideration of school facilities.
<!-- Page 84 -->
![School staff, supported by the innovative school team, have begun to develop an educational model that embraces innovation itself rather than settling on a specific theme or educational model with the intent of continually ideating, prototyping and refining practices as the needs of students, families and staff members change over time. The design process will focus on three key areas:](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993)

- **SELF - Belonging & Wellness**
- **BETWEEN - Experiential Learning**
- **BEYOND - Leadership and Connection.**

The school staff, innovative schools team, and the sponsorship team seek assistance in clearly communicating the program’s opportunities with key audiences.

### Research

Woodside currently has 400 students enrolled at the school, down from 484 students in the 2018-19 school year. Additionally, 137 students currently transfer/open enroll into Woodside, while 214 students open enroll out of the Woodside attendance area and into another San Juan Unified school.

The school serves a diverse population of students and families, with 14% of its population speaking Spanish, 2.75% speaking Russian, and 2.25% speaking Ukrainian.

Woodside’s student attendance rate in the 2022-23 school year was 91.16%, and the chronic absenteeism rate was 32.5%.

The **2023 district climate survey** found that:
- 69.23% of participating Woodside staff would recommend their school to other families, 68.8% of participating Woodside parents would recommend their school to other families, while only 42.94% of participating Woodside students would recommend their school.
  - Woodside’s percentages are lower than the district average. Districtwide, 77.34% of staff would recommend their school to families, while 81.31% of parents and 60.34% of students would recommend their school.
  - Lichen K-8, another K-8 school in Citrus Heights, had 79.31% of staff recommending their school to families, while 71.48% of parents and 47.13% of students would recommend their school. Woodside’s percentages are lower than Lichen K-8 responses.
<!-- Page 85 -->
- Only 53.37% of participating students are interested in what they are learning, and only 47.24% of students feel that they have access to classes and activities that meet their interests and talents. Similarly, 77.17% of participating parents think students are interested in what they’re learning, and 68.25% think students have access to classes and activities that meet their interests and talents.
  - Districtwide, 53.04% of students are interested in what they’re learning (similar to Woodside students), and 56.76% say they have access to classes and activities that meet their interests (higher than Woodside students).
  - Districtwide, 80.66% of parents think students are interested in what they’re learning (higher than Woodside parents), and 79% think students have access to classes and activities that meet their interests (higher than Woodside parents).
  - At Lichen K-8, 48.84% of students are interested in what they’re learning (lower than Woodside students), and 20.93% say that they have access to classes and activities that meet their interests (lower than Woodside students).
  - At Lichen K-8, 78.08% of parents say students are interested in what they’re learning (similar to Woodside parents), and 77.10% say that they have access to classes and activities that meet their interests (higher than Woodside parents).

- Only 39.38% of participating students feel that the school seeks input when making important decisions, while 61.42% of participating parents and 92.31% of staff felt that way.
  - In 2022, 53.2% of Woodside parents indicated that the school seeks input, and 92.3% of staff felt that way. Students were not asked in 2022.
  - Districtwide, 46.96% of students felt that their school seeks input when making decisions (higher than Woodside), while 71.84% of parents felt that way (higher than Woodside) and 81.18% of staff (lower than Woodside).
  - At Lichen K-8, 55.81% of students felt that their school seeks input when making decisions (higher than Woodside), while 77.22% of parents felt that way (higher than Woodside) and 96.55% of staff feel that way (higher than Woodside).

In the 2022-23 school year, 125 volunteer applications were received for Woodside, 117 of which were parents/guardians or family members, and seven were community members. Of the 125 applications, 100 were completed and approved. Currently, no active volunteers are in classrooms, but volunteers have signed up to help with special events (usually through the PTO) and field trips.

Woodside is currently partnering with Heights Church, Project Optimism, and SAYS. The school also has ties with Foundations Church (usually through donations).

BOARD OF EDUCATION  

AGENDA ITEM: J-2  
MEETING DATE: 01/09/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Amending District Graduation Requirements for the Class of 2024  
**DEPARTMENT:** Division of Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the district’s graduation requirements for the Class of 2024 due to the disruption in education caused by COVID-19. This recommendation is for the 2023-2024 school year.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
In 2016 the board approved to increase graduation requirements starting with the Class of 2023. The increased graduation requirements project included a plan to communicate the new requirements to family, students, and the community as well as a plan to support students with a tiered approach to meeting the increased requirements. These increased requirements included additional courses in mathematics, science, and world language; however, with school closures occurring due to COVID-19, the disruption to students’ education has impacted many of our current seniors. In order to mitigate these hardships, California built in support for the Classes of 2021 and 2022 by adopting Assembly Bill 104 (AB 104) which reverted to the state minimum graduation requirement of 130 credits. Additionally, the board approved amended graduation requirements for the Class of 2023.

# Policy 3430: Investing

**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992 | **Last Revised Date:** 02/15/2022 | **Last Reviewed Date:** 01/10/2023

## Investing

The superintendent or designee may invest as permitted by law all or part of the special reserve fund of the district or any surplus monies not required for the immediate necessities of the district. Such investments must be made with care, skill, prudence and diligence. (Education Code section 41015; Government Code sections 16430, 53601, 53609, 53635)

The Governing Board recognizes that the district's chief fiscal officer has fiduciary responsibility for any funds invested outside the county treasury and is subject to prudent investor standards for investment decisions. As such, the chief fiscal officer shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the prevailing circumstances, including but not limited to the general economic conditions and the anticipated needs of the district. The investment objectives shall be to first safeguard the principal of the funds, then to meet the district's liquidity needs and, third, to achieve a return on the funds. (Government Code sections 53600.3, 53600.5) County treasury investment reports shall be shared with the board quarterly. Reports of funds invested outside the county treasury shall be provided to the board monthly.

The board recognizes the importance of overseeing investments made with district funds, including investments by the county treasurer. The superintendent or designee shall maintain ongoing communication with any county committee established for the purpose of overseeing county investments. In addition, the superintendent or designee shall keep the board informed about county policies that guide the investment of these funds.

The superintendent or designee may annually provide to the board and any oversight committee a statement of the district's investment policy which the board shall consider at a public meeting. Any changes in the policy shall also be considered by the board at a public meeting. In accordance with law and administrative regulations, the superintendent or designee may also provide the board quarterly reports with specified components, including a statement of how the district portfolio compares with the district's investment policy. (Government Code section 53646)

## Debt Management

This debt policy sets forth a set of comprehensive guidelines for short-term and long-term debt. It is the objective of this policy to incorporate the new Local Debt Policy requirements of Government Code section 8855(i) into the district's previously existing policy.

The district's capital planning goals and objectives (Government Code section 8855(i)(1)(D)) are as follows:

1. The district shall obtain financing only when necessary or desirable as determined by the Board of Education.
2. The district will identify the appropriate timing and amount of debt or other financing needs as required.
3. The district will pursue efficient debt issuance strategies and obtain favorable interest rates and other costs in issuing the debt.

The superintendent or designee, chief financial officer, and director of accounting will have the primary responsibility for developing financing recommendations and ensuring the implementation of this debt policy. The responsibilities include:

1. Reviewing the district's capital improvement program and consider the need for financing to maintain the progress on the capital improvement program.
2. Developing a Request for Proposal (RFP) that will be used in the selection of bond counsel, financial advisor and/or underwriter if necessary.
<!-- Page 117 -->
3. Selecting the financing participants for each debt issue, ensuring the debt issue is integrated with the district's overall financing program, approving the structure of each debt issue, and reviewing and approving all documentation for each issue.

4. Overseeing the preparation of the information for the official statement for debt issues.

5. Meeting as necessary in preparation for a financing or to review changes in state or federal laws or regulations.

6. Preparing all information for the bond rating agencies and making presentations as necessary.

7. Administering post debt issuance responsibilities, including the investment and expenditure of the debt proceeds, compliance with annual reporting requirements, and taking steps to help ensure that debt payments are made on time.

8. Ensuring that the arbitrage requirements are monitored and that the appropriate reports are filed with the federal government.

9. Implementing and managing internal control procedures to ensure that the proceeds of proposed debt will be directed to the intended use. (Government Code section 8855(i)(1)(E))

**Bond Counsel**

The district will seek the legal advice of the bond counsel on questions involving state and federal law on proposed and outstanding debt issuances. Bond counsel will prepare the resolutions, legal documents, and opinions necessary for delivery of a valid debt issuance. The bond counsel will determine the district's compliance with all applicable laws and procedures for issuing debt. At the district's discretion, bond counsel may also serve as disclosure counsel, and prepare the documents traditionally performed in this capacity including delivery of the Official Statement, Bond Purchase Agreement, and Notice of Sale, and Continuing Disclosure Agreement. The bond counsel will perform other services as defined by the contract approved by the district.

**Financial Advisor/Underwriter**

District staff will seek the advice of a financial advisor and/or underwriter when necessary. The financial advisor will advise on the structuring of the debt obligations that will be issued, inform the district of the options available for each issue, advise the district as to how choices will impact the marketability of the district's obligations, and provide other services as defined by the contract approved by the district.

**Use of Short- and Long-Term Debt**

The district's debt policy for the use of Short-Term Operating Debt and Long-Term Capital Debt (Government Code section 8855(i)(1)(A)) is provided below.

1. **Short-Term Debt**
   - Internal interim financing - In order to defer the issuance of debt obligations, when sufficient non-restricted funds are on hand, consideration will be given to appropriating them to provide interim financing for large construction projects. When the debt obligation is subsequently issued, the non-restricted funds will be repaid.
   - External interim financing - Expenditures associated with the day-to-day operations of the district will be covered by current revenues. However, because the district does not receive its revenues in equal installments each month and the largest expenditures occur in equal amounts, the district may experience temporary cash shortfalls. To finance these temporary cash shortfalls, the district may incur short-term operating debt, typically, tax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANS). The district will base the amount of the short-term operating debt on cash flow projections for the fiscal year and will comply with applicable federal and state regulations. The district will pledge operating revenues to repay the debt, which will be repaid in one year or less. The district will minimize the cost of the short-term borrowings to the extent possible and may participate in pooled TRANS to meet this goal.

2. **Long-term Capital Debt**
<!-- Page 118 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x971.png?text=Document+Image)

Prior to issuing debt, the district will examine the relationship of the debt to be issued with the consideration to its capital improvement plan. (Government Code section 8855(i)(1)(C)) It will consider the following factors as part of its evaluation:

a. The district will not use long-term obligations for operating purposes.

b. The weighted average maturity will not exceed 120 percent of the remaining expected useful life of the project financed.

c. The district will structure debt in a manner that maximizes debt proceeds, minimizes interest costs, and allows for future debt issuances. The debt structure will also reflect the financing needs and projected ability to make debt payments through the repayment of the debt issued.

d. The district will not issue unfunded long-term debt in excess of 3 percent of annual general fund revenues, unless there is a dedicated tax levy, surplus property sale, fixed lease payments from another public agency or redevelopment revenue stream committed to service the debt.

Types of Debt  
Described below are the types of debt that may be issued under this debt policy. (Government Code section 8855(i)(1)(B))

1. General obligation bonds, lease revenue bonds, certificates of participation, lease purchase transactions, land secured financings, and bond, lease or grant anticipation notes that may be issued to finance significant capital improvements. The district will primarily rely on the issuance of general obligation bonds to fund its capital projects. All projects financed by general obligation bonds will be determined by the district's project list approved by the voters, the constraints of applicable law, and district's priorities.

2. Refundings  
The district will consider refunding debt whenever an analysis indicates the potential for present value savings of approximately four percent of the principal being refunded or at least $200,000. The financial advisor will compute the economic gain or loss on the refunding and the superintendent or designee, the chief financial officer, and director of fiscal services will verify the computation.

3. Capital Leases  
Capital leasing is an option for the acquisition of equipment or other assets with a cost of less than $500,000. The district will not consider leasing when there are available funds on hand for the acquisition unless the interest expense associated with the lease is less than the interest that can be earned by investing the funds on hand or when other factors such as budget constraints override the economic consideration.

When a lease is arranged with a private sector entity, the district will seek a tax-exempt rate. When a lease is arranged with a government or other tax-exempt entity, the district will try to obtain an explicitly defined taxable rate so that the lease will not be counted in the district's total annual borrowings subject to arbitrage rebate.

The lease agreement will permit the district to refinance the lease at no more than reasonable cost. A lease that can be called at will is preferable to one that can merely be accelerated.

Method of Sale
<!-- Page 119 -->
![Document](https://simbli.eboardsolutions.com/SU/kYHEVEq49aXOnufyQhbwA==)  
When feasible and economical, the district may issue bonds either by competitive or negotiated sale. Whenever the option exists to offer an issue either for competition or negotiation, the superintendent or designee, the chief financial officer, and director of fiscal services will undertake an analysis of the options to aid in the decision-making process.

District staff may use a private placement by obtaining at least three competitive proposals. In evaluating the proposals, the net present value of the competitive bids will be compared, taking into account how and when the payments are made. If required by statute, the purchase price of equipment will be competitively bid.

**Bond Rating**  
District staff will monitor its credit ratings, and provide all information relevant for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining, and improving its credit ratings.

**Arbitrage Liability Management**  
The district will make every effort to minimize the cost of the arbitrage rebate and yield restriction while strictly complying with the law. The federal arbitrage law is intended to discourage entities from issuing tax exempt obligations unnecessarily. In complying with the spirit of the law, the district will not issue obligations except for identifiable projects with very good prospects of timely initiation. Obligations will be issued as closely in time as feasible to the time contracts are awarded so as to minimize the time the debt proceeds are unspent.

The district's bond counsel and financial advisor will review, in advance, all arbitrage rebate payments and forms submitted to the IRS.

# SACRAMENTO COUNTY  
## Annual Investment Policy  
### of the Pooled Investment Fund  
#### CALENDAR YEAR 2023  

I. Authority  
Under the Sacramento County Charter, the Board of Supervisors established the position of Director of Finance and by ordinance will annually review and renew the Director of Finance’s authority to invest and reinvest all the funds in the County Treasury.  

II. Policy Statement  
This Investment Policy (Policy) establishes cash management and investment guidelines for the Director of Finance, who is responsible for the stewardship of the Sacramento County Pooled Investment Fund. Each transaction and the entire portfolio must comply with California Government Code and this Policy. All portfolio activities will be judged by the standards of the Policy and its investment objectives. Activities that violate its spirit and intent will be considered contrary to the Policy.  

III. Standard of Care  
The Director of Finance is the Trustee of the Pooled Investment Fund and therefore, a fiduciary subject to the prudent investor standard. The Director of Finance, employees involved in the investment process, and members of the Sacramento County Treasury Oversight Committee (Oversight Committee) shall refrain from all personal business activities that could conflict with the management of the investment program. All individuals involved will be required to report all gifts and income in accordance with California state law. When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling and managing public funds, the Director of Finance shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence to meet the aims of the investment objectives listed in Section IV, Investment Objectives.  

IV. Investment Objectives  
The Pooled Investment Fund shall be prudently invested in order to earn a reasonable return, while awaiting application for governmental purposes. The specific objectives for the Pooled Investment Fund are ranked in order of importance.  

A. Safety of Principal  
The preservation of principal is the primary objective. Each transaction shall seek to ensure that capital losses are avoided, whether they be from securities default or erosion of market value.  

Page 1

<!-- Page 125 -->
# Annual Investment Policy of the Pooled Investment Fund
## Calendar Year 2023

### B. Liquidity
As a second objective, the Pooled Investment Fund should remain sufficiently flexible to enable the Director of Finance to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated in any depositor's fund.

### C. Public Trust
In managing the Pooled Investment Fund, the Director of Finance and the authorized investment traders should avoid any transactions that might impair public confidence in Sacramento County and the participating local agencies. Investments should be made with precision and care, considering the probable safety of the capital as well as the probable income to be derived.

### D. Maximum Rate of Return
As the fourth objective, the Pooled Investment Fund should be designed to attain a market average rate of return through budgetary and economic cycles, consistent with the risk limitations, prudent investment principles and cash flow characteristics identified herein. For comparative purposes, the State of California Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) will be used as a performance benchmark. The Pooled Investment Fund quarterly performance benchmark target has been set at or above LAIF's yield. This benchmark was chosen because LAIF’s portfolio structure is similar to the Pooled Investment Fund.

### V. Pooled Investment Fund Investors
The Pooled Investment Fund investors are comprised of Sacramento County, school and community college districts, districts directed by the Board of Supervisors, and independent special districts and joint powers authorities whose treasurer is the Director of Finance. Any local agencies not included in this category are subject to California Government Code section 53684 and are referred to as outside investors.

### VI. Implementation
In order to provide direction to those responsible for management of the Pooled Investment Fund, the Director of Finance has established this Policy and will provide it to the Oversight Committee and render it to legislative bodies of local agencies that participate in the Pooled Investment Fund. In accordance with California Government Code section 53646, et seq., the Board of Supervisors shall review and approve this Policy annually at a public meeting.

This Policy provides a detailed description of investment parameters used to implement the investment process and includes the following: investable funds; authorized instruments; prohibited investments; credit requirements; maximum maturities and concentrations; repurchase agreements; Community Reinvestment Act Program; criteria

VII. Internal Controls  
The Director of Finance shall establish internal controls to provide reasonable assurance that the investment objectives are met and to ensure that the assets are protected from loss, theft, or misuse. To assist in implementation and internal controls, the Director of Finance has established an Investment Group and a Review Group.

The Investment Group, which is comprised of the Director of Finance and his/her designees, is responsible for maintenance of the investment guidelines and Approved Lists. These guidelines and lists can be altered daily, if needed, to adjust to the ever-changing financial markets. The guidelines can be more conservative or match the policy language. In no case can the guidelines override the Policy.

The Review Group, which is comprised of the Director of Finance and his/her designees, is responsible for the monthly review and appraisal of all the investments purchased by the Director of Finance and staff. This review includes bond proceeds, which are invested separately from the Pooled Investment Fund and are not governed by this Policy.

The Director of Finance shall establish a process for daily, monthly, quarterly, and annual review and monitoring of the Pooled Investment Fund activity. The following articles, in order of supremacy, govern the Pooled Investment Fund:

1. California Government Code  
2. Annual Investment Policy  
3. Current Investment Guidelines  
4. Approved Lists (see page 9, Section IX.K)  

The Director of Finance shall review the daily investment activity and corresponding bank balances.

Monthly, the Review Group shall review all investment activity and its compliance to the corresponding governing articles and investment objectives.

All securities purchased, with the exception of bank deposits, money market mutual funds, and LAIF, shall be delivered to the independent third-party custodian selected by the Director of Finance. This includes all collateral for repurchase agreements. All trades, where applicable, will be executed by delivery versus payment by the designated third-party custodian.

VIII. Sacramento County Treasury Oversight Committee  
In accordance with California Government Code section 27130 et seq., the Board of Supervisors, in consultation with the Director of Finance, has created the Sacramento County Treasury Oversight Committee (Oversight Committee). Annually, the Oversight  
Page 3
<!-- Page 127 -->
# Annual Investment Policy of the Pooled Investment Fund
## Calendar Year 2023

Committee shall cause an audit to be conducted on the Pooled Investment Fund. The meetings of the Oversight Committee shall be open to the public and subject to the Ralph M. Brown Act.

A member of the Oversight Committee may not be employed by an entity that has contributed to the campaign of a candidate for the office of local treasurer, or contributed to the campaign of a candidate to be a member of a legislative body of any local agency that has deposited funds in the county treasury, in the previous three years or during the period that the employee is a member of the Oversight Committee. A member may not directly or indirectly raise money for a candidate for local treasurer or a member of the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors or governing board of any local agency that has deposited funds in the county treasury while a member of the Oversight Committee. Finally, a member may not secure employment with, or be employed by bond underwriters, bond counsel, security brokerages or dealers, or financial services firms, with whom the treasurer is doing business during the period that the person is a member of the Oversight Committee or for one year after leaving the committee.

The Oversight Committee is not allowed to direct individual investment decisions, select individual investment advisors, brokers or dealers, or impinge on the day-to-day operations of the Department of Finance treasury and investment operations.

## IX. Investment Parameters

### A. Investable Funds
Total Investable Funds (TIF) for purposes of this Policy are all Pooled Investment Fund moneys that are available for investment at any one time, including the estimated bank account float. Included in TIF are funds of outside investors, if applicable, for which the Director of Finance provides investment services. Excluded from TIF are all funds held in separate portfolios.

The Cash Flow Horizon is the period in which the Pooled Investment Fund cash flow can be reasonably forecasted. This Policy establishes the Cash Flow Horizon to be one (1) year.

Once the Director of Finance has deemed that the cash flow forecast can be met, the Director of Finance may invest funds in securities with maturities beyond one year. These securities will be referred to as the Core Portfolio.

### B. Authorized Investments
Authorized investments shall match the general categories established by the California Government Code sections 53601 et seq. and 53635 et seq. Authorized investments shall include, in accordance with California Government Code section 16429.1, investments into LAIF. Authorization for specific instruments within these general categories, as well as narrower portfolio concentration and maturity limits, will be established and maintained by the Investment Group as part of the Investment.

### Guidelines
As the California Government Code is amended, this Policy shall likewise become amended.

### C. Prohibited Investments
No investments shall be authorized that have the possibility of returning a zero or negative yield if held to maturity except for securities issued by, or backed by, the United States government during a period of negative market interest rates. Prohibited investments shall include inverse floaters, range notes, and interest only strips derived from a pool of mortgages.

All legal investments issued by a tobacco-related company are prohibited. A tobacco-related company is defined as an entity that makes smoking products from tobacco used in cigarettes, cigars, or snuff or for smoking in pipes. The tobacco-related issuers restricted from any investment are any component companies in the Dow Jones U.S. Tobacco Index or the NYSE Arca Tobacco Index.

### D. Credit Requirements
Except for municipal obligations and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) bank deposits and certificates of deposit, the issuer's short-term credit ratings shall be at or above A-1 by Standard & Poor's, P-1 by Moody's, and, if available, F1 by Fitch, and the issuer's long-term credit ratings shall be at or above A by Standard & Poor’s, A2 by Moody's, and, if available, A by Fitch. There are no credit requirements for Registered State Warrants. All other municipal obligations shall be at or above a short-term rating of SP-1 by Standard & Poor’s, MIG1 by Moody’s, and, if available, F1 by Fitch.

Eligible banks must have Community Reinvestment Act performance ratings of “satisfactory” or “outstanding” from their federal regulator. In addition, deposits greater than the federally-insured amount must be collateralized. Banks must either have a letter of credit issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco or place securities worth between 110% and 150% of the value of the deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, or a trust bank.

Since credit unions do not have Community Reinvestment Act performance ratings, they must demonstrate a commitment to community reinvestment lending and charitable activities comparable to what is required of banks.

All commercial paper and medium-term note issues must be issued by corporations operating within the United States and having total assets in excess of one billion dollars ($1,000,000,000).

The Investment Group may raise these credit standards as part of the Investment Guidelines and Approved Lists. Appendix A provides a Comparison and Interpretation of Credit Ratings by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, and Fitch.

E. Maximum Maturities  
Due to the nature of the invested funds, no investment with limited market liquidity should be used. Appropriate amounts of highly-liquid investments, such as U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, should be maintained to accommodate unforeseen withdrawals.

The maximum maturity, determined as the term from the date of ownership to the date of maturity, for each investment shall be established as follows:

- U.S. Treasury and Agency Obligations..................................................5 years
- Washington Supranational Obligations¹...........................................5 years
- Municipal Notes ..................................................................................5 years
- Registered State Warrants ..................................................................5 years
- Bankers Acceptances .........................................................................180 days
- Commercial Paper..............................................................................270 days
- Negotiable Certificates of Deposit......................................................180 days
- CRA Bank Deposit/Certificates of Deposit.........................................1 year

The Investment Group may reduce these maturity limits to a shorter term as part of the Investment Guidelines and the Approved Lists.

The ultimate maximum maturity of any investment shall be five (5) years. The dollar-weighted average maturity of all securities shall be equal to or less than three (3) years.

### F. Maximum Concentrations

No more than 80% of the portfolio may be invested in issues other than U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations. The maximum allowable percentage for each type of security is set forth as follows:

- U.S. Treasury and Agency Obligations .................................................. 100%
- Municipal Notes .................................................................................. 80%
- Registered State Warrants .................................................................. 80%
- Bankers Acceptances .......................................................................... 40%
- Commercial Paper ............................................................................... 40%

- Money Market Mutual Funds ................................................................ 20%
- Collateralized Mortgage Obligations ................................................... 20%
- Local Agency Investment Fund (LAIF) ............................................... (per State limit)

The Investment Group may reduce these concentrations as part of the Investment Guidelines and the Approved Lists.

Excluding U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, no more than 10% of the portfolio may be invested in securities of a single issuer including its related entities.

Where a percentage limitation is established above, for the purpose of determining investment compliance, that maximum percentage will be applied on the date of purchase.

### G. Repurchase Agreements

Under California Government Code section 53601, paragraph (j) and section 53635, the Director of Finance may enter into Repurchase Agreements and Reverse Repurchase Agreements. The maximum maturity of a Repurchase Agreement shall be one year. The maximum maturity of a reverse repurchase agreement shall be 92 days, and the proceeds of a reverse repurchase agreement may not be invested beyond the expiration of the agreement. The reverse repurchase agreement must be "matched to maturity" and meet all other requirements in the code.

All repurchase agreements must have an executed Sacramento County Master Repurchase Agreement on file with both the Director of Finance and the

**Broker/Dealer.** Repurchase Agreements executed with approved broker-dealers must be collateralized with either: (1) U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations with a market value of 102% for collateral marked to market daily; or (2) money market instruments on the Approved Lists of the County that meet the qualifications of the Policy, with a market value of 102%. Since the market value of the underlying securities is subject to daily market fluctuations, investments in repurchase agreements shall be in compliance if the value of the underlying securities is brought back up to 102% no later than the next business day. Use of mortgage-backed securities for collateral is not permitted. Strictly for purposes of investing the daily excess bank balance, the collateral provided by the Sacramento County's depository bank can be U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations valued at 110%, or mortgage-backed securities valued at 150%.

**H. Community Reinvestment Act Program**  
The Director of Finance has allocated within the Pooled Investment Fund, a maximum of $90 million for the Community Reinvestment Act Program to encourage community investment by financial institutions, which includes community banks and credit unions, and to acknowledge and reward local financial institutions that support the community's financial needs. The Director of Finance may increase this amount, as appropriate, while staying within the investment policy objectives and maximum maturity and concentration limits. The eligible banks and savings banks must have Community Reinvestment Act performance ratings of “satisfactory” or “outstanding” from each financial institution’s regulatory authority. The minimum credit requirements are located on page 5 of Section IX.D.

**I. Criteria and Qualifications of Brokers/Dealers and Direct Issuers**  
All transactions initiated on behalf of the Pooled Investment Fund and Sacramento County shall be executed through either government security dealers reporting as primary dealers to the Market Reports Division of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or direct issuers that directly issue their own securities that have been placed on the Approved List of brokers/dealers and direct issuers. Further, these firms must have an investment grade rating from at least two national rating services, if available.

Brokers/Dealers and direct issuers that have exceeded the political contribution limits, as contained in Rule G-37 of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, within the preceding four-year period to the Director of Finance, any member of the Board of Supervisors, or any candidate for the Board of Supervisors, are prohibited from the Approved List of brokers/dealers and direct issuers.

Each broker/dealer and direct issuer will be sent a copy of this Policy and a list of those persons authorized to execute investment transactions. Each firm must acknowledge receipt of such materials to qualify for the Approved List of brokers/dealers and direct issuers.

Costs of these respective areas are accumulated by specific cost accounting projects and charged to the Pooled Investment Fund on a quarterly basis throughout the fiscal year.

The Department of Finance will allocate the net interest earnings of the Pooled Investment Fund quarterly. The net interest earnings are allocated based upon the average daily cash balance of each Pooled Investment Fund participant.

### X. Reviewing, Monitoring and Reporting of the Portfolio
The Review Group will prepare and present to the Director of Finance at least monthly a comprehensive review and evaluation of the transactions, positions, performance of the Pooled Investment Fund and compliance to the California Government Code, Policy, and Investment Guidelines.

Quarterly, the Director of Finance will provide to the Board of Supervisors, the Oversight Committee, and to any local agency participant that requests a copy, a detailed report on the Pooled Investment Fund. The report will also be posted on the Department of Finance website.

For the total Pooled Investment Fund, the report will list average maturity, the market value, and the pricing source.

### XI. Withdrawal Requests for Pooled Fund Investors
The Director of Finance will honor all requests to withdraw funds for normal cash flow purposes that are approved by the Director of Finance at a one dollar net asset value. Any requests to withdraw funds for purposes other than immediate cash flow needs, such as for external investing, are subject to the consent of the Director of Finance. In accordance with California Government Code Sections 27133(h) and 27136, such requests for withdrawals must first be made in writing to the Director of Finance. When evaluating a request to withdraw funds, the Director of Finance will take into account the effect of a withdrawal on the stability and predictability of the Pooled Investment Fund and the interests of other depositors. Any withdrawal for such purposes will be at the market value of the Pooled Investment Fund on the date of the withdrawal.

### XII. Limits on Honoraria, Gifts, and Gratuities
In accordance with California Government Code Section 27133(d), this Policy establishes limits for the Director of Finance; individuals responsible for management of the portfolios; and members of the Investment Group and Review Group who direct individual investment decisions, select individual investment advisors and broker/dealers, and conduct day-to-day investment trading activity. The limits also apply to members of the Oversight Committee. Any individual who receives an aggregate total of gifts, honoraria and gratuities in excess of $50 in a calendar year from a broker/dealer, bank or service provider to the Pooled Investment Fund must report the gifts, dates and firms to the designated filing official and complete the appropriate State form.

No individual may receive aggregate gifts, honoraria, and gratuities from any single source in a calendar year in excess of the amount specified in Section 18400.2(a) of Title 2, Division 6 of the California Code of Regulations. This limitation was $520 for the year.

The Governing Board recognizes that extracurricular and cocurricular activities enrich the educational and social development and experiences of students and enhance students’ feelings of connectedness with the schools. The district shall encourage and support student participation in extracurricular and cocurricular activities without compromising the integrity and purpose of the educational program.

**Prerequisites for student participation in extracurricular and cocurricular activities shall be limited to those that have been demonstrated to be essential to the success of the activity. No extracurricular or cocurricular program or activity shall be provided or conducted separately on the basis of any actual or perceived characteristic listed as a prohibited category of discrimination in state or federal law, nor shall any student's participation in an extracurricular or cocurricular activity be required or refused on those bases.** (5 CCR 4925)

Any complaint alleging unlawful discrimination in the district's extracurricular or cocurricular programs or activities shall be filed in accordance with BP/AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.

Unless specifically authorized by law, no student shall be charged a fee for their participation in educational activities, including extracurricular and cocurricular activities and materials or equipment related to such activities. (Education Code sections 49010, 49011)

**Eligibility Requirements**  
To be eligible to participate in extracurricular and cocurricular activities, students in grades 7 through 12 must demonstrate satisfactory educational progress in the previous grading period including but not limited to: (Education Code section 35160.5)

1. Maintenance of a minimum 2.0 grade point average on a 4.0 scale in all enrolled classes  
2. Maintenance of minimum progress toward meeting high school graduation requirements

Any decision regarding the eligibility of a homeless student, foster youth, or a child of an active duty military family for extracurricular or cocurricular activities shall be made by the superintendent or designee in accordance with Education Code sections 48850 and 49701.

The superintendent or designee may revoke a student’s eligibility for participation in extracurricular and cocurricular activities when the student’s poor citizenship is serious enough to warrant loss of this privilege.

**Student Conduct at Extracurricular/Cocurricular Events**  
When attending or participating in extracurricular and cocurricular activities on or off campus, district students are subject to district policies and regulations relating to student conduct. Students who violate district policies and regulations may be subject to discipline including, but not limited to, suspension, expulsion, transfer to alternative programs, or denial of participation in extracurricular or cocurricular activities in accordance with board policy and administrative regulation.

**Policy 6020: Parent Involvement**  
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992 | **Last Revised Date:** 02/09/2021 | **Last Reviewed Date:** 01/10/2023  
**Status:** ADOPTED  

The Governing Board recognizes that parents/guardians are their children’s first and most influential teachers and that sustained parent/guardian involvement in the education of their children contributes greatly to student achievement and a positive school environment. The superintendent or designee shall work with parents/guardians and family members to jointly develop and agree upon policy and strategies to meaningfully involve parents/guardians and family members in district and school activities at all grade levels; advisory, decision-making and advocacy roles, and activities to support learning at school and at home.

Parents/guardians shall be notified of their rights to be informed about and to participate in their children’s education and of the opportunities available to them to do so.

The district's local control and accountability plan (LCAP) shall include goals and strategies for parent/guardian involvement and family engagement, including district efforts to seek parent/guardian input in district and school site decision making and to promote parent/guardian participation in programs for English learners, foster youth, students eligible for free and reduced-price meals, and students with disabilities. (Education Code sections 42238.02, 52060)

The superintendent or designee shall regularly evaluate and report to the board on the effectiveness of the district's parent/guardians and family engagement efforts, including, but not limited to, input from parents/guardians, family members, and school staff on the adequacy of involvement opportunities and on barriers that may inhibit participation.

**Title I Schools**  
The superintendent or designee shall involve parents/guardians and family members in establishing district expectations and objectives for meaningful parent/guardian and family engagement in schools supported by Title I funding, developing strategies that describe how the district will carry out each activity listed in 20 USC 6318, as contained in accompanying administrative regulation, and implementing and evaluating such programs activities, and procedures. As appropriate, the superintendent or designee shall conduct outreach to all parents/guardians and family members. (Education Code section 11503; 20 USC 6318)

When the district’s Title I, Part A allocation exceeds the amount specified in 20 USC 6318, the board shall reserve at least one percent of the funding to implement parent/guardian and family engagement activities and shall distribute at least 90 percent of those reserved funds to eligible schools, with priority given to high-need schools as defined in 20 USC 6631. The superintendent or designee shall involve parents/guardians and family members of participating students in decisions regarding how the district's Title I funds will be allotted for parent/guardian and family engagement activities. (20 USC 6318)

Expenditures of such funds shall be consistent with the activities specified in this policy and shall include at least one of the following: (20 USC 6318)  
1. Support for schools and nonprofit organizations in providing professional development for district and school staff regarding parent/guardian and family engagement strategies, which may be provided jointly to teachers, principals, other school leaders, specialized instructional support personnel, paraprofessionals, early childhood educators, and parents/guardians and family members.

2. Support for programs that reach parents/guardians and family members at home, in the community, and at school  
3. Dissemination of information on best practices focused on parent/guardian and family engagement, especially best practices for increasing the engagement of economically disadvantaged parents/guardians and family members  
4. Collaboration or the provision of sub grants to schools to enable collaboration, with community-based organizations or employers with a record of success in improving and increasing parent and family engagement  
5. Any other activities and strategies that the district determines are appropriate and consistent with this policy.  

The district’s board policy and administrative regulation containing parent/guardian and family engagement strategies shall be incorporated into the district’s LCAP in accordance with 20 USC 6312. (20 USC 6318)  

The superintendent or designee shall ensure that each school receiving Title I funds develops a school-level parent/guardian and family engagement policy in accordance with 20 USC 6318.  

District and school-level parent/guardian and family engagement policies and administrative regulations shall be distributed to parents/guardians of students participating in Title I programs and shall be available to the local community. Parents/guardians shall be notified of the policy in an understandable and uniform format and, to the extent practicable, provided in a language the parents/guardians can understand. (20 USC 6318)  

Non-Title I Schools  
The superintendent or designee shall develop and implement strategies applicable to each school that does not receive federal Title I funds to encourage the involvement and support of parents/guardians in the education of their children, including, but not limited to, strategies describing how the district and schools will address the purposes and goals described in Education Code section 11502. (Education Code section 11504)

![Policy 5116.1: Intra-district Open Enrollment](https://example.com/image.png)

**Policy 5116.1: Intra-district Open Enrollment**  
**Original Adopted Date:** 10/26/2010 | **Last Revised Date:** 02/15/2022 | **Last Reviewed Date:** 01/10/2023  
**Status:** ADOPTED  

The Governing Board desires to provide enrollment options that meet the diverse needs and interests of district students and parents/guardians, while maximizing the efficient use of district facilities and resources. The superintendent or designee shall establish procedures for the selection and transfer of students among district schools in accordance with law, board policy, and administrative regulation.

The parent/guardian of any student who resides within district boundaries may apply to enroll their child in any district school, regardless of the location of residence within the district. (Education Code section 35160.5)

The board shall annually review this policy. (Education Code sections 35160.5, 48980)

In order to ensure that priorities for enrollment in district schools are implemented in accordance with law, applications for intradistrict open enrollment shall be submitted between the first Monday in December and the third Friday in January of the school year preceding the school year for which the transfer is requested.

**Enrollment Priorities**

No student who currently resides in the attendance area of a school shall be displaced by students transferring from outside the attendance area. (Education Code section 35160.5)

The superintendent or designee shall grant priority for enrollment of a student in a district school outside of the student’s attendance area, if the student:

1. Is a victim of a violent crime while on school grounds. (20 USC 7912)
2. Is enrolled in a district school designated by the California Department of Education (“CDE”) as "persistently dangerous." (20 USC 7912; 5 CCR 11992)
3. Is a victim of an act of bullying committed by another district student, as determined through an investigation on following the parent’s/guardian’s submission of a written complaint with the school, district, or local law enforcement agency pursuant to Education Code sec on 46600. If the district school requested by the student is at maximum capacity, the superintendent or designee shall accept an intradistrict transfer request for another district school. (Education Code section 46600)
4. Is currently enrolled in a district school identified by CDE for comprehensive support and improvement, with priority given to the lowest academically achieving students from low-income families as determined pursuant to 20 USC 6313(a)(3). (20 USC 6311)
5. Is experiencing special circumstances that might be harmful or dangerous to the student in the current attendance area, including, but not limited to, threats of bodily harm or threats to the emotional stability of the student. Any such student may transfer to a district school that is at capacity and otherwise closed to transfers. To grant priority under these special circumstances, the superintendent or designee must have received: (Education Code section 35160.5)

   a. A written statement from a representative of an appropriate state or local agency, including, but not necessarily limited to, a law enforcement official, a social worker, or a properly licensed or registered professional, including, but not limited to, a psychiatrist, psychologist, or marriage and family therapist, clinical social worker, or professional clinical counselor.  
   b. A court order, including a temporary restraining order and injunction.  

35
<!-- Page 151 -->
![Image](https://simbli.eboardsolutions.com/SU/KWay0PGOpuyslhWOKiF8O8U=)

6. Is a sibling of another student already attending that school.

7. has a parent/guardian whose primary place of employment is that school.

## Application and Selection Process

Except for the enrollment priorities listed above, the superintendent or designee shall use a random, unbiased selection process to determine which students shall be admitted whenever a district school receives admission requests that are in excess of the school's capacity. A school's capacity shall be calculated in a nonarbitrary manner using student enrollment and available space. (Education Code section 35160.5)

Enrollment decisions shall not be based on a student's academic or athletic performance. However, existing entrance criteria may be used for enrolling students in specialized schools or programs provided that the criteria are uniformly applied to all applicants. In addition, academic performance may be used to determine eligibility for, or placement in, programs for gifted and talented students. (Education Code section 35160.5)

## Transportation

In general, the district shall not be obligated to provide transportation for students who attend school outside of their attendance area.

However, upon parent/guardian request, the district shall provide transportation assistance to any student who is eligible for free or reduced-price meals and whose enrollment in a district school outside the student’s attendance area is a result of being the victim of bullying. (Education Code section 46600)

**Policy 0410: Nondiscrimination In District Programs And Activities**  
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992 | **Last Revised Date:** 04/25/2023 | **Last Reviewed Date:** 04/25/2023  
**Status:** ADOPTED  

This policy shall apply to all acts related to a school activity or school attendance and to all acts of the governing board and the superintendent in enacting policies and procedures that govern the district.

The governing board is committed to providing equal opportunity for all individuals in district programs and activities. District programs, activities, and practices shall be free from unlawful discrimination, including discrimination against an individual or group based on race, color, ancestry, nationality, national origin, immigration status, ethnic group identification, ethnicity, age, religion, marital status, pregnancy, parental status, reproductive health decision-making, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sex (including sexual harassment), sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, veteran or military status, genetic information, or affiliation with the Boys Scouts of America; a perception of one or more such characteristics; or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. The board shall promote programs which ensure that discriminatory practices are eliminated in all district activities.

All individuals shall be treated equitably in the receipt of district and school services. Personally identifiable information collected in the implementation of any district program, including, but not limited to, student and family information for the free and reduced-price lunch program, transportation, or any other educational program, shall be used only for the purposes of the program, except when the superintendent or designee authorizes its use for another purpose in accordance with law. Resources and data collected by the district shall not be used, directly or by others, to compile a list, registry, or database of individuals based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, national origin, or immigration status or any other category identified above.

District programs and activities shall be free of any discriminatory use, selection, or rejection of textbooks, instructional materials, library books, or similar educational resources.

The use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library shall not be rejected or prohibited by the board or district on the basis that it includes a study of the role and contributions of any individual or group consistent with the requirements of Education Code 51204.5 and 60040, unless such study would violate Education Code 51501 or 60044. (Education Code 243)

District programs and activities shall be free of any racially derogatory or discriminatory school or athletic team names, mascots, or nicknames.

Physical education classes shall be conducted in the coeducational, inclusive manner prescribed by law. The district shall provide instruction in physical education that provides equal access and equal opportunities for participation for all students in grades 1-12 regardless of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, and mental or physical disability. (Education Code sections 220, 221.5, 33352; 5 CCR 4900, 4931, 4940, 4960; 34 CFR 106.33, 106.34, 300.108)

The superintendent or designee shall annually review district programs and activities to ensure the removal of any derogatory or discriminatory name, image, practice, or other barrier that may unlawfully prevent an individual or group in any of the protected categories stated above from accessing district programs and activities, including the use of facilities. They superintendent or designee shall take prompt,
<!-- Page 157 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x971.png?text=Document+Image)

reasonable actions to remove any identified barrier. The superintendent or designee shall report their findings and recommendations to the board after each review.

All allegations of unlawful discrimination in district programs and activities shall be brought, investigated and resolved in accordance with the procedures specified in ARBoard Policy 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.

Pursuant to 34 CFR 104.8 and 34 CFR 106.9, the superintendent or designee shall notify students, parents/guardians, employees, employee organizations, applicants for admission and employment, and sources of referral for applicants about the district's policy on nondiscrimination and related complaint procedures. Such notification shall be included in the annual parental notification distributed pursuant to Education Code section 48980 and, as applicable, in announcements, bulletins, catalogs, handbooks, application forms, or other materials distributed by the district. The notification shall also be posted on the district's web site and social media and in district schools and offices, including staff lounges, student government meeting rooms, and other prominent locations as appropriate.

In addition, the annual parental notification shall inform parents/guardians of their children's right to a free public education regardless of immigration status or religious beliefs, including information on educational rights issued by the California Attorney General. Alternatively, such information may be provided through any other cost-effective means determined by the superintendent or designee. (Education Code section 234.7)

The district's nondiscrimination policy and related informational materials shall be published in a format that parents/guardians can understand. In addition, when 15 percent or more of a school's students speak a single primary language other than English, those materials shall be translated into that other language.

Access for Individuals with Disabilities

District programs and facilities, viewed in their entirety, shall be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") and any implementing standards and/or regulations. When structural changes to existing district facilities are needed to provide individuals with disabilities access to programs, services, activities, or facilities, the superintendent or designee shall develop a transition plan that sets forth the steps for completing the changes.

The superintendent or designee shall ensure that the district provides appropriate auxiliary aids and services when necessary to afford individuals with disabilities equal opportunity to participate in or enjoy the benefits of a service, program, or activity. These aids and services may include, but are not limited to, qualified interpreters or readers, assistive listening devices, assistive technologies or other modifications to increase accessibility to district and school web sites, notetakers, written materials, taped text, and Braille or large-print materials.

Individuals with disabilities shall notify the superintendent, or designee, or principal if they have a disability that requires special assistance or services. Reasonable notification should be given prior to the school-sponsored function, program, or meeting.

The below individual position is hereby designated as the district's ADA/Title II coordinator. The coordinator shall receive and address requests for accommodation submitted by individuals with disabilities, and shall investigate and resolve complaints regarding their access to district programs, services, activities, or facilities.

![Policy 1312.2: Complaints Concerning Instructional Materials](https://example.com/image.png)

**Board Policy Manual**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Printed: 11/13/2023 01:06 PM**  
**Status: ADOPTED**  
**Original Adopted Date: 06/09/1992**

**Policy 1312.2: Complaints Concerning Instructional Materials**

The Governing Board takes great care in the adoption of instructional materials and is aware that all adopted materials may not be acceptable to all students, their parents/guardians, or other district residents.

The Superintendent or designee is directed to implement procedures which will permit proper consideration of any complaints against the use of any instructional materials or library/media materials, including textbooks, supplementary textbooks, library books, and other instructional materials and equipment.

The Board believes the Superintendent or designee is well qualified to consider complaints concerning instructional materials. Complainants are advised to consider and accept the Superintendent or designee's decision as final. However, if the complainant finds the decision of the Superintendent or designee unsatisfactory, he/she may appeal the decision within 30 days of request.

The Board will not allow political party affiliation, racial prejudice, a desire to suppress ideas, or an intent to deny students access to ideas with which the Board disagrees, to influence its decision in any such case.

(cf. 1312.4 - Complaints Concerning Categorical Aid Programs)

The Governing Board uses a comprehensive process to adopt district instructional materials that is based on selection criteria established by law and board policy and includes opportunities for the involvement of district staff, parents/guardians, and community members, and, as appropriate, students. Complaints concerning the content or use of instructional materials, including textbooks, supplementary instructional materials, library materials, or other instructional materials and equipment, shall be properly and fairly considered using established complaint procedures.

Parents/guardians are encouraged to discuss any concerns regarding instructional materials with their child's teacher and/or the school principal. If the situation remains unresolved, a complaint may be filed using the process specified in the accompanying administrative regulation and exhibit.

The district shall accept complaints concerning instructional materials only from staff, district residents, or the parents/guardians of children enrolled in a district school. (Education Code section 35160)

However, a complaint related to the use or prohibited use of any existing textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library that alleges unlawful discrimination based on a violation of Education Code section 243 shall be filed, investigated, and resolved in accordance with Board Policy 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.

When deliberating upon challenged materials, the superintendent, or any designee or committee established by the superintendent to review the materials, shall consider the degree to which the materials aligned with the criteria for instructional materials as specified in law, Board policy, and administrative regulation. In addition, such deliberations may consider the educational philosophy and vision of the district; the educational suitability of the materials including the manner in which the materials support the curriculum and appropriateness for the student's age; the professional opinions of teachers of the subject and of other competent authorities and/or experts; reviews of the materials by reputable bodies; the stated objectives in using the materials; community standards; the allegations in the complaint, including the extent to which the objections are based on the dislike of ideas contained in the complaint.

The board recognizes that alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") can, depending on the nature of the allegations, offer a process to reach a resolution to resolving a complaint in a manner that is acceptable to all parties. An ADR process such as mediation may be offered to resolve complaints that involve more than one student and no adult. However, mediation shall not be offered or used to resolve any complaint involving sexual assault or where there is a reasonable risk that a party to the mediation would feel compelled to participate. The superintendent or designee shall ensure that the use of ADR is consistent with state and federal laws and regulations.

The district shall protect all complainants from retaliation. In investigating complaints, the confidentiality of the parties involved shall be protected as required by law. For any complaint alleging retaliation or unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying), the superintendent or designee shall keep the identity of the complainant and/or the subject of the complaint, if he/she is different from the complainant, and/or the subject of the complaint if different from the complainant, confidential when appropriate and as long as the integrity of the complaint process is maintained.

When an allegation that is not subject to the UCP is included in a UCP complaint, the district shall refer the non-UCP allegation to the appropriate state or agency and shall investigate and, if appropriate, resolve the UCP-related allegation(s) through the district's UCP process.

The superintendent or designee shall provide training to district staff to ensure awareness and knowledge of current law and related requirements related to UCP, including the steps and timelines specified in this policy and the accompanying administrative regulation.

The superintendent or designee shall maintain a record of each complaint and subsequent related actions, including steps taken during the investigation and all information required for compliance with 5 CCR 4631 and 4633.

![Policy 5145.3: Nondiscrimination/Harassment](https://via.placeholder.com/768x971.png?text=Policy+5145.3:+Nondiscrimination/Harassment)

**Board Policy Manual**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Printed: 11/13/2023 04:05 PM**  
**Status: ADOPTED**  
**Original Adopted Date: 04/28/2015 | Last Revised Date: 04/25/2023 | Last Reviewed Date: 04/25/2023**  

This policy shall apply to all acts constituting unlawful discrimination or harassment related to school activity or to school attendance occurring within a district school, to acts which occur off campus or outside of school-related or school-sponsored activities but which may have an impact or create a hostile environment at school, and to all acts of the Governing Board and the superintendent in enacting policies and procedures that govern the district.

The governing board desires to provide a welcoming, safe, and supportive school environment that allows all students equal access and opportunities in the district's academic, extracurricular, and other educational support programs, services, and activities. The board prohibits, at any district school or school activity, unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, and bullying targeted at any student by anyone, based on the student's actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, national origin, nationality, immigration status, ethnic group identification, age, religion, marital or parental status, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information, or affiliation with the Boys Scouts of America, or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.

Unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, or bullying or the creation of a hostile environment, may result from physical, verbal, nonverbal, or written conduct based on any of the categories listed above. Unlawful discrimination also includes the creation of a hostile environment throughout which prohibited conduct is so severe, persistent, or pervasive that it affects a student's ability to participate in or benefit from an educational program or activity; creates an intimidating, threatening, hostile, or offensive educational environment; has the effect of substantially or unreasonably interfering with a student's academic performance; or otherwise adversely affects a student's educational opportunities.

Unlawful discrimination also includes disparate treatment of students based on one of the above identified categories above with respect to the provision of opportunities to participate in school programs or activities or the provision or receipt of educational benefits or services.

Because unlawful discrimination may occur when disciplining students, including suspension and expulsion, the superintendent or designee shall ensure that staff enforce discipline rules fairly, consistently and in a non-discriminatory manner, as specified in Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 5144 - Discipline, Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process, and Administrative Regulation 5144.2 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process (Students With Disabilities).

The board also prohibits any form of retaliation against any individual who files, reports or participates in the reporting of unlawful discrimination, files or otherwise participates in the filing of a complaint, or investigates or participates in the reporting, or investigation of a complaint or report alleging unlawful.

discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying. Retaliation complaints shall be investigated and resolved in the same manner as a discrimination complaint.

The superintendent or designee shall facilitate students' access to the educational program by publicizing the district's nondiscrimination policy and related complaint procedures to students, parents/guardians, and employees. In addition, the superintendent or designee shall post the district's policies prohibiting discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying and other required information on the district's website in a manner that is easily accessible to parents/guardians and students, in accordance with law and the accompanying administrative regulation. (Education Code sections 234.1, 234.6)

The superintendent or designee shall provide training and/or information on the scope and use of the policy and complaint procedures and take other measures designed to increase the school community's understanding of the requirements of law related to discrimination. The superintendent or designee shall regularly review the implementation of the district's nondiscrimination policies and practices and, as necessary, shall take action to remove any identified barrier to student access to or participation in the district's educational program. The superintendent or designee shall report their findings and recommendations to the board after each review.

Regardless of whether a complainant complies with the writing, timeline, and/or other formal filing requirements, all complaints alleging unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, or bullying, shall be investigated and prompt action taken to stop the discrimination, prevent recurrence, and address any continuing effect on students.

Students who engage in unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, bullying, or retaliation, in violation of law, board policy, or administrative regulation shall be subject to appropriate consequence or discipline, which may include suspension or expulsion when the behavior is severe or pervasive as defined in Education Code section 48900.4. Any employee who permits or engages in prohibited discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, bullying, or retaliation shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.

All allegations of unlawful discrimination in district programs and activities shall be brought, investigated, and resolved in accordance with Board Policy 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.

The district designates the individuals identified below as the employees responsible for coordinating the district's efforts to comply with applicable state and federal civil rights laws, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and to answer inquiries regarding the district's nondiscrimination policies. The individual(s) shall also serve as the compliance officer(s) specified in AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures as the responsible employee to handle complaints alleging unlawful discrimination targeting a student, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, or bullying, based on the student's actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, nationality, national origin, nationality, immigration status, ethnicity, ethnic group identification, ethnicity, age, religion, marital status, parental status, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information, or any other legally protected status or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.

**Process for Initiating and Responding to Complaints**  
The general counsel or designee may assign other staff to investigate based on the nature of the complaint as directed under BP/AR 1312.3, Uniform Complaint Procedures.  

Any student who feels that they have been subjected to unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, or bullying is strongly encouraged to immediately contact the general counsel, the principal, or any other district employee. Any student who observes any such incident is strongly encouraged to report the incident to the general counsel or principal, or any other district employee whether or not the victim files a complaint. Any district employee who observes an incident of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, or bullying shall report the incident to their supervisor, the general counsel, or principal, whether or not the victim files a complaint. In addition, the district employee shall immediately intervene when safe to do so. (Education Code section 234.1)  

Upon receiving a complaint of unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, or bullying, the general counsel or designee shall immediately investigate the complaint in accordance with AR 1312.2, Uniform Complaint Procedures.  

The general counsel shall ensure that the student and parent handbook clearly describes the district's nondiscrimination policy, procedures for filing a complaint regarding unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, or bullying, and the resources that may be available to students who feel that they have been the victim of any such behavior. The district's policy shall also be posted on the district web site or any other location that is easily accessible to students.  

**Record-Keeping**  
<!-- Page 194 -->
