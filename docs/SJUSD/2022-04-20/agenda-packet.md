San Juan Unified School District  
Board of Education  
3738 Walnut Avenue, Carmichael, California 95608  

**Board of Education Minutes**  
**April 5, 2022**  

**Regular Meeting**  
Board of Education  
4:00 p.m.  

**Open Session/Call to Order (A)**  
The April 5 regular meeting was called to order by the president, Dr. Michael McKibbin. The board meeting was held in person and also livestreamed on the district’s YouTube channel.  

**Roll Call**  
Present:  
Michael McKibbin, Ed.D., president  
Zima Creason, vice president  
Pam Costa, clerk  
Saul Hernandez, member  
Paula Villescaz, member (arrived at 4:14 p.m.)  

**Workshop: Governance Transition to Seven Board Members (A-1)**  
Superintendent Kent introduced Chief of Staff Trent Allen who moderated a dialogue regarding the upcoming governance transition from five to seven board members. Mr. Allen explained that the workshop will be split into two broad topical areas for discussion: representing an area and serving the entire district, and logistics and mechanics.  

The first area of discussion (representing an area and serving the entire district) was broken down into two sub-topics: visiting schools/events and representation and voice. Items discussed were:  

- **Visiting schools and events, including expectations for invitations and RSVPs**  
  Board members expressed support for continuing the current practice of all board members being invited to all events throughout the district and sending RSVPs to the board administrative assistant.  

- **Student board reports, including building connections with students in each area and formal/informal voice**  
  Mr. Allen explained that by-trustee area elections would allow board members to act as liaisons by meeting with students on a more frequent, informal basis. Superintendent Kern shared information about how the Superintendent’s Student Advisory Council has provided him with the opportunity to build relationships with students and to hear student voice. Ms. Creason said she likes the idea of meeting with student representatives, in addition to the high school student council reports during regular board meetings, but she does not want to exclude relationships with students who are outside her trustee area, and she inquired about providing notice to other board members if she meets with students outside of her area. Ms. Costa said informing the other board members is a respectful practice. Mr. Hernandez said he would like to be informed about the outcome of a meeting in his area in the event he has future involvement. Dr. McKibbin supports renewing connections with students in district groups, not just school groups.  

- **Board-appointed committees – selection of committee members, student representation and reporting activities to the board**  
  Mr. Allen stated that with the addition of two board members, the size of board-appointed committees will also grow, and  
2421

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

he proposed the concept of board members selecting committee members from their own trustee area versus throughout the entire district. Superintendent Kern spoke about equal representation throughout the district. Ms. Villescas said she agrees that equal representation is important and should be a priority, but recruitment is a challenge due to the large time commitment that committees require. Ms. Creason said she likes the idea of having representatives from each trustee area, noting that there is talent throughout the district and it should not be limited by area. Mr. Hernandez supports board members selecting committee members from both in and out of their own trustee area, and he spoke about the importance of committee members being able to work effectively, noting that configuration of the Local Control and Accountability Plan Parent Advisory Committee (LCAP PAC) may need to be reexamined. Ms. Costa spoke about the structure of the LCAP PAC and said she agrees with Mr. Hernandez that if the committee was board-appointed, then it may allow for better representation across the district. Dr. McKibbin expressed support for being able to choose the best possible applicants regardless of where they reside, and he encouraged making sure that committee members understand the time commitment and the responsibilities of the committee. Board members also made comments and suggestions related to communicating the role of the committee, recruitment, onboarding and periodic contact with appointees.

Mr. Allen then led the board in a discussion on whether students should have a formal or informal role on committees. Board members agreed that if each board member were to each appoint one student to a committee then the size of the committee would become too large and achieving quorum may become a challenge. The board then discussed having one student representative on each committee, either appointed by the board-liaison or through an application process, in order to allow students to have an equal voice and vote. Superintendent Kern noted that student feedback and input is much more robust than in the past.

Mr. Allen asked board members to consider how they would like committees to report to the board. Ms. Villescas expressed support for consistent written reports, but she is cognizant of not adding more work to the committee. Ms. Creason requested more time to reflect on this topic. Dr. McKibbin supports more committee reports. Ms. Villescas suggested having a yearly schedule for committee reports.

- Board discussion and reports – expectations and norms to provide equal voice and structures to support board members’ reports

Board members discussed items related to time limits for board reports, asking technical questions in advance unless it is an item that needs to be discussed publicly, and indicating a desire to be brought up by the microphone rather than the board member being called on individually.

The second area of discussion (logistics and mechanics) was broken down into four sub-topics: participation in graduations, meeting adjustments, requesting agenda items and meeting materials.

- Participation in graduations – build connections with students in each area and formal/informal voice

Superintendent Kern proposed that board members certify the graduating class rather than giving speeches and that two board members attend each graduation – one in their trustee area and one outside their trustee area. Ms. Villescas supports certifying the class, rather than making a speech, and she supports attending graduations outside her area. Ms. Costa said she agrees with the proposed changes, noting that student speeches are the most powerful. Ms. Creason noted that her trustee area has two high schools, and she likes the framework but supports flexibility as unexpected issues arise. Mr. Hernandez said he likes giving a speech but supports board members certifying the graduating class, and he supports the idea of attending one graduation in his area and one graduation out of his area. Dr. McKibbin said he enjoys giving a speech at graduation.

- Meeting adjustments – time for meetings/adjusting start time and impact on closed session

The board discussed adjusting the meeting start time to 6:00 p.m. to allow for more discussion time with the addition of two board members. Ms. Villescas was not supportive of adjusting the meeting start time due to work commitments, and she noted that regular board meetings typically do not run too late. Mr. Hernandez would like to keep the start time the same for now and take a wait and see approach about the length of the meetings with the addition of two board members. Ms. Creason said she believes public participation is better with a 6:30 p.m. start time, and she noted that shorter agendas might be a way to cut time, if needed, which would also allow for discussing agenda items on a deeper level. Mr. Hernandez appreciates staff giving presentations that cover important information for the community. Ms. Villescas said she appreciates the lived experiences that are included in presentations. Ms. Costa said she likes the real-life stories and workshops, which provide a valuable opportunity for the board to talk to each other about development.
<!-- Page 6 -->
- Requesting agenda items – individual member request vs board request for agenda items and staff added agenda items  
Superintendent Kern explained how some districts require a majority vote of the board to get an item on the future agenda. Ms. Creason said she likes the idea of a majority vote, which offers a transparent process to allow different interests to come to the table and it prevents undo pressure on the board president and superintendent to decide.

- Meeting materials – an opportunity to ponder how we can make board packets even more efficient and useful and a variety of services with unique feature sets  
Mr. Allen explained that staff is in the process of vetting multiple online platforms to allow for board meeting materials to be provided to board members electronically, as well as providing other helpful features for staff and the public such as searching and indexing. Mr. Hernandez talked about the impact of the amount of paper, noting that he prefers receiving supporting documents in a digital format only. Ms. Villeszcaz supports starting the transition to electronic, while still making it optional to request a paper copy. Ms. Costa said she would like an electronic packet to have the ability for note taking and highlighting, inquired about the technology expectation, and would still like to offer the option to request a printed copy. Dr. McKibbin agreed that it is not necessary to print large supporting documents.

Board of Education  
San Juan Unified School District  
3738 Walnut Avenue  
Carmichael, California 95609-0477  

We have performed the procedures enumerated below on San Juan Unified School District (District) management’s assertions concerning Measure "S" ballot language and San Juan Unified School District Board of Education Resolution No. 2090 as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021. District management is responsible for evaluating assertions concerning Measure "S" ballot language and San Juan Unified School District Board of Education Resolution No. 2090.

The Board of Education has agreed to and acknowledged that the procedures performed are appropriate to meet the intended purpose of the engagement, which it to assist in evaluating San Juan Unified School District management assertions concerning Measure “S” ballot language and Resolution No 2090 for the year ended June 30, 2021.

A. That "Measure S Bond funds are spent only on school improvements, not on District salaries or administration."  
B. That the District has continued "funding the Deferred Maintenance Program at a level of no less than $2 million annually."  
C. That the District has funded "housekeeping and maintenance and operations budgets as necessary to properly maintain all District facilities."

This report may not be suitable for any other purpose. The procedures performed may not address all the items of interest to a user of this report and may not meet the needs of all users in this report and, as such, users are responsible for determining whether the procedures performed are appropriate for their purposes.

The procedures and associated findings are as follows:

A. We obtained the Measure S Building Fund detailed general ledger for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. We applied the following procedures to this report:  
1. Recomputed subtotals and totals of the report. No exceptions noted.  
2. Reviewed the detailed general ledger for unallowable expenditures. No exceptions noted.

B. The District's Deferred Maintenance Program was funded at an amount of $2 million for the 20202021 fiscal year, which meets the requirement of at least $2 million annually. The $2 million was transferred from the General Fund. We agreed these totals to the District's audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2021. No exceptions noted.

C. On June 9, 2020, the 2020-21 Budget was adopted by the Board of Education. Included in the 2020-21 Budget is the School District Criteria and Standards Review. The standard for criterion 7 is to “confirm that the annual contribution for facilities maintenance funding is not less than the amount required pursuant to Education Code Section 17070.75, if applicable, and that the district is providing adequately to preserve the functionality of its facilities for their normal life in accordance with Education Code sections 52060(d)(1) and 17002(d)(1).” The District met this standard and fulfilled the requirement for budgeting for the Restricted Routine Maintenance Account. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the District fulfilled the requirement by transferring $15,345,725 from the General Fund Unrestricted accounts to General Fund Restricted Routine Maintenance Account. No exceptions noted.

We were engaged by the District to perform this agreed-upon procedures engagement and conducted our engagement in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. We were not engaged and did not conduct an examination or review engagement, the objective of which would be the expression of such an opinion or conclusion. Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you.

We are required to be independent of the District and to meet our ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our agreed-upon procedures engagement.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Education and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

Independent Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee  
and Board of Education  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

## Report on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Measure J Building Fund of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents.

### Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

### Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Measure J Building Fund of the District, as of June 30, 2021, and the changes in financial position thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Emphasis of Matter**

As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements present only the Measure J Building Fund and do not purport to, and do not present fairly the financial position of the District as of June 30, 2021, or the changes in its financial position for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

**Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards**

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated March 11, 2022, on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

## MEASURE J BUILDING FUND  
### NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
#### JUNE 30, 2021  

As of June 30, 2021, total outstanding debt related to Measure J is $70,434,932.  

The Board of Supervisors of Sacramento County is empowered and obligated to annually levy ad valorem taxes, without limitation as to rate or amount, upon all property subject to taxation within the District (except for certain property which is taxable at limited rates), for payment of interest and principal of the Bonds when due. The District has established separate debt service funds to account for the collection and remittance of bond principal and interest payments. Additional information on the bonds’ payment schedules can be found in the District’s financial statements.  

## 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

**Basis of presentation** – The District accounts for its financial transactions in accordance with the policies and procedures of the California Department of Education's California School Accounting Manual. The accounting policies of the District conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  

**Measurement focus and basis of accounting** – Measurement focus indicates the type of resources being measured, while the basis of accounting indicates the timing of transactions or events for recognition in the financial statements. The Measure J Building Fund is a governmental fund, and has been presented using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available, and are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the District considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Expenditures are generally recorded when the related liability is incurred.  

**Cash and cash equivalents** – For the purpose of the financial statements, cash equivalents are defined as financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less.  

**Restricted cash and cash equivalents** – Cash that is externally restricted to purchase or construct capital or other assets is classified as a restricted asset in the balance sheets.  

**Restricted fund balance** – Restricted fund balance includes resources which are legally or contractually restricted by external third parties. Fund balance is restricted for capital projects of the Measure J Building Fund in accordance with the project list for the 2002 General Obligation Bonds.  

**Estimates used in financial reporting** – In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

### 3. RESTRICTED CASH AND EQUIVALENTS  

Cash and equivalents as of June 30, 2021, consist of the following:  

- Cash and equivalents with County Treasury: $ 3,554,060  
- Cash and equivalents with fiscal agents: $ 1,863  
- **Total cash and equivalents:** $ 3,555,923  

**Cash and equivalents in County Treasury** – The Measure J Building Fund maintains cash in the Sacramento County Treasury (the Treasury). The Treasury pools funds with those of other districts in the county and invests the cash. The share of each fund in the pooled cash account is separately accounted for and interest earned is apportioned quarterly based on the relationship of a fund’s daily balance to the total of pooled cash and investments.  

Participants’ equity in the Treasury investment pool is determined by the dollar amount of the participant deposits, adjusted for withdrawals and distributed income.  

The Treasury is authorized to deposit cash and invest excess funds by California Government Code Section 53648 et seq. and is restricted by Government Code Section 53635, pursuant to Section 53601.  

**Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent** – Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent are held by the Treasury and represent bond proceeds restricted for capital projects.  

**Derivative investments** – The Measure J Building Fund did not directly enter into any derivative investments. Information regarding the amount invested in derivatives by the Treasury was not available.  

**Interest rate risk** – Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to changes in market interest rates. As of June 30, 2021, weighted average maturity of the investments contained in the Treasury is approximately 300 days.  

**Credit risk** – Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. This is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The Treasury investment pool does not have a rating provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  

**Custodial credit risk** – Custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, a government will not be able to recover its deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. The California Education Code and the District’s investment policy do not contain legal or policy requirements that would limit the exposure to custodial credit risk for deposits other than the following provision for deposits: The California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits that are made by state or local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral pool held by a depository regulated under state law (unless so waived by the governmental unit). The market value of the pledged securities in the collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total amounts deposited by the public agencies.

4. **INTERFUND TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER DISTRICT FUNDS**  

Transfers to and from other District Funds are operating transfers from a fund receiving revenue to a fund through which the resources are being expended. The significant transfers to and from other District Funds were as follows for the year ended June 30, 2021:

- The District’s County Schools State Schools Facilities Fund transferred $615,909 to the Measure J Building Fund for the Sylvan modernization project.  

5. **COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**

In the opinion of management, the amount of the ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Measure J Building Fund.  

As of June 30, 2021, the Measure J Building Fund has approximately $1.9 million in outstanding commitments on ongoing construction contracts.

# REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

## Independent Auditor’s Report

**Independent Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee**  
**and Board of Education**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Carmichael, California**

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the Measure J Building Fund of the San Juan Unified School District (the District), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated March 11, 2022.

## Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

**Compliance and Other Matters**

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Measure J Building Fund’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Purpose of this Report**

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

**Board of Education and Independent Citizens’ Bond**  
**Oversight Committee for Measure J**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Carmichael, California**

We have conducted a performance audit of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) Measure J General Obligation Bonds for the year ended June 30, 2021.

We conducted our performance audit in accordance with **Government Auditing Standards** issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for the findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Our audit was limited to the objectives listed on page 2 of this report which includes determining compliance with the performance requirements for the Proposition 39 and Measure J General Obligation Bonds under the applicable provisions of Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution and Proposition 39 as they apply to the bonds and the net proceeds thereof. Management is responsible for the District’s compliance with those requirements.

Solely to assist us in planning and performing our performance audit, we obtained an understanding of the internal controls of the District to determine if internal controls were adequate to help ensure the District’s compliance with the requirements of Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution. Accordingly, we do not express any assurance on the internal controls.

The results of our tests indicated that, in all significant respects, the San Juan Unified School District expended Measure J General Obligation Bond funds for the year ended June 30, 2021 only for the specific projects developed by the District’s Board of Trustees and approved by the voters, in accordance with the requirements of Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution.

**PROCEDURES PERFORMED**

We obtained the Measure J Building Fund detailed general ledger for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.

**and Board of Education**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Carmichael, California**  

**Report on the Financial Statements**  

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Measure N Building Fund of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents.

**Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements**  

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditor’s Responsibility**  

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Measure N Building Fund of the District, as of June 30, 2021, and the changes in financial position thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Emphasis of Matter**

As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements present only the Measure N Building Fund and do not purport to, and do not present fairly the financial position of the District as of June 30, 2021, or the changes in its financial position for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

**Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards**

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated March 11, 2022 on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

The District currently operates 65 schools and provides early learning, kindergarten through 12th grade, and adult program education to approximately 40,000 students.  

These financial statements present only the Measure N General Obligation Bonds Building Fund, which is recorded in sub-Fund 24 (Measure N Building Fund) of Fund 21 (Building Fund) in the District's audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2021. These financial statements do not include financial data for the remainder of the District’s funds and component unit, which accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require to be presented with the financial statements of the District.  

On November 6, 2012, the electorate of the San Juan Unified School District approved the $350 million Measure N general obligation bonds with greater than 55% of the votes in favor.  

- On January 13, 2013, the District issued General Obligation Bonds Election of 2012, Series A (Series A Bonds) in the amount of $20,000,000 to build, acquire, construct, and furnish school facilities.

interest and principal of the Bonds when due. The District has established separate debt service funds to account for the collection and remittance of bond principal and interest payments. Additional information on the bonds’ payment schedules can be found in the District’s financial statements.

## 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

**Basis of presentation** – The District accounts for its financial transactions in accordance with the policies and procedures of the California Department of Education's California School Accounting Manual. The accounting policies of the District conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

**Measurement focus and basis of accounting** – Measurement focus indicates the type of resources being measured, while the basis of accounting indicates the timing of transactions or events for recognition in the financial statements. The Measure N Building Fund is a governmental fund, and has been presented using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available, and are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the District considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Expenditures are generally recorded when the related liability is incurred.

**Cash and cash equivalents** – For the purpose of the financial statements, cash equivalents are defined as financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less.

**Restricted cash and cash equivalents** – Cash that is externally restricted to purchase or construct capital or other assets is classified as a restricted asset in the balance sheet.

**Restricted fund balance** – Restricted fund balance includes resources which are legally or contractually restricted by external third parties. Fund balance is restricted for capital projects of the Measure N Building Fund in accordance with the project list for the 2012 General Obligation Bonds.

**Estimates used in financial reporting** – In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

### 3. RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  

Cash and equivalents as of June 30, 2021, consist of the following:  

- Cash and equivalents with County Treasury  $ 20,842,954  
- Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent  $ 14,935,837  
- **Total cash and equivalents**  $ 35,778,791  

**Cash and equivalents in County Treasury** – The Measure N Building Fund maintains cash in the Sacramento County Treasury (the Treasury). The Treasury pools funds with those of other districts in the county and invests the cash. The share of each fund in the pooled cash account is separately accounted for and interest earned is apportioned quarterly based on the relationship of a fund’s daily balance to the total of pooled cash and investments.  

Participants’ equity in the Treasury investment pool is determined by the dollar amount of the participant deposits, adjusted for withdrawals and distributed income.  

The Treasury is authorized to deposit cash and invest excess funds by California Government Code Section 53648 et seq. and is restricted by Government Code Section 53651, pursuant to Section 53601.  

**Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent** – Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent are held by the Treasury and represent bond proceeds restricted for capital projects.  

**Derivative investments** – The Measure N Building Fund did not directly enter into any derivative investments. Information regarding the amount invested in derivatives by the Treasury was not available.  

**Interest rate risk** – Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to changes in market interest rates. As of June 30, 2021, weighted average maturity of the investments contained in the Treasury is approximately 300 days.  

**Credit risk** – Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. This is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The Treasury investment pool does not have a rating provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  

**Custodial credit risk** – Custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, a government will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. The California Education Code and the District’s investment policy do not contain legal or policy requirements that would limit the exposure to custodial credit risk for deposits other than the following provision for deposits: the California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits that are made by state or local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral pool held by a depository regulated under state law (unless so waived by the governmental unit). The market value of the pledged securities in the collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total amounts deposited by the public agencies.

4. **INTERFUND TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER DISTRICT FUNDS**  

Transfers to and from other District Funds are operating transfers from a fund receiving revenue to a fund through which the resources are being expended. Transfers in from other District Funds were as follows for the year ended June 30, 2021:  

The District’s County State Schools Facilities Fund transferred $1,556,985 to the Measure N Building Fund for the Casa Roble High School modernization project.  

5. **COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**  

The District is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of the ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Measure N Building Fund.  

As of June 30, 2021, the Measure N Building Fund has approximately $19 million in outstanding commitments on ongoing construction contracts.

# REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

## Independent Auditor’s Report

**Independent Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee and Board of Education**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Carmichael, California**

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the Measure N Building Fund of the San Juan Unified School District (the District), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated March 11, 2022.

## Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

**Compliance and Other Matters**

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Measure N Building Fund’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Purpose of this Report**

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

**Board of Education and Independent Citizens’ Bond**  
**Oversight Committee for Measure N**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Carmichael, California**

We have conducted a performance audit of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) Measure N General Obligation Bonds for the year ended June 30, 2021.

We conducted our performance audit in accordance with **Government Auditing Standards** issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for the findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Our audit was limited to the objectives listed on page 2 of this report which includes determining compliance with the performance requirements for the Proposition 39 and Measure N General Obligation Bonds under the applicable provisions of Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution and Proposition 39 as they apply to the bonds and the net proceeds thereof. Management is responsible for the District’s compliance with those requirements.

Solely to assist us in planning and performing our performance audit, we obtained an understanding of the internal controls of the District to determine if internal controls were adequate to help ensure the District’s compliance with the requirements of Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution. Accordingly, we do not express any assurance on the internal controls.

The results of our tests indicated that, in all significant respects, the San Juan Unified School District expended Measure N General Obligation Bond funds for the year ended June 30, 2021 only for the specific projects developed by the District’s Board of Trustees and approved by the voters, in accordance with the requirements of Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution.

The financial activity related to the Measure N General Obligation Bonds is recorded in sub-Fund 24 (Measure N Building Fund) of Fund 21 (Building Fund) in the District's audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2021.

**PROCEDURES PERFORMED**

We obtained the Measure N Building Fund detailed general ledger for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. We obtained the actual invoices and other supporting documentation for a sample of expenditures to ensure compliance with Proposition 39 and Measure N General Obligation Bond funding. We performed the following procedures:

- We verified the mathematical accuracy of the expenditures included in the Measure N Building Fund detailed general ledger for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.

- We reconciled the total expenditures as reported in the detailed general ledger of the Measure N Building Fund for the year ended June 30, 2021 to the District’s audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2021.

- Solely to assist us in planning and performing our performance audit, we obtained an understanding of the internal controls of the District to determine if internal controls are adequate to help ensure the District’s compliance with the requirements of Proposition 39.

- We determined that the Independent Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee is fulfilling its duties as required by Education Code 15278 and as outlined in their Committee Bylaws.

- We selected a sample of 46 expenditures in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The sample was selected to provide a representation across construction projects, vendors, and expenditure amounts. For each selection, we performed the following procedures:

  1. Reviewed supporting documentation to ensure that funds were properly expended on the specific projects outlined on the publicized list and met the requirements for bidding, if applicable.

  2. Verified the expenditure was for construction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, including furnishing and equipping of District facilities, deferred maintenance upgrades or the acquisition or lease of real property facilities and verified that funding was not used for salaries of school administrators or other operating expenditures of the District.

The District incurred total expenditures of $45,492,768 through June 30, 2021, for the Measure N projects listed in the following Schedule of Activities.

**CONCLUSION**

Based upon the procedures performed, we found that, for the items tested, the San Juan Unified School District has properly accounted for the expenditures of the Measure N General Obligation Bonds. Further, it was noted that the funds were not used for salaries of school administrators or other operating expenditures. Our audit does not provide a legal determination on the District’s compliance with specific requirements.

**MANAGEMENT COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

None.

**Independent Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee**  
**and Board of Education**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Carmichael, California**  

**Report on the Financial Statements**  

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Measure P Building Fund of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents.

**Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements**  

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditor’s Responsibility**  

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Measure P Building Fund of the District, as of June 30, 2021, and the changes in financial position thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Emphasis of Matter**

As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements present only the Measure P Building Fund and do not purport to, and do not present fairly the financial position of the District as of June 30, 2021, or the changes in its financial position for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

**Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards**

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated March 11, 2022, on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

## MEASURE P BUILDING FUND  
### NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### JUNE 30, 2021  

1. **ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF ACTIVITIES**  

   The San Juan Unified School District (the District) was established in 1960 and serves a 75-square mile area covering the communities of Arden-Arcade, Carmichael, Citrus Heights, Fair Oaks, Gold River, and Orangevale. The District currently operates 65 schools and provides early learning, kindergarten through 12th grade, and adult program education to approximately 40,000 students.  

   These financial statements present only the Measure P General Obligation Bonds Building Fund, which is recorded in sub-Fund 26 (Measure P Building Fund) of Fund 21 (Building Fund) in the District's audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2021. These financial statements do not include financial data for the remainder of the District’s funds and component unit, which accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require to be presented with the financial statements of the District.  

   On November 8, 2016, the electorate of the San Juan Unified School District approved the $750 million Measure P general obligation bonds with greater than 55% of the votes in favor.  

   - On March 7, 2017, the District issued General Obligation Bonds Election of 2016 (Series 2017 Bonds) in the amount of $39,920,000 to finance specific construction, acquisition, and modernization projects. These bonds mature during succeeding years through August 2019, and were issued at interest rates ranging from 2.00% to 2.50%.  

   - On January 22, 2019, the District issued General Obligation Bonds of Election 2016 (Series 2019 Bonds) in the amount of $80,000,000 to finance specific construction, acquisition, and modernization projects. These bonds mature during succeeding years through August 2029 and were issued at 4.00% interest rate.  

   - On October 29, 2020, the District issued General Obligation Bonds, Election 2016, Series 2020 in the amount of $150,000,000. The bonds range in maturity date with final payoff on August 1, 2041 and interest rates ranging from 0.25% - 4.00%.  

   As of June 30, 2021, total outstanding debt related to Measure P is $202,560,000.  

   The Board of Supervisors of Sacramento County is empowered and obligated to annually levy ad valorem taxes, without limitation as to rate or amount, upon all property subject to taxation within the District (except for certain property which is taxable at limited rates), for payment of interest and principal of the Bonds when due. The District has established separate debt service funds to account for the collection and remittance of bond principal and interest payments. Additional information on the bonds’ payment schedules can be found in the District’s financial statements.  

2. **SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**  

   **Basis of presentation** – The District accounts for its financial transactions in accordance with the policies and procedures of the California Department of Education's California School Accounting Manual. The accounting policies of the District conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  
<!-- Page 99 -->
# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## MEASURE P BUILDING FUND  
### NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### JUNE 30, 2021  

**Measurement focus and basis of accounting** – Measurement focus indicates the type of resources being measured, while the basis of accounting indicates the timing of transactions or events for recognition in the financial statements. The Measure P Building Fund is a governmental fund, and has been presented using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available, and are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the District considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Expenditures are generally recorded when the related liability is incurred.

**Cash and cash equivalents** – For the purpose of the financial statements, cash equivalents are defined as financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less.

**Restricted cash and cash equivalents** – Cash that is externally restricted to purchase or construct capital or other assets is classified as a restricted asset in the balance sheet.

**Restricted fund balance** – Restricted fund balance includes resources which are legally or contractually restricted by external third parties. Fund balance is restricted for capital projects of the Measure P Building Fund in accordance with the project list for the 2016 General Obligation Bonds.

**Estimates used in financial reporting** – In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

### 3. RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  

Cash and equivalents as of June 30, 2021, consist of the following:

- Cash and equivalents with County Treasury: $ 20,049,889  
- Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent: $ 105,906,602  

**Total cash and equivalents**: $ 125,956,491  

**Cash and equivalents in County Treasury** – The Measure P Building Fund maintains cash in the Sacramento County Treasury (the Treasury). The Treasury pools funds with those of other districts in the county and invests the cash. The share of each fund in the pooled cash account is separately accounted for and interest earned is apportioned quarterly based on the relationship of a fund’s daily balance to the total of pooled cash and investments.

Participants’ equity in the Treasury investment pool is determined by the dollar amount of the participant deposits, adjusted for withdrawals and distributed income.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## MEASURE P BUILDING FUND  
### NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### JUNE 30, 2021  

The Treasury is authorized to deposit cash and invest excess funds by California Government Code Section 53648 et seq. and is restricted by Government Code Section 53635, pursuant to Section 53601.  

**Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent** – Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent are held by the Treasury and represent bond proceeds restricted for capital projects.  

**Derivative investments** – The Measure P Building Fund did not directly enter into any derivative investments. Information regarding the amount invested in derivatives by the Treasury was not available.  

**Interest rate risk** – Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to changes in market interest rates. As of June 30, 2021, weighted average maturity of the investments contained in the Treasury is approximately 300 days.  

**Credit risk** – Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. This is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The Treasury investment pool does have a rating provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  

**Custodial credit risk** – Custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, a government will not be able to recover its deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. The California Education Code and the District’s investment policy do not contain legal or policy requirements that would limit the exposure to custodial credit risk for deposits other than the following provision for deposits: the California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits that are made by state or local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral pool held by a depository regulated under state law (unless so waived by the governmental unit). The market value of the pledged securities in the collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total amounts deposited by the public agencies.  

### 4. INTERFUND TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER DISTRICT FUNDS  

Transfers to and from other District Funds are operating transfers from a fund receiving revenue to a fund through which the resources are being expended. Transfers in from other District Funds were as follows for the year ended June 30, 2021:  

The District’s General Fund transferred $366,748 to the Measure P Building Fund for E-Rate USAC Bear Funding.

5. **COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**  

The District is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of the ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Measure P Building Fund.  

As of June 30, 2021, the Measure P Building Fund has approximately $84 million in outstanding commitments and construction contracts.

# REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

## Independent Auditor’s Report

**Independent Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee and Board of Education**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Carmichael, California**

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the Measure P Building Fund of the San Juan Unified School District (the District), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated March 11, 2022.

### Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

**Compliance and Other Matters**

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Measure P Building Fund’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Purpose of this Report**

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

Board of Education and Independent Citizens’ Bond  
Oversight Committee for Measure P  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

We have conducted a performance audit of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) Measure P General Obligation Bonds for the year ended June 30, 2021.

We conducted our performance audit in accordance with Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for the findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Our audit was limited to the objectives listed on page 2 of this report which includes determining compliance with the performance requirements for the Proposition 39 and Measure P General Obligation Bonds under the applicable provisions of Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution and Proposition 39 as they apply to the bonds and the net proceeds thereof. Management is responsible for the District’s compliance with those requirements.

Solely to assist us in planning and performing our performance audit, we obtained an understanding of the internal controls of the District to determine if internal controls were adequate to help ensure the District’s compliance with the requirements of Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution. Accordingly, we do not express any assurance on the internal controls.

The results of our tests indicated that, in all significant respects, the San Juan Unified School District expended Measure P General Obligation Bond funds for the year ended June 30, 2021 only for specific projects developed by the District’s Board of Trustees and approved by the voters, in accordance with the requirements of Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution.

## PROCEDURES PERFORMED

We obtained the Measure P Building Fund detailed general ledger for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. We obtained the actual invoices and other supporting documentation for a sample of expenditures to ensure compliance with Proposition 39 and Measure P General Obligation Bond funding. We performed the following procedures:

- We verified the mathematical accuracy of the expenditures included in the Measure P Building Fund detailed general ledger for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.

- We reconciled the total expenditures as reported in the detailed general ledger of the Measure P Building Fund for the year ended June 30, 2021 to the District’s audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2021.

- Solely to assist us in planning and performing our performance audit, we obtained an understanding of the internal controls of the District to determine if internal controls are adequate to help ensure the District’s compliance with the requirements of Proposition 39.

- We determined that the Independent Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee is fulfilling its duties as required by Education Code 15278 and as outlined in their Committee Bylaws.

- We selected a sample of 27 expenditures in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The sample was selected to provide a representation across construction projects, vendors and expenditure amounts. For each selection, we performed the following procedures:

  1. Reviewed supporting documentation to ensure that funds were properly expended on the specific projects outlined on the publicized list and met the requirements for bidding, if applicable.

  2. Verified the expenditure was for construction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, including furnishing and equipping of District facilities, deferred maintenance upgrades or the acquisition or lease of real property facilities and verified that funding was not used for salaries of school administrators or other operating expenditures of the District.

The District incurred total expenditures of $73,787,422 through June 30, 2021, for the Measure P projects listed in the following Schedule of Activities.

**Environmental Science (A-G):**  
Environment Science is a lab-based college preparatory course designed to investigate the role of humans in their environment through the use of project-based investigation, modeling, coursework, lab work, and fieldwork. Students will develop an understanding of environmental science through project-based units connected to their environment. Emphasis will be placed on resources management for a sustainable future and critical thinking skills to make informed decisions concerning complex environmental issues. The course is comprised of a series of units that each connect to a local and/or global environmental phenomena and concerns. The goal is to facilitate students’ engagement with science and engineering practices to investigate the dynamic interaction that occurs between the chemical, physical, geological, and biological components of the Earth's environment; and to explore how humans interact, influence, and depend upon it. (“d”) (District)

**Mural Design (A-G):**  
Mural Design is a course that expands student creativity, collaboration and leadership skills, and the social application of art in profound ways. Each semester is divided up into intensive investigations and applications of the mural creating process, which includes building fine art skills, finding individual and collective artistic voices, creating, and defending work at a public exhibition, and collaborating in groups to execute an interior or exterior mural. Students will study techniques in drawing and painting, beginning the year with human portraits, then transition into small group paintings on canvas that will be housed in a public venue for an exhibition, and finally work together in larger groups to create a design for a mural that will be painted within the school or surrounding community. Each production of art includes an artist statement written by each student to explain the meaning of the work, make connections to other influences and artistic movements, and help express personal beliefs and ideas on greater social issues. (“f”) (Encina)

**College and Career Readiness (A-G):**  
College and Career Readiness is designed to aid students in making and achieving their post-secondary goals. Emphasis is placed on research and exploration while building digital literacy, critical thinking, and college-level writing skills. Resumes, college applications, interview skills, and budgeting are all part of the integrated, inter-disciplinary curriculum. (“g”) (Del Campo)

03/11/2022  
Unless otherwise indicated, successful completion for a course is a C- or better.

San Juan Unified’s Technology Services is powered by just more than 50 passionate professionals working in five teams. This year also began with establishing a lead for each team which we are proud to share were all recruited from internal candidates within the department.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related challenges, our teams deployed several technology solutions to support continued in-person and remote learning. The district’s portal was replaced to provide more stable access while a new product known as Clever allowed us to simplify how our students and staff gain access to a repository of learning resources. More than 20,000 Chromebooks remain deployed to students from the 2020/21 school year along with 2,100 hot spots. Support has been a large part of our work during the pandemic both for the devices deployed as well as calls for assistance. The team has reorganized and focused its processes resulting in more than 87 percent of help desk calls being answered in person.

The Networking and Applications Support team has been instrumental in several efforts this year including upgrades to our infrastructure and deployment of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to keep data and services secure. The Student Information Support team has worked to implement upgrades to the system while also supporting San Juan Central’s successful completion of this year’s open enrollment lottery. Our Help Desk and Desktop Support team handles the deployment, repair and troubleshooting of devices and has been especially busy this year supporting technology deployments in the remodeling of Katherine Johnson Middle School’s office and delivering more than 500 Chromebook carts to schools. Business Systems Support has kept the software powering our human resources, payroll and other business systems functioning with four major updates in the last year and developing a new requisition routing process with the purchasing department. And, the Applications and Architecture and Design team was instrumental in developing solutions that allowed the district to manage COVID-19 cases and share updates via the COVID-19 dashboard with our community.

The department also has a number of high profile projects underway including support for Smooth Start this fall, exploration of a document management system, roll-out of new enrollment software, implementation of cyber security training, beginning deployment of a new financial and employee system, updates to technology in the board room, improved network connectiveness at a number of elementary and middle schools and assisting early childhood education (ECE) with its new registration.

**HOW DO WE DO IT?**  
**AS FRED'S**  

**THE MISSION: BE A FRED**  
**THE FOUR PRINCIPLES**  
1. Everyone Makes a Difference.  
   At the end of the day, what kind of difference did you make?  
2. Everything is Built on Relationships.  
   Go beyond simple interacting to build relationships.  
3. Continually Create Value for Others.  
   Replace money with imagination—outthink your competition rather than outspend them.  
4. Reinvent Yourself Regularly.  
   You wake up every morning with a blank slate. Make your business and your life anything you choose.
