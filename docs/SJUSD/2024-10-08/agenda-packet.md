need of support. Ms. Knifton-Foley shared information about the Attendance Academy intervention pilot program, which is expanding to additional school sites for the 2024-2025 school year.

Mr. Field-Ridley shared information about the purpose of the land acknowledgement, the process that has been implemented to collaboratively develop a land acknowledgement in partnership with local tribes and the district’s American Indian Education Program Parent Advisory Committee (AIEP PAC), and the land acknowledgement statement that was developed. Dr. Oaxaca presented next steps.

**Visitor Comments:**  
Pyrose Bernasconi expressed support for the land acknowledgement.

Kelly Bencken expressed support for the land acknowledgement.  
Kameiko Hostler expressed support for the land acknowledgement.

After public comment, board members engaged in discussion. Ms. Villescaz expressed her support for the land acknowledgement, encouraging genuine implementation rather than simply reciting recorded land acknowledgements and recognizes their importance to the community. Ms. Kravchuk emphasized the need to consider the process, asking about the parameters for such acknowledgments and how decisions are made if others groups make a similar request, and she inquired about how the land acknowledgement could become more of a learning experience. Mr. Avey inquired about the district’s current History-Social Science curriculum specifically related to the teaching of Native American history, which Director of Professional Learning and Innovation, Nicole Kukral, addressed. Mr. Avey made comments regarding educating students about America’s past. While Mr. Avey expressed support for the land acknowledgement statement, he questioned how it should be implemented, whether it should be included only at the annual organizational meeting or at every board meeting. Ms. Creason expressed support for moving forward with the land acknowledgement, stating that implementing this is a simple, yet meaningful way to restore justice, and she expressed gratitude to the community for their efforts. Mr. Hernandez expressed his support for the land acknowledgement and noted his efforts to recognize the AIEP PAC. Mr. Hernandez wondered if the land acknowledgment might get diluted if it is read frequently, and he suggested reading it at the first and last meetings of the year, as well as at high school graduations, and printing it in the agenda. Mr. Perez expressed support for the land acknowledgement statement, but shared that he is uncertain whether it should be implemented at every board meeting or just at the first and last meetings, and high school graduations. Superintendent Bassanelli explained how the item was originally agreed upon using the process outlined in the Governance Handbook. Ms. Kravchuk reiterated her concerns regarding how future requests from other groups would be handled. Mr. Avey said he believes it is at the discretion of the board to consider each request. Ms. Villescaz concurred that the same process would be repeated for future requests, unless new rules are adopted as part of the Governance Handbook. Ms. Villescaz expressed support for the implementation compromise regarding the cadence of meetings. Ms. Creason requested community feedback on the frequency change. Ms. Villescaz asked a question about the number of tribes listed in the resolution, which Indian Education School Community Worker, Samantha Manriquez, addressed. Ms. Costa thanked the community for its input, expressed support for the land acknowledgement statement and confirmed with Superintendent Bassanelli that enough information had been provided to proceed with fine-tuning the recommendation for further discussion and possible action on October 22.

The board took a recess at 8:25 p.m. due to a medical emergency in the board room. The meeting resumed at 8:52 p.m.

# Resolution No. A-442  
**WEEK OF THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR**  
**October 13 – 19, 2024**  

**WHEREAS**, leadership matters for California’s public education system and the more than 6 million students it serves. School administrators are passionate, lifelong learners who believe in the value of quality public education. Providing quality service for student success is paramount for the profession; and  

**WHEREAS**, the title “school administrator” is a broad term used to define many education leadership posts. Superintendents, assistant superintendents, principals, assistant principals, special education and adult education leaders, curriculum and assessment leaders, school business officials, classified educational leaders and other school district employees are considered administrators; and  

**WHEREAS**, most school administrators began their careers as teachers. The average administrator has served in public education for more than a decade. Most of California’s superintendents have served in education for more than 20 years. Such experience is beneficial in their work to effectively and efficiently lead public education and improve student achievement; and  

**WHEREAS**, public schools operate with lean management systems. Across the nation, public schools employ fewer managers and supervisors than most public and private sector industries including transportation, food service, manufacturing, utilities, construction, publishing and public administration; and  

**WHEREAS**, school leaders depend on a network of support from school communities – fellow administrators, teachers, parents, students, businesses, community members, board trustees, colleges and universities, community and faith-based organizations, elected officials and district and county staff and resources – to promote ongoing student achievement and school success; and  

**WHEREAS**, research shows great schools are led by great principals, and great districts are led by great superintendents. These site leaders are supported by extensive administrative networks throughout the state. The future of California’s public education system depends upon the quality of its leadership; now therefore  

**BE IT RESOLVED**, by the San Juan Unified School District Board of Education, that it recognizes the week of October 13 - 19, 2024, as the Week of the School Administrator in honor of the many outstanding contributions and services provided by school administrators in the San Juan Unified School District; and  

**BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED** that the district commends San Juan Unified School District administrators for their support of and their contributions to quality education for students.

### AGENDA ITEM: H.5  
### MEETING DATE: 10/08/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Resolution No. 4149 Commit Fund Balance  
**DEPARTMENT:** Fiscal Services  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt Resolution No. 4149 to Commit Fund Balance.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The objective of GASB 54 is to enhance the usefulness of fund balance information by providing clearer fund balance classification that can be more consistently applied and by clarifying existing governmental fund type definitions. The district has identified expenditures to support various programs and initiatives that can be met with current fund balance commitments.  

On September 26, 2023, the board approved Resolution No. 4099 to commit funds. The amounts have been revised to reflect updated information and were increased to cover projected expenditures. Supplemental funds were increased to reflect the ending balance as of unaudited actuals.

## RESOLUTION NO. 4149

### RESOLUTION OF THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO COMMIT FUND BALANCE

WHEREAS, the Governmental Standards Accounting Board (GASB) has issued Statement No. 54, establishing a hierarchy clarifying constraints that govern how a government entity can use amounts reported as fund balance; and

WHEREAS, the committed fund balance classification reflects amounts subject to specific internal constraints self-imposed by the Board; and

WHEREAS, once the committed fund-balance constraints are imposed, it requires the constraint to be revised, removed or redirected for other purposes by the Board in the same manner as the Board originally approved the commitment; and

WHEREAS, the Board has determined it has specific needs that it elects to fund with portions of its General Fund ending fund balance.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the San Juan Unified School District Board of Education, hereby commits to utilizing portions of its general fund ending balance, as indicated by the committed fund classification in its financial statements, for the following purposes:

| Purpose                                         | Justification                                           | Estimated Amount  |

### AGENDA ITEM: H.6  
### MEETING DATE: 10/08/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Northridge Elementary School 2024 Site Security Project CEQA Categorical Exemption  

**DEPARTMENT:** Operations  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) notice of exemption for the Northridge Elementary School 2024 site security project.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Northridge Elementary 5150 Cocoa Palm Way (APN: 249-0232-006), in Fair Oaks, California. The project area spans approximately 1.1 acres and is composed of 1,975.3 feet of primarily paved, landscaped, and recreational areas within the boundaries. The project scope generally includes the removal of several apparatuses; the replacement of asphalt on the hardcourt playground, and the addition of gates and site fencing along the school frontage, mostly adjacent to the northern and southern campus boundaries.  

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

Northridge Elementary School 2024 Site Security Project  
CEQA Categorical Exemption  
Terracon Project No: NB247028  

---

**Project Information:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Northridge Elementary School’s campus at 5150 Cocoa Palm Way (APN: 249-0232-006), in Fair Oaks, California. The project area spans approximately 1.1 acres and is composed of 1,975.3 feet of primarily paved, landscaped, and recreational areas within the school’s boundaries (Exhibit 1). Then project scope generally includes the removal of several apparatuses; the replacement of asphalt on the hardcourt playground, and the addition of gates and fencing along the school frontage, mostly adjacent to the northern and southern campus boundaries.

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

---

**Legal Setting:**  
Categorical Exemptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300)  
Projects that are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact may be Categorically Exempt from California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review. As described in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300, Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires these guidelines to include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. In response to that mandate, the Secretary for Resources has found that the following classes of projects listed in this article do not have a significant effect on the environment, and they are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.

Like many school-maintenance projects (that do not involve additional classrooms or student capacity), the proposed project is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts under CEQA.

Table 1 provides an abbreviated CEQA checklist, explaining why the implementation of the proposed project would not result in any significant environmental impacts.

### Table 1. Abbreviated CEQA Environmental Checklist

| Impact Category                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aesthetics                     | The project would not result in impacts related to scenic vistas, state-listed scenic highways. The proposed project would not require the installation of equipment that would be inconsistent with previous conditions; and would not result in an impact on Aesthetics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Agriculture and Forestry Resources | The proposed project would not involve agricultural lands or Prime Farmland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Air Quality                    | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of pollutants or odors to sensitive receptors. Although Sacramento County is in nonattainment status for PM-2.5 (2006) and 8-Hour Ozone (2015) criteria pollutants, the proposed project would not result in a significant net increase of such pollutants as the emissions would be associated with the limited use of construction equipment, nor would the project conflict with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)’s ability to comply with any applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP). |
| Biological Resources           | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), Natural Community Conservation Planning (NCCP), or other sensitive biological resources. The school campus is not expected to contain Sambucus sp.; however, if present and if any are required to be removed, a pre-construction survey will be necessary to ensure habitat for Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle habitat is not present. Additional project commitments include a pre-construction nesting bird survey or limiting tree removal to outside of the migratory period to avoid non-compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If active nests are to be found during a nesting bird survey, no-work buffer areas would be established in consultation with California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). |
| Cultural Resources             | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not suspected to contain archeological artifacts as the area is previously disturbed. If archeological or cultural resources are discovered onsite, work would cease immediately until consultation and approval to continue work was provided by a qualified archeologist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|-------------------|---------------|
| **Energy** | The proposed project would not result in an impact related to the wasteful or inefficient use of energy since the project will not require the use of equipment with an energy requirement during its operation. |
| **Geology and Soils** | The proposed project would not result in geological impacts. The project construction would take place on existing hardcourt and would not result in new construction in unsafe soils. |
| **Greenhouse Gas Emissions** | Although greenhouse gases would be emitted during project construction, it would not result in a significant impact on the environment, nor would it conflict with a plan, policy, or regulation aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. |
| **Hazards and Hazardous Materials** | The proposed project would not involve the use or release of potentially hazardous substances. Abatement of Hazardous Materials Plan (AHMP) will be created prior to project construction to handle potential unexpected encounters with hazardous materials. |
| **Hydrology and Water Quality** | Local water quality impacts would be avoided by the use of routing stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) during construction and material staging activities. |
| **Land Use and Planning** | The proposed project would not divide an established community, nor would it result in a conflict with a land use plan or zoning ordinance as the project does not modify the existing land use. |
| **Mineral Resources** | The proposed project would not require the extraction of Mineral Resources. |
| **Noise** | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of excessive noise levels. Construction would not take place during the school year. Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts. |
| **Population and Housing** | The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth. |
| **Public Services** | The proposed project would not negatively affect public services, but instead would improve the high school’s ability to provide security for their students. |

| **Recreation** | The proposed project would not lead to the deterioration of existing recreational facilities, but instead would enhance existing recreational opportunities. The project would not involve the construction of new facilities that would result in an adverse physical environmental consequence. |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transportation** | The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation, because construction would occur outside of the school year when student traffic patterns would not be affected by the work. |
| **Tribal Cultural Resources** | The proposed project would not have the capability to impact a listed or eligible resource as there are no known ties to the site; however, if resources are discovered during ground disturbing activities, work will cease immediately and federally and state recognized tribes will be contacted. |
| **Wildfire** | The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards since the project will not increase fire loading. |
| **Mandatory Findings of Significance** | The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species or impact known resources. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact. |

### Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located – a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.

<!-- Page 31 -->
(e) Hazardous Waste Sites. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

**Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs.tit. 14 § 15314)**  
Class 14 projects are described in § 15314 as “minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less.” The project would take place entirely within Northridge Elementary School’s existing property and would not involve the addition of any new classrooms, nor would it affect the school’s student capacity. The proposed project fits the description provided in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314.

**Summary:**  
The proposed project would not result in any significant impacts to the environment (please see Table 1). The activities that make up the proposed project (replacing existing asphalt, installation of gates and fencing, vegetation removal, landscaping, etc.) meet both the description of a Class 14-exempt project as well as the criteria listed in the Exceptions to CEQA Categorical Exemptions. The project area is not located on a hazard waste site or other environmental feature of critical concern. The proposed project would not result in a significant impact, nor would it result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant cumulative impact.

The long-term effects of the project are likely to be beneficial for the safety and functionality of the school. The project site is not in the vicinity of a Scenic Highway, and the project would not be expected to impact historical resources. No historic properties are known to exist in the project area; if artifacts were to be found during construction, work would stop immediately, and a qualified archeologist would be consulted with before work were to resume.

Avoidance and minimization measures would be incorporated to avoid impacts to biological resources. Such measures include limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting season (Feb 1 through Aug 31). Alternatively, if vegetation removal was needed during the nesting period, a nesting bird survey would be required. If nesting or migratory birds were found, the San Juan Unified School District would be responsible for establishing no-work buffers, as necessary, with the input of CDFW, before the commencement of construction or tree removal activities.

Considering the data summarized in this memorandum, it is Terracon’s opinion that the Northridge Elementary School 2024 Site Security and Hardcourt Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA documentation.

**RE:**  
Oakview Community Elementary School 2024 Site Security Project  
CEQA Categorical Exemption  
Terracon Project No: NB247027  

---

**Project Information:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Oakview Elementary School’s campus at 7229 Beech Avenue (APN: 213-0013-004), in Orangevale, California. The project area spans approximately 1.4 acres and includes 506 feet of primarily paved, landscaped, and recreational areas within the school’s boundaries (Exhibit 1). The project scope generally includes the replacement of asphalt on the hardcourt playground and fire road, repavement of bicycle rack area, removal of several fixtures, and the addition of gates and site fencing along the school frontage, particularly towards the eastern campus boundary.

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

---

**Legal Setting:**  
**Categorical Exemptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300)**  
Projects that are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact may be Categorically Exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review. As described in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300, Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires these guidelines to include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. In response to that mandate, the Secretary for Resources has found that the following classes of projects listed in this article do not have a significant effect on the environment, and they are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.

Like many school-maintenance projects (that do not involve additional classrooms or student capacity), the proposed project is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts under CEQA. Table 1 provides an abbreviated CEQA checklist, explaining why the implementation of the proposed project would not result in any significant environmental impacts.

# Table 1. Abbreviated CEQA Environmental Checklist

| Impact Category                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aesthetics                       | The project would not result in impacts related to scenic vistas, state-listed scenic highways. The proposed project would not require the installation of equipment that would be inconsistent with previous conditions; and would not result in an impact on Aesthetics.                                                                                          |
| Agriculture and Forestry Resources | The proposed project would not involve agricultural lands or Prime Farmland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Air Quality                      | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of pollutants or odors to sensitive receptors. Although Sacramento County is in nonattainment status for PM-2.5 (2006) and 8-Hour Ozone (2015) criteria pollutants, the proposed project would not result in a significant net increase of such pollutants as the emissions would be associated with the limited use of construction equipment, nor would the project conflict with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)’s ability to comply with any applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP). |
| Biological Resources             | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), Natural Community Conservation Planning (NCCP), or other sensitive biological resources. The school campus is not expected to contain Sambucus sp.; however, if present and if any are required to be removed, a pre-construction survey will be necessary to ensure habitat for Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle habitat is not present. Additional project commitments include a pre-construction nesting bird survey or limiting tree removal to outside of the migratory period to avoid non-compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If active nests are to be found during a nesting bird survey, no-work buffer areas would be established in consultation with California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). |
| Cultural Resources               | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not suspected to contain archeological artifacts as the project involves ground disturbance in areas previously disturbed. If archeological or cultural resources are discovered during construction, work will cease until a qualified professional can assess the significance of the find.                                                                                     |

|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Energy**                       | The proposed project would not result in an impact related to the wasteful or inefficient use of energy since the project will not require the use of equipment with an energy requirement during its operation.  |
| **Geology and Soils**           | The proposed project would not result in geological impacts. The project construction would take place on existing pavement and hardcourt and would not result in new construction in unsafe soils.                 |
| **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**     | Although greenhouse gases would be emitted during project construction, it would not result in a significant impact on the environment, nor would it conflict with a plan, policy, or regulation aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. |
| **Hazards and Hazardous Materials** | The proposed project would not involve the use or release of potentially hazardous substances. Abatement of Hazardous Materials Plan (AHMP) will be created prior to project construction to handle potential unexpected encounters with hazardous materials. |
| **Hydrology and Water Quality**  | Local water quality impacts would be avoided by the usage of routing stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) during construction and material staging activities.                                             |
| **Land Use and Planning**        | The proposed project would not divide an established community, nor would it result in a conflict with a land use plan or zoning ordinance as the project does not modify the existing land use.                   |
| **Mineral Resources**            | The proposed project would not require the extraction of Mineral Resources.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Noise**                        | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of excessive noise levels. Construction would not take place during the school year. Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts. |
| **Population and Housing**       | The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth.                                                                                                                                          |

**Public Services**  
The proposed project would not negatively affect public services, but instead would improve the high school’s ability to provide security for their students.

**Recreation**  
The proposed project would not lead to the deterioration of existing recreational facilities, but instead it would enhance existing recreational opportunities. The project would not involve the construction of new facilities that would result in an adverse physical environmental consequence.

**Transportation**  
The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation, because construction would occur outside of the school year when student traffic patterns would not be affected by the work.

**Tribal Cultural Resources**  
The proposed project would not impact a listed or eligible resource as there are no known ties to the site; however, if resources are discovered during ground disturbing activities, work will cease immediately and federally and state recognized tribes will be contacted.

**Wildfire**  
The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards since the project will not increase fire loading.

**Mandatory Findings of Significance**  
The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species or impact known resources. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact.

---

**Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)**  
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

**(a) Location.**  
Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located – a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

**(b) Cumulative Impact.**  
All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

**(c) Significant Effect.**  
A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

**(d) Scenic Highways.**  
A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar.

resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.

(e) Hazardous Waste Sites. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs.tit. 14 § 15314)  
Class 14 projects are described in § 15314 as “minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less.” The project would take place entirely within Oakview Community Elementary School’s existing property and would not involve the addition of any new classrooms, nor would it affect the school’s student capacity. The proposed project fits the description provided in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314.

Summary:  
The proposed project would not result in any significant impacts to the environment (please see Table 1). The activities that make up the proposed project (replacing existing asphalt, installation of gates and fencing, vegetation removal, landscaping, etc.) meet both the description of a Class 14-exempt project as well as the criteria listed in the Exceptions to CEQA Categorical Exemptions. The project area is not located on a hazardous waste site or other environmental feature of critical concern. The proposed project would not result in a significant impact, nor would it result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant cumulative impact.

The long-term effects of the project are likely to improve the safety and functionality of the school. The project site is not in the vicinity of a Scenic Highway, and the project would not be expected to impact historical resources. No historic properties are known to exist in the project area; if artifacts were to be found during construction, work would stop immediately, and a qualified archeologist would be consulted with before work were to resume.

Avoidance and minimization measure would be incorporated to avoid impacts to biological resources. Such measures include limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting season (Feb 1 through Aug 31). Alternatively, if vegetation removal was needed during the nesting period, a nesting bird survey would be required. If nesting or migratory birds were found, the San Juan Unified School District would be responsible for establishing no-work buffers, as necessary, with the input of CDFW, before the commencement of construction or tree removal activities.

Considering the data summarized in this memorandum, it is Terracon’s opinion that the Oakview Elementary School 2024 Site Security and Hardcourt Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA documentation.

| Biological Resources             | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), Natural Community Conservation Planning (NCCP), or other sensitive biological resources. The school campus is not expected to contain Sambucus sp.; however, if present and if any are required to be removed, a pre-construction survey will be necessary to ensure habitat for Valley Elderberry Longhorn Beetle habitat is not present. Additional project commitments include a pre-construction nesting bird survey or limiting tree removal to outside of the migratory period to avoid non-compliance with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. If active nests are to be found during a nesting bird survey, no-work buffer areas would be established in consultation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW). |
| Cultural Resources               | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not suspected to contain archeological artifacts as the area is previously disturbed. If archeological or cultural resources are discovered onsite, work would cease immediately until consultation and approval to continue work is provided by a qualified archeologist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|-------------------|---------------|
| **Energy** | The proposed project would not result in an impact related to the wasteful or inefficient use of energy since the project will not require the use of equipment with an energy requirement during its operation. |
| **Geology and Soils** | The proposed project would not result in geological impacts. The project construction would take place on existing hardcourt and would not result in new construction in unsafe soils. |
| **Greenhouse Gas Emissions** | Although greenhouse gases would be emitted during project construction, it would not result in a significant impact on the environment, nor would it conflict with a plan, policy, or regulation aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. |
| **Hazards and Hazardous Materials** | The proposed project would not involve the use or release of potentially hazardous substances. Abatement of Hazardous Materials Plan (AHMP) will be created prior to project construction to handle potential unexpected encounters with hazardous materials. |
| **Hydrology and Water Quality** | Local water quality impacts would be avoided by the usage of routing stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) during construction and material staging activities. |
| **Land Use and Planning** | The proposed project would not divide an established community, nor would it result in a conflict with a land use plan or zoning ordinance as the project does not modify the existing land use. |
| **Mineral Resources** | The proposed project would not require the extraction of Mineral Resources. |
| **Noise** | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of excessive noise levels. Construction would not take place during the school year. Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts. |
| **Population and Housing** | The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth. |
| **Public Services** | The proposed project would not negatively affect public services, but instead would improve the high school’s ability to provide security for their students. |

| **Recreation** | The proposed project would not lead to the deterioration of existing recreational facilities, but instead would enhance existing recreational opportunities. The project would not involve the construction of new facilities that would result in an adverse physical environmental consequence. |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Transportation** | The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation, because construction would occur outside of the school year when student traffic patterns would not be affected by the work. |
| **Tribal Cultural Resources** | The proposed project would not have the capability to impact a listed or eligible resource as there are no known ties to the site; however, if resources are discovered during ground disturbing activities, work will cease immediately and federally and state recognized tribes will be contacted. |
| **Wildfire** | The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards since the project will not increase fire loading. |
| **Mandatory Findings of Significance** | The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species or impact known resources. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact. |

### Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located – a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.

<!-- Page 47 -->
(e) Hazardous Waste Sites. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs.tit. 14 § 15314)  
Class 14 projects are described in § 15314 as “minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less.” The project would take place entirely within Cameron Ranch Elementary School’s existing property and would not involve the addition of any new classrooms, nor would it affect the school’s student capacity. The proposed project fits the description provided in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314.

Summary:  
The proposed project would not result in any significant impacts to the environment (please see Table 1). The activities that make up the proposed project (hardcourt replace, installation of gates and fencing, vegetation removal, landscaping, etc.) meet both the description of a Class 14-exempt project as well as the criteria listed in the Exceptions to CEQA Categorical Exemptions. The project area is not located on a hazard waste site or other environmental feature of critical concern. The proposed project would not result in a significant impact, nor would it result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant cumulative impact.

The long-term effects of the project are likely to improve the safety and functionality of the school. The project site is not in the vicinity of a Scenic Highway, and the project would not be expected to impact historical resources. No historic properties are known to exist in the project area; if artifacts were to be found during construction, work would stop immediately, and a qualified archeologist would be consulted with before work were to resume.

Avoidance and minimization measures would be incorporated to avoid impacts to biological resources. Such measures include limiting tree removal to outside of the nesting season (Feb 1 through Aug 31). Alternatively, if vegetation removal was needed during the nesting period, a nesting bird survey would be required. If nesting or migratory birds were found, the San Juan Unified School District would be responsible for establishing no-work buffers, as necessary, with the input of CDFW, before the commencement of construction or tree removal activities.

Considering the data summarized in this memorandum, it is Terracon’s opinion that the Cameron Ranch Elementary School 2024 Site Security and Hardcourt Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA documentation.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## PURCHASE AGREEMENT  

This Agreement is made this 8th day of October, 2024, by and between San Juan Unified School District, “District,” and Jones-Campbell Co., Inc. DBA Campbell Keller, “Vendor,” (“Agreement,” or “Contract”) with respect to the following recitals:

A. District is a public school district organized and existing under the laws of the State of California.

B. Vendor was the lowest responsible bidder for the District’s Bid Package #25-202 for the purchase and delivery of the items of equipment, materials, and supplies detailed in the Bid Package (defined below) provided by the District (“Items”).

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

1. **Notice to Proceed.** Vendor agrees that a Notice to Proceed shall trigger parties’ obligations to purchase and deliver Items as described in that particular Notice to Proceed for the specified project. The date of commencement of parties’ obligations is the date established in the Notice to Proceed. The date of commencement shall not be postponed by the failure to act of the Bidder or of persons or entities for whom Bidder is responsible. District is only responsible for payment to Vendor for furniture identified in a Notice to Proceed. District is not responsible for payment to Vendor for furniture estimates included in the Bid Form.

2. **Location for Delivery.** Vendor agrees to deliver the Items to District at various locations within the District. Delivery locations will vary based on the installation location for the ordered items and be included in the Notice to Proceed.

3. **Time for Delivery.** Vendor shall satisfactorily and timely deliver the Items in full to the District as specified in the District’s bid package documents for BP #25-202 (“Bid Package”) and as identified in the Notice to Proceed, including but not limited to the Purchase Specifications and any addenda. Time is of the essence in this Contract. If Vendor fails to satisfactorily and timely deliver the Items, the District may purchase items from other sources and recover damages from Vendor as allowed by applicable law, including but not limited to the purchase cost in excess of the contract price (see next section) and other costs incurred due to the Vendor’s failure to timely deliver.

4. **Liquidated Damages.** Failure to complete the work within the time and in the manner provided for in this Contract for each individual Notice to Proceed shall subject the Vendor to liquidated damages. The actual occurrence of damages and the actual amount of the damages which the District would suffer if the Contract were not completed within the specified times set forth are dependent upon many circumstances and conditions which could prevail in various combinations and, from the nature of the case, it is
<!-- Page 52 -->
![Attachment 1](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+1)

impracticable and extremely difficult to fix the actual damages. Damages which the District would suffer in the event of delay include, but are not limited to, loss of the use of the Contract, disruption of activities, costs of administration, supervision and the incalculable inconvenience and loss suffered by the public.

Accordingly, the Parties agree that the amount herein set forth shall be the amount of damages which the District shall directly incur upon failure of the Vendor to complete the Contract within the time specified: $100 (per classroom only), for each calendar day by which completion of the Contract is delayed beyond the Completion Deadline as specified in the Notice to Proceed.

If the District accepts any items or makes any payment under this Agreement after a default by reason of delays, the payment or payments shall in no respect constitute a waiver or modification of any Agreement provisions regarding time of completion and liquidated damages.

5. Contract Term and Not-to-Exceed Price. The term of this Contract is Three (3) year(s) from the date of award of the Contract by the District’s governing board (“Term”). For every satisfactory and timely delivery of ordered Items, District agrees to pay Vendor based on the unit prices and taxes listed by Vendor in the Bid Form for those Items, with such payment being made within forty-five (45) calendar days following receipt of Vendor’s invoice or satisfactory and timely delivery, whichever is later. The District’s total purchases from Vendor under this Contract may not exceed Forty Million Two-Hundred Twenty-Seven Thousand Nine-Hundred Forty Dollars and Six Cents ($40,227,940.06). At any time during the Term, District may terminate the Contract for convenience effective upon Vendor’s receipt of written notice of such termination; and such written notice may limit or delay the effective date of the termination. In addition, District may give written notice of termination of the Contract for cause in the event of a breach of the Contract by Vendor that Vendor failed to cure within seven (7) days after receiving a written demand for cure from District.

6. Renewal of Term. The District and Vendor may agree in writing to renew the term of this Agreement for up to two one-year extensions.

7. Termination. The District may terminate the Contract for the District’s convenience and without cause at any time between Notices to Proceed. Upon receipt of written notice from the District of such termination for the District’s convenience, the Vendor shall complete all obligations under any Notice to Proceed issued prior to the effective date of the termination. In case of such termination for the District’s convenience, the Vendor shall be entitled to receive payment for Items described in a Notice to Proceed issued prior to the effective date of the termination.

8. Conformance to Contract Documents. Vendor agrees that the Items to be furnished pursuant to this Agreement (“Contract”) shall conform to all of the requirements set forth in the Contract Documents, as defined below.

9. Indemnity. Vendor shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless District and its agents, representatives, officers, consultants, employees, governing board, and members of its

# FINGERPRINTING NOTICE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
## FOR ALL CONTRACTS EXCEPT WHEN CONSTRUCTION EXCEPTION IS MET
### (Education Code Section 45125.1)

Other than business entities performing construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or repair who have complied with Education Code section 45125.2, business entities entering into contracts with the District must comply with Education Code sections 45125.1. Such entities are responsible for ensuring full compliance with the law and should therefore review all applicable statutes and regulations. The following information is provided simply to assist such entities with compliance with the law:

1. You (as a business entity) shall ensure that each of your employees who interacts with pupils outside of the immediate supervision and control of the pupil’s parent or guardian or a school employee has a valid criminal records summary as described in Education Code section 44237. (Education Code §45125.1(a).) You shall do the same for any other employees as directed by the District. (Education Code §45125.1(c).) When you perform the criminal background check, you shall immediately provide any subsequent arrest and conviction information it receives to the District pursuant to the subsequent arrest service. (Education Code §45125.1(a).)

2. You shall not permit an employee to interact with pupils until the Department of Justice has ascertained that the employee has not been convicted of a felony as defined in Education Code section 45121. (Education Code §45125.1(e).) See the lists of violent and serious felonies in Attachment A to this Notice.

3. Prior to performing any work or services under your contract with the District, and prior to being present on District property or being within the vicinity of District pupils, you shall certify in writing to the District under the penalty of perjury that neither the employer nor any of its employees who are required to submit fingerprints, and who may interact with pupils, have been convicted of a felony as defined in Education Code section 45121. (Education Code §45125.1(f).) For this certification, you shall use the form in Attachment B to this Notice.

4. If you are providing the above services in an emergency or exceptional situation, you are not required to comply with Education Code section 45125.1, above. An “emergency or exceptional” situation is one in which public health or safety is endangered or when repairs are needed to make a facility safe and habitable. The District shall determine whether an emergency or exceptional situation exists. (Education Code §45125.1(b).)

5. If you are an individual operating as a sole proprietor of a business entity, you are considered an employee of that entity for purposes of Education Code section 45125.1, and the District shall prepare and submit your fingerprints to the Department of Justice as described in Education Code section 45125.1(a).

# College Credit Course/Dual Enrollment
Dual enrollment enables high school students to take college courses, taught by college professors, at a high school campus. These courses not only count towards a high school diploma but also allow students to get a head start on higher post-secondary education goals.

| Year       | Description                                                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **2016**   | Legislation changed dual enrollment by creating incentives for community colleges to partner with school districts. |
| **2020**   | San Juan Unified entered into a partnership with American River College (ARC) to offer a college pathway to our students. |
| **2020-2021** | San Juan and ARC offered 3 courses across seven high schools with courses taken outside of the day. |
| **2021-2024** | Students supported with teacher facilitators in all schools and the number of courses grew to 20 courses. |
| **BEYOND** | Continue our partnerships, including SUITA, ARC, and PLT to solidify practice and increase support for all. |

# College/Career Indicator (CCI): Measures of Career Readiness

The CCI shows how well local educational agencies (LEAs) and schools are preparing high school students for success after graduation, whether in postsecondary education or in a career. For this reason, the CCI consists of both college- and career-readiness measures. This flyer contains the career-readiness measures. For college-readiness measures, please access the California Department of Education (CDE) CCI Measures of College Readiness document at [https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/cm/documents/ccicollege.pdf](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/ac/cm/documents/ccicollege.pdf).

Career readiness means completing rigorous coursework and engaging in learning experiences that are designed to prepare students for the workforce. Several measures have been approved by the State Board of Education as indicating career readiness, as shown below. For each measure, specific criteria are used to determine whether a student is “Prepared” or “Approaching Prepared.”

## Prepared

Graduates classified as Prepared must meet at least one of the criteria:

## CTE Options

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS MORE THAN 30 PATHWAYS ACROSS 13 INDUSTRY SECTORS AT OUR HIGH SCHOOLS.**

Students can complete a pathway at their school or apply for a spot in one of our “open-to-all” pathways at another high school within the district – subject to availability.

## What is CTE?

Career Technical Education (CTE) is a program of study that teaches students real-world skills and knowledge for specific jobs or careers. Suppose you’re interested in becoming a chef, an emergency responder, a programmer, a nurse, or an engineer. CTE programs like culinary arts, emergency medical services, computer science, nursing, or engineering offer courses and hands-on experiences related to these careers.

CTE is all about hands-on learning, providing a sneak peek into what working in those careers might be like before you even graduate high school. Imagine cooking in a professional kitchen, learning emergency life-saving skills, writing computer programs, caring for patients, or understanding how buildings are designed and built. Our CTE programs also collaborate with businesses and colleges, allowing you to meet professionals in your field of interest, participate in work-based learning, and even earn college credits while still in high school.

CTE serves as a bridge that connects your school learning with the practical skills you need for a job, making learning more exciting and directly applicable to your future career. This connection ensures that what you learn in CTE is theoretical, practical, and relevant to your chosen career path.

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT**  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  

**AGENDA ITEM:** J.2  
**MEETING DATE:** 10/08/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Strategic Plan Update (Allen) - 7:45 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Administration  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Report: The superintendent is recommending that the board receive a report regarding rollout and implementation of the district's strategic plan.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
In the 2023-24 school year, San Juan Unified engaged in a year-long process to develop a strategic plan based on the voices and needs of its students, families, staff, and community. Through an intensive engagement process, a plan was drafted and refined identifying the values that form the foundation of our mission, the vision that we hope to make real for our students, and the strategic directions that address our most immediate and pressing needs to achieve our goal. After the drafting and revision process, the board adopted the plan in May of 2024.  

Work to implement the plan began over the summer and has continued into the start of the 2024-25 school year. The first element of implementation has been to share the plan through the use of collateral materials, inclusion of the plan as one of the district's guiding documents, and introducing the plan to staff and students in a variety of settings. The second element of implementation has been to operationalize the plan by connecting actions to its strategic directions, launching initiatives across the organization aligned to the plan and problems of practice, and prioritizing specific outcome goals under each strategic direction.  

In addition to these efforts to align and implement actions to the strategic plan, staff are currently working to identify metrics for determining success of the plan as a whole. While each individual effort has specific metrics, staff are also working to consider what indicators will help identify if we are making progress toward our vision and which indicators can help us determine if changes in our efforts or strategies are needed as conditions change.

![Key Takeaways from Student Leaders Strategic Plan Core Values](https://via.placeholder.com/768x972.png?text=Key+Takeaways+from+Student+Leaders+Strategic+Plan+Core+Values)

**VOICE AND RESILIENCE**  
Using one's voice, especially in difficult situations, builds resilience and fosters change. When students feel empowered to express their opinions and experiences, they become more resilient. This empowerment is crucial for advocating for meaningful, lasting change and fighting against inequality.

**BELONGING**  
A sense of belonging is the foundation for success, innovation, and resilience. Environments where students feel safe and included enable them to thrive. Clubs, events, and initiatives that promote inclusivity ensure all students feel represented and connected to their school community.

**RELEVANCE AND INNOVATION**  
Education must be relevant and tied to real-world skills and future opportunities to be impactful. Schools focus on curriculums and programs that align with students' needs, making education actionable and immediately beneficial for their future careers and life choices.

**SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE**  
Schools are prioritizing the development of social and emotional skills to help students navigate challenges. Programs focusing on emotional well-being, peer support, and kindness are integral, enabling students to manage stress and adversity effectively, just as they would academic challenges.

**CHAMPIONING AND ADVOCACY**  
There is a focus on championing equality and ensuring all students, especially marginalized ones, are heard. Student groups and councils are platforms to address unequal treatment and provide support, fostering a sense of collective responsibility and advocacy within the school.

**ACCESSIBILITY FOR ALL**  
Ensuring equal access to educational opportunities is a common theme across schools. Pathways for engaging in rigorous courses, vocational training, and other programs ensure inclusivity. Measurable goals and specific programs help all students develop crucial skills for their future.

**CULTURAL INCLUSIVITY**  
Celebrating cultural diversity fosters belonging and school spirit. Events like Culture Fairs and International Nights promote inclusivity, enabling students to engage with and learn about different cultures, building a connected and diverse school community.

**CREATING SAFE EXPRESSION ENVIRONMENTS**  
Fear of judgment holds students back from using their voice. Hence, fostering safe environments for expression is essential. When students feel safe to share their thoughts without fear, their resilience and capacity for advocating constructive change are significantly enhanced.

![San Juan Unified School District Board Policy Manual](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=San+Juan+Unified+School+District+Board+Policy+Manual)

**Policy 0420.41: Charter School Oversight**  
**Status: ADOPTED**  
**Original Adopted Date:** 02/25/2014 | **Last Revised Date:** 10/11/2022 | **Last Reviewed Date:** 10/11/2022  

The Governing Board recognizes its ongoing responsibility to oversee any charter school authorized by the board, and to ensure it is successfully fulfilling the terms of its charter and is providing a high-quality educational program for students enrolled in the charter school.

The superintendent or designee shall identify at least one staff member to serve as a contact person for each charter school authorized by the board. (Education Code section 47604.32)

The superintendent or designee shall visit each charter school at least annually and may inspect or observe any part of the charter school at any time. (Education Code sections 47604.32, 47607)

The superintendent or designated charter school contact shall attend meetings of the charter school governing body whenever possible and shall periodically meet with a representative of the charter school.

**Monitoring Charter School Performance**

Any charter school authorized by the Board shall be monitored by the Superintendent or designee to determine whether the charter school complies with all legal requirements applicable to charter schools, including all reports required of charter schools by law, as specified in Education Code 47604.32. Any violations of law shall be reported to the Board.

The Board shall monitor each charter school to determine whether it is achieving the measurable student outcomes set forth in the charter, both schoolwide and for each numerically significant student subgroup served by the school as defined in Education Code 52052. This determination shall be based on the measures specified in the approved charter and any applicable MOU, and on the charter school's annual review and assessment of its progress toward the goals and actions identified in its local control and accountability plan (LCAP), as reported in the California School Dashboard.

The Board shall monitor the fiscal condition of the charter school based on any financial report or information obtained from the charter school, including, but not limited to, the charter school's preliminary budget, LCAP and annual update of the charter school's LCAP, first and second interim financial reports, and final unaudited report for the full prior year. (Education Code 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5)  

143
<!-- Page 144 -->
# Waivers

If the charter school wishes to request a general waiver of any state law or regulation applicable to it, it shall request that Board approve and the district submit a general waiver request to the State Board of Education (SBE) on its behalf. Upon approval of the Board, the superintendent or designee shall submit such a waiver request to SBE on behalf of the charter school.

## Provision of District Services

Upon approval by the Board of an appropriate agreement, the charter school may purchase administrative or other services from the district or any other source. (Education Code section 47613)

Whenever the district agrees to provide administrative or support services to a charter school, the district and the charter school shall develop a memorandum of understanding (MOU) which clarifies the financial and operational agreements between them.

At the request of a charter school, the superintendent or designee shall create and submit any reports required by the State Teachers' Retirement System or Public Employees' Retirement System on behalf of the charter school. The district may charge the charter school for the actual costs of the reporting services, but shall not require the charter school to purchase payroll processing services from the district as a condition for creating and submitting the reports. (Education Code section 47611.3)

## Material Revisions to Charter

Material revisions to a charter may only be made with board approval. Material revisions shall be governed by the same standards and criteria that apply to petitions for the authorization of charter schools as set forth in Education Code section 47605 and shall include, but not be limited to, a reasonably comprehensive description of any new requirement of charter schools enacted into law after the charter was originally granted or last renewed. (Education Code section 47607)

If an approved charter school proposes to expand operations to one or more additional sites or grade levels, whether concurrently with or unrelated to a renewal, the charter school shall request a material revision to its charter and shall notify the board of those additional locations or grade levels. The board shall consider approval of the additional locations or grade levels at an open meeting. (Education Code sections 47605, 47607)

The board shall have the authority to determine whether a proposed change in charter school operations constitutes a material revision of the approved charter.

The Board may deny a proposed material revision if it finds that the proposed material revision would render the charter school demonstrably unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community in which the school is located or proposes to locate. In making this finding, the Board shall consider all of the following: (Education Code 47605)

144
<!-- Page 145 -->
![Attachment 1](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+1)

1. The fiscal impact of the proposed expansion on the district  
2. The extent to which the expansion would substantially undermine existing services, academic offerings, or programmatic offerings  
3. Whether the expansion would duplicate a program currently offered within the district that has sufficient capacity for the students proposed to be served within reasonable proximity to where the charter school intends to locate  

Additionally, the Board may deny a proposed material revision if it finds that the district is not positioned to absorb the fiscal impact of the proposed material revision. The Board shall make this finding if the district has a qualified interim certification pursuant to Education Code 42131 and the County Superintendent of Schools, in consultation with the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, certifies that approving the charter school would result in the district having a negative interim certification pursuant to Education Code 42131, the district has a negative interim certification pursuant to Education Code 42131, or the district is under state receivership. (Education Code 47605)  

**Location of Charter Schools**  

Except when permitted to operate outside district boundaries pursuant to Education Code 47605 and 47605.1, a charter school shall be located within district boundaries.  

**Monitoring Charter School Performance**  

Any charter school authorized by the board shall be monitored by the superintendent or designee to determine whether the charter school complies with all legal requirements applicable to charter schools, including all reports required of charter schools by law, as specified in Education Code section 47604.32. Any violations of law shall be reported to the board.  

The Board shall monitor each charter school to determine whether it is achieving the measurable student outcomes set forth in the charter, both schoolwide and for each numerically significant student subgroup served by the school as defined in Education Code section 52052. This determination shall be based on the measures specified in the approved charter and any applicable MOU, and on the charter school’s annual review and assessment of its progress toward the goals and actions identified in its local control and accountability plan (LCAP), as reported in the California School Dashboard.  

The board shall monitor the fiscal condition of the charter school based on any financial report or information obtained from the charter school, including, but not limited to, the charter school’s preliminary budget, LCAP and annual update of the charter school’s LCAP, first and second interim financial reports, and final unaudited report for the full prior year. (Education Code sections 47604.32, 47604.33, 47606.5)  

145
<!-- Page 146 -->
# Fees/Charges for Supervisorial Oversight

The district may charge for district supervisory oversight as follows: (Education Code 47613; 5 CCR 11969.7)

1. Actual costs up to one percent of the charter school's revenue **if the district provides the charter school with facilities under Education Code 47614 and charges the charter school a pro-rata share of the facilities cost.**

2. Actual costs up to three percent of the charter school's revenue **if the district provides the charter school substantially rent-free facilities. If the district provides the charter school with facilities under Education Code 47614 and charges the charter school a pro-rata share of the facilities costs calculated pursuant to 5 CCR 11969.7, the district may only charge the charter school for the actual costs of supervisorial oversight up to one percent of the charter school's revenue.**

3. Actual costs if the district is assigned supervisorial oversight responsibility for the charter school by SBE when authorized on appeal.

## Technical Assistance/Intervention

Whenever a charter school is identified for technical assistance based on the performance of one or more numerically significant student subgroups on SBE-established criteria, the charter school shall receive technical assistance from the County Superintendent of Schools. Such technical assistance shall be focused on building the charter school's capacity to develop and implement actions and services responsive to student and community needs, including, but not limited to, any of the following: (Education Code section 47607.3)

1. Assisting the charter school to identify its strengths and weaknesses in regard to the state priorities applicable to the charter school pursuant to Education Code section 47605. This shall include working collaboratively with the charter school to review performance data on the state and local indicators included in the California School Dashboard and other relevant local data and to identify effective, evidence-based programs or practices that address any areas of weakness.

2. Working collaboratively with the charter school to secure assistance from an academic, programmatic, or fiscal expert or team of experts to identify and implement effective programs and practices that are designed to improve performance in any areas of weakness identified by the charter school. Another service provider, including, but not limited to, a school district, county office of education, or charter school, may be solicited to act as a partner to the charter school in need of technical assistance.

3. Obtaining from the charter school timely documentation demonstrating that it has completed the activities described in Items #1 and 2 or substantially similar activities or has selected another service provider to work with the charter school to complete the activities described in Items #1 and 2 or substantially similar activities, and ongoing communication with the Board to assess the charter school's progress in improving student outcomes.

In addition, if, in three out of four consecutive school years, a charter school fails to improve outcomes for three or more numerically significant student subgroups, or for all of the student 146
<!-- Page 147 -->
![Attachment 1](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+1)

subgroups if the school has fewer than three subgroups, in regard to one or more state or school priorities identified in the charter, the County Superintendent may request that the Superintendent of Public Instruction (SPI), with SBE approval, assign the California Collaborative for Educational Excellence to provide advice and assistance to the charter school pursuant to Education Code section 52074. (Education Code sections 47607.3; 52072)

In accordance with law, the board may deny a charter school's renewal petition or may revoke a charter based on the charter school's poor performance, especially with regard to inadequate academic achievement of all numerically significant subgroups of students served by the charter school. (Education Code 47607, 47607.2)

## Complaints

Each charter school shall establish and maintain policies and procedures in accordance with the uniform complaint procedures as specified in 5 CCR 4600-4670 to enable any person alleging the school's noncompliance with Education Code sections 47606.5 or 47607.3 to file a complaint with the charter school. (Education Code section 52075)

A complaint may be filed anonymously if the complaint provides evidence or information leading to evidence to support an allegation of noncompliance. A complainant who is not satisfied with the decision may appeal the decision to the SPI. (Education Code section 52075)

If the charter school finds merit in the complaint or the SPI finds merit in an appeal, a remedy shall be provided to all affected students and parents/guardians. (Education Code section 52075)

## School Closure

In the event that the Board revokes or denies renewal of a charter or the charter school ceases operation for any reason, the superintendent or designee shall, when applicable in accordance with the charter and/or a memorandum of understanding, provide assistance to facilitate the transfer of the charter school's former students and to finalize financial reporting and close-out of the charter school.

The superintendent or designee shall provide notification to the California Department of Education, within 10 calendar days of the board's action, if renewal of a charter is denied, a charter is revoked, or a charter school will cease operation for any reason.

Such notification shall include, but not be limited to, a description of the circumstances of the closure, the effective date of the closure, and the location of student and personnel records. (Education Code sections 47604.32; 5 CCR 11962.1)

SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
BOARD OF EDUCATION  

AGENDA ITEM: J.4  
MEETING DATE: 10/08/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Intent to Convey Temporary Construction Easement at Northridge Elementary School to the Fair Oaks Water District (Camarada) - 8:10 p.m.  

**DEPARTMENT:** Operations  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt Resolution No. 4156, authorizing the intent to convey a temporary construction easement at Northridge Elementary School to the Fair Oaks Water District.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The Fair Oaks Water District (FOWD) will be drilling a new production well at Northridge Elementary School in the coming months. This well is to be constructed on a FOWD-owned parcel adjacent to the existing well site, located in the southeast corner of the school. The new well and all related facilities will replace FOWD’s existing production well, which is scheduled for retirement once construction of the new well is complete.  

The FOWD is requesting a Temporary Construction Easement for the area surrounding the well site per the map and property bounds that are attached with this item. The easement is intended to provide additional working space around the site and will also be used as a staging area for materials and equipment. This area is to be enclosed with temporary construction fencing that is screened for safety and security purposes. The temporary construction easement would be required for the duration of the project, which is anticipated to be completed on December 31, 2025. This schedule is subject to change and could be extended depending on key project milestones.

### AGENDA ITEM: J.5  
### MEETING DATE: 10/08/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Variable Term Waivers (Toto) - 8:15 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Human Resources  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the submission of Variable Term Waivers to the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) effective 08/01/2024-06/11/2025 for the individuals in the attached documents.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
California is experiencing an unprecedented teacher shortage and finding fully credentialed teachers has been a challenge. As a result, the district needs to apply for the following Variable Term Waivers.  

A Variable Term Waiver for the Crosscultural, Language & Academic Development (CLAD) is necessary to provide an authorization for the individuals in the attached documents to provide services to English learners. They are each still in progress in completing their program requirements through Yolo-Solano Center for Teacher Credentialing or San Diego County Office of Education. Syler Apis, Justin Bethune, and Christopher Tayamen are all initial waiver requests. Erica Carruth, Michael DiSalvo, and Spencer Murrish are all subsequent waiver requests.  

Individuals listed in the attached requiring a CLAD authorization either hold a Preliminary Designated Subjects - Career Technical Education Credential or are applying for this credential type through Yolo-Solano Center for Teacher Credentialing or San Diego County Office of Education. Upon completion of the clear program through one of these programs, they will be recommended for a Clear Designated Subjects Career Technical Education Credential with an embedded English learner authorization. The CLAD waiver will allow them to provide services to English learners while they are working on their clear credential requirements.  

In addition to the CCSD/CLAD waivers cited above, three Variable Term Waivers are necessary to provide subject instruction and various services credentials.  

- Diana Coughran is working to become eligible for a Preliminary Single Subject in World Languages: Spanish credential. Diana is working to take the California Subject Examinations for Teachers to meet subject-matter competency.  
- Azadeh Khazaei is currently enrolled in a Master of Arts in Education with an emphasis in School Counseling in Pupil Personnel Services credential program through Alliant International University and is working towards a Clear Pupil Personnel Services credential specializing in School Counseling.  
- April Maple is currently enrolled in a Pupil Personnel Services Credential in School Social Work program through California State University, Sacramento, and is working towards a Clear Pupil Personnel Services Credential in School Social Work.  

Aspects of the waiver application are intentionally left blank (personal information) and will be completed upon submission to the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC).  

All requests for Variable Term Waivers must be presented for approval to the governing board of the public school district. Every waiver request submitted to the CTC must include verification that a notice of intent to employ the named applicant in the identified position has been made public.

12. CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT MANDATED REPORTING (to be answered by the applicant)  
As a document holder authorized to work with children, it is part of my professional and ethical duty to report every instance of child abuse or neglect known or suspected to have occurred to a child with whom I have professional contact.

I understand that I must report immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, by telephone to a law enforcement agency or a child protective agency, and will send a written report and any evidence relating to the incident within 36 hours of becoming aware of the abuse or neglect of the child.

I understand that reporting the information regarding a case of possible child abuse or neglect to an employer, supervisor, school principal, school counselor, coworker, or other person is not a substitute for making a mandated report to a law enforcement agency or a child protective agency.

I understand that the reporting duties are individual and no supervisor or administrator may impede or inhibit my reporting duties.

I understand that once I submit a report, I am not required to disclose my identity to my employer.

I understand that my failure to report an instance of suspected child abuse or neglect as required by the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act under Section 11166 of the Penal Code is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail or by a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine.

I acknowledge and certify that as a document holder, I will fulfill all the duties required of a mandated reporter.

[ ] I agree

12. CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT MANDATED REPORTING (to be answered by the applicant)  
As a document holder authorized to work with children, it is part of my professional and ethical duty to report every instance of child abuse or neglect known or suspected to have occurred to a child with whom I have professional contact.

I understand that I must report immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, by telephone to a law enforcement agency or a child protective agency, and will send a written report and any evidence relating to the incident within 36 hours of becoming aware of the abuse or neglect of the child.

I understand that reporting the information regarding a case of possible child abuse or neglect to an employer, supervisor, school principal, school counselor, coworker, or other person is not a substitute for making a mandated report to a law enforcement agency or a child protective agency.

I understand that the reporting duties are individual and no supervisor or administrator may impede or inhibit my reporting duties.

I understand that once I submit a report, I am not required to disclose my identity to my employer.

I understand that my failure to report an instance of suspected child abuse or neglect as required by the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act under Section 11166 of the Penal Code is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail or by a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine.

**12. CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT MANDATED REPORTING (to be answered by the applicant)**  
As a document holder authorized to work with children, it is part of my professional and ethical duty to report every instance of child abuse or neglect known or suspected to have occurred to a child with whom I have professional contact.

I understand that I must report immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, by telephone to a law enforcement agency or a child protective agency, and will send a written report and any evidence relating to the incident within 36 hours of becoming aware of the abuse or neglect of the child.

I understand that reporting the information regarding a case of possible child abuse or neglect to an employer, supervisor, school principal, school counselor, coworker, or other person is not a substitute for making a mandated report to a law enforcement agency or a child protective agency.

I understand that the reporting duties are individual and no supervisor or administrator may impede or inhibit my reporting duties.

I understand that once I submit a report, I am not required to disclose my identity to my employer.

I understand that my failure to report an instance of suspected child abuse or neglect as required by the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act under Section 11166 of the Penal Code is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail or by a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine.

I acknowledge and certify that as a document holder, I will fulfill all the duties required of a mandated reporter.

![Child Abuse and Neglect Mandated Reporting](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=12.+CHILD+ABUSE+AND+NEGLECT+MANDATED+REPORTING+to+be+answered+by+the+applicant)

12. CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT MANDATED REPORTING (to be answered by the applicant)  
As a document holder authorized to work with children, it is part of my professional and ethical duty to report every instance of child abuse or neglect known or suspected to have occurred to a child with whom I have professional contact.

I understand that I must report immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, by telephone to a law enforcement agency or a child protective agency, and will send a written report and any evidence relating to the incident within 36 hours of becoming aware of the abuse or neglect of the child.

I understand that reporting the information regarding a case of possible child abuse or neglect to an employer, supervisor, school principal, school counselor, coworker, or other person is not a substitute for making a mandated report to a law enforcement agency or a child protective agency.

I understand that the reporting duties are individual and no supervisor or administrator may impede or inhibit my reporting duties.

I understand that once I submit a report, I am not required to disclose my identity to my employer.

I understand that my failure to report an instance of suspected child abuse or neglect as required by the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act under Section 11166 of the Penal Code is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail or by a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine.

I acknowledge and certify that as a document holder, I will fulfill all the duties required of a mandated reporter.

12. CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT MANDATED REPORTING (to be answered by the applicant)  
As a document holder authorized to work with children, it is part of my professional and ethical duty to report every instance of child abuse or neglect known or suspected to have occurred to a child with whom I have professional contact.

I understand that I must report immediately, or as soon as practicably possible, by telephone to a law enforcement agency or a child protective agency, and will send a written report and any evidence relating to the incident within 36 hours of becoming aware of the abuse or neglect of the child.

I understand that reporting the information regarding a case of possible child abuse or neglect to an employer, supervisor, school principal, school counselor, coworker, or other person is not a substitute for making a mandated report to a law enforcement agency or a child protective agency.

I understand that the reporting duties are individual and no supervisor or administrator may impede or inhibit my reporting duties.

I understand that once I submit a report, I am not required to disclose my identity to my employer.

I understand that my failure to report an instance of suspected child abuse or neglect as required by the Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act under Section 11166 of the Penal Code is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail or by a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that imprisonment and fine.

I acknowledge and certify that as a document holder, I will fulfill all the duties required of a mandated reporter.

WHEREAS, many situations arise in which assignment to teach such subject is both necessary and desirable for the efficient operation of the school;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that for the 2024-2025 school year, the Superintendent of the San Juan Unified School District, shall be authorized to assign teachers in accordance with the procedures enumerated below.

**Action:** The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the submission of four Provisional Internship Permits to the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing (CTC) effective 08/11/2024-06/11/2025 for Liberty Gawthorne, Vadym Golub, Logan Reis, and Amber Yamanaka.  

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:  
California is experiencing an unprecedented teacher shortage and finding fully credentialed teachers has been a challenge. As a result, the district needs to apply for the following Provisional Internship Permits.  

- A Provisional Internship Permit is necessary to provide an authorization for Liberty Gawthorne to teach an assignment which requires an authorization for Multiple Subject for the 2024-2025 school year at Starr King K-8 School. Ms. Gawthorne is pursuing enrollment in an intern program to become intern eligible.  

- A Provisional Internship Permit is necessary to provide an authorization for Vadym Golub to teach an assignment which requires an authorization for Education Specialist Instruction in Extensive Support Needs for the 2024-2025 school year at Ralph Richardson Center. Mr. Golub is pursuing enrollment in an intern program to become intern eligible.  

- A Provisional Internship Permit is necessary to provide an authorization for Logan Reis to teach a Single Subject in English assignment which requires an authorization for the 2024-2025 school year at Mesa Verde High School. Mr. Reis is pursuing enrollment in an intern program to become intern eligible.  

- A Provisional Internship Permit is necessary to provide an authorization for Amber Yamanaka to teach an assignment which requires an authorization for Education Specialist Instruction in Extensive Support Needs for the 2024-2025 school year at Del Campo High School. Ms. Yamanaka is pursuing enrollment in an intern program to become intern eligible.  

Aspects of the CL-857 are intentionally left blank (applicant’s personal information and board approval) and will be completed upon submission to the CTC.  

All requests for Provisional Internship Permits must be presented for approval to the governing board of the public school district. Every Provisional Internship Permit request submitted to the CTC must include verification that a notice of intent to employ the named applicant in the identified position has been made public.

**AGENDA ITEM:** J.8  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**MEETING DATE:** 10/08/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Exemption to the Separation-From-Service Requirement (Toto) - 8:30 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Human Resources  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt Resolution No. 4155 approving the exemption to the separation-from-service requirement pursuant to Education Code section 24214.5 or 26812.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
In response to concerns about the difficulty employers are having in hiring teachers, specifically substitute teachers, during the current teacher shortage, the existing law provides for an exemption to the separation-from-service requirement imposed immediately after retirement if the retired CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program member or Cash Balance Benefit Program participant receiving an annuity is hired in a critically needed position and meets other eligibility criteria. To meet one of the requirements of the exemption qualification, the governing board of the employee must approve the retired CalSTRS member or participant appointment by adopting a resolution in a public meeting. Thus, by adopting the resolution, the governing board will be providing retired certificated employees the ability to work as a substitute teacher without waiting the required 180 calendar days.

**RESOLUTION FOR EXEMPTION TO THE SEPARATION-FROM-SERVICE REQUIREMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 24214.5 OR 26812 OF THE EDUCATION CODE**  
**Resolution No. 4155**

WHEREAS, pursuant to Education Codes sections 24214.5 and 26812, there is a 180 calendar day separation-from-service requirement for all retired CalSTRS members and participants; and,

WHEREAS, all retired CalSTRS members and participants are subject to a restriction if they perform retired member activities as defined by section 22164.5 of the Education Code or retired participant activities as defined by section 26135.7 of the Education Code, during the first 180 calendar days after their most recent retirement; and,

WHEREAS, if the retired CalSTRS member or participant performed retired member or participant activities during this period, CalSTRS will reduce his or her retirement benefit or annuity one dollar for each dollar earned for performing retired member or participant activities during the 180-day period; and,

WHEREAS, there is an exemption from the 180 calendar day separation-from-service requirement for a member or participant who retires for service and is at or above normal retirement age; and,

WHEREAS, in order to qualify for this narrow exemption, the employer must appoint the retired member or participant to a critically needed position that has been approved by the governing body of the employer in a public meeting as reflected in a resolution; and,

WHEREAS, this approval by the governing body of the employer in a public meeting as reflected in a resolution must be finalized and communicated to CalSTRS before the member or participant commences to perform retired member or participant activities; and,

WHEREAS, the Superintendent must complete the Request for Separation-from-Service Requirement Exemption form, which must be submitted to CalSTRS and received by CalSTRS before the member or participant commences to perform retired member or participant activities;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that this Board does provide public notice that the district is in critical need of substitute teachers to teach because there is a lack of qualified substitute teachers;

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board wishes to meet this critical need by hiring Andrew Avila and Gregory Grigsby, members or participants who retired for service less than 180 days ago or who will retire;

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this appointment is needed to fill this critical need before the 180 calendar day separation-from-service requirement is fulfilled;

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this member or participant did not receive a retirement incentive or any financial inducement to retire from any public employer;  

272
<!-- Page 273 -->
AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the retired member’s or participant’s termination of employment is not the basis for the need to acquire his or her services;

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the earnings for retired member activities during the 180 calendar days will still be subject to the annual postretirement earnings limit for the Defined Benefit Program;

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this member or participant will not commence to perform retired member or participant activities before this approval is authorized by the governing body of the employer in a public meeting as reflected in a resolution and received by CalSTRS;

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this member or participant will not commence to perform retired member or participant activities before the Superintendent completes the Request for Separation-from-Service Requirement Exemption form and this is transmitted to and received by CalSTRS.

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Report: regarding an update on Williams-type complaints filed with the district during the time period from July 1, 2024, to September 30, 2024.
