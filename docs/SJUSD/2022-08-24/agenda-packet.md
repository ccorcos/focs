Ms. Costa then read the following statement in announcing the action: “Although the district agreed to move to trustee area elections, the lawsuit was filed and required the district to hire counsel to defend the two cases. The district was successful in having the superior court dismiss the California Voting Rights Act claim brought by various plaintiffs. A federal claim remained in the lawsuit that we believe would also have been eventually dismissed by the court. After a voluntary settlement conference before a judge the parties reached a tentative settlement, subject to board approval, of the remaining two cases. The settlement terms require the plaintiffs to dismiss the lawsuits and the district pay attorney fees in the total amount of $130,000, that includes the statutory fees of $32,582.48 already authorized. The agreement to pay fees beyond the statutory fee amount was to assure that the district would not spend even more funds in defending the remaining two cases through trial and to put an end to these two cases.”

![Exhibit E INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Exhibit+E+INSURANCE+REQUIREMENTS)

1.1 INTRODUCTION  
The San Juan Unified School District, hereinafter called the “District” has elected, at its sole discretion, to implement an Owner Controlled Insurance Program (“OCIP”) under the Statewide Educational Wrap Up Program (“SEWUP”). The SEWUP Joint Powers Authority (“JPA”) will be providing the OCIP on behalf of the District. All terms and conditions of the SEWUP Contractual Provisions will apply during the term of the contract.

The OCIP will be primary to other valid and collectable insurance for the District and enrolled parties in the program. The SEWUP JPA will provide Workers’ Compensation, Employer’s Liability, General & Excess Liability, and Contractor’s Pollution Liability for Entity (and its Enrolled Subcontractors of every tier) and other designated parties for work performed at the Project Site (hereinafter called “Project”) as well as builder’s risk insurance. The District agrees to pay all premiums associated with the OCIP, unless otherwise stated in this section and in other contract documents.

Insurance coverage provided under the OCIP is limited in scope and specific to Work performed after the inception date of enrollment into the OCIP. Labor and ongoing operations related to offsite locations are not covered by the OCIP. In addition to any insurance provided by the District, the Entity (as defined below) and all Subcontractors will be responsible for providing certain insurance as specified in section 1.7. The District recommends that the Entity and all Subcontractors discuss the OCIP with their insurance agents, brokers or consultants to assure that proper coverages are maintained.

Keenan & Associates, hereinafter called “Program Administrator”, shall administer the OCIP on behalf of the SEWUP JPA. At all times, Entity and all Subcontractors, shall (a) cooperate with District, Program Administrator, and all OCIP insurers, as applicable, and their respective consultants, agents and representatives, in its or their administration of the OCIP and all other terms and conditions described herein and (b) comply with the terms, conditions, warranties, and subjectivities of the insurance policies provided pursuant to the OCIP, including, without limitation, any and all directives and requirements of District’s and the OCIP insurers’ respective consultants, agents and representatives, including, without limitation, any directive or requirement relating to loss control, and quality control, and the closure to District’s satisfaction of open items on any and all quality control checklists and inventories.

A. Participation in the OCIP  
Participation in the OCIP is mandatory but not automatic. Entity and each Eligible Subcontractor must follow the guidelines, as specified in section 1.5.  
Definitions:  
- **Enrollment:** Entity and each Eligible Subcontractor is considered Enrolled once required documents are received, reviewed and processed by the OCIP Program Administrator to the insurer. (See Sections 1.7 and 1.8)  
- **Entity:** The Lease-Leaseback Entity that the District engaged pursuant to the Site Lease and the Facilities Lease to perform services relating to the Project.  
- **Subcontractor:** Includes all vendors, suppliers, contractors, businesses, and other persons or entities that have been engaged by Entity to perform, or assist with the performance of, services relating to the Project.  
- **Start Date:** The date that a Subcontractor begins on-site Project-related activities, which may include Project meetings required to be held on the Project site.
<!-- Page 40 -->
![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+B)

Eligible: Includes Entity and all Subcontractors providing direct labor on the Project, and excludes Ineligible Contractors, as defined below. Temporary labor services and leasing companies are to be treated as Eligible Contractors.

Ineligible: It is not the intent to insure or enroll every entity on the Project. “Ineligible” entities include, but are not limited to:
- consultants and other professionals, such as surveyors, design professionals, inspectors, testing professionals, and others;
- material suppliers and/or vendors that do not install materials or otherwise provide labor on the project site;
- contractors not performing work on the Project Site;
- contractors for abatement and/or removal of hazardous materials;
- service providers, such as security guards and non-construction janitorial service providers, and contractors performing landscape maintenance (although landscape work itself is covered);
- truckers, including trucking to the Project where delivery is the only scope of work performed; and
- other entities that do not install materials or perform work constructing the Project.

Ineligible entities are required to ensure that any eligible subcontractors who provide on-site labor comply with the OCIP Enrollment. Any questions regarding an entity’s status as “Eligible” or “Ineligible” should be referred by written request to District and approved by the Program Administrator.

ENTITY AND EACH SUBCONTRACTOR MUST INCLUDE THIS DOCUMENT WITH THEIR BID SPECIFICATIONS TO ANY AND ALL SUBCONTRACTORS. Any contractor/subcontractor’s failure to comply with the OCIP Administrator and all OCIP requirements shall be considered non-compliant under the contract.

Enrollment of Entity’s eligible Subcontractors, at every level, is mandatory. Entity shall notify District and the Program Administrator in writing of the identity of each Subcontractor regardless of enrollment eligibility and shall cause each Subcontractor to notify the Program Administrator in writing of the identity of each of its Sub-subcontractors, prior to such parties’ commencement of their portion of the Work and prior to their entry onto the Project site. Entity and Subcontractors of all tiers shall not be deemed enrolled until the Program Administrator and OCIP insurers receive and approve a completed Contract Enrollment, for each entity. Enrollment is required prior to commencement of on-site activities, including without limitation attending Project-related meetings, but no Subcontractor shall be enrolled sooner than 30 days prior to the date they begin on-site Project activities (Start Date). Entity and each Subcontractor shall be solely responsible for any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, and suits arising out of such entity’s failure to enroll, or delay in enrolling, any of its Subcontractors.

As discussed further below, the District will require copies of insurance policies for Entity and any Subcontractors to the extent that the operations are not covered by the OCIP. If at any time the District requests copies of an insurance policy or policies, Entity agrees to provide certified copies within 30 days of the District’s request. The failure of the District to request Subcontractor policies shall not relieve Entity of the obligation to verify that its Subcontractors have all required insurance.

Unless otherwise directed by the District, Entity and Subcontractors will be required to maintain their own insurance for both on-site activities not covered by the OCIP and off-site activities and will be required to participate in the Project Safety Program (See Section 1.16). Minimum Insurance and endorsement requirements are located in Section 1.7 & 1.8 below.

   b. An employee who has been removed from the jobsite ambulatory must provide a proper medical release prior to returning to work.  
   c. Entity and each Enrolled Subcontractor will cooperate with the OCIP Carrier to facilitate the return to work of any injured employee capable of safely performing transitional duties.  
   d. When the employee is released to transitional duties, it is the Enrolled Entity’s/Subcontractor’s responsibility to facilitate the injured employee's return to work.

c. The Enrolled Entity/Subcontractor is expected to accommodate the injured employee and facilitate the return to work.

f. It will be the responsibility of the Insurance Carrier’s Adjuster to maintain communication with the treating physician and the Enrolled Entity/Subcontractor to facilitate the prompt return of an employee to full work status.

I. Conflicting Safety Requirements  
The District and SEWUP OCIP program place a very high value on project safety. Each may have their own safety requirements that are very similar in nature. However, in the event the requirements are in conflict or one is silent on a particular matter, then the requirement affording the greatest of amount protection will control. For example, if the District’s Safety Program Requirements do not mandate 6’ Fall Protection, then Section “6 Mandatory 6’ Fall Protection” contained in the SEWUP Project Insurance Manual will control.

J. Noncompliance and Unsafe Practices  
District or their representative shall have the authority to immediately cease any and all operation(s) on the jobsite that is deemed by District or their representative to be unsafe to property or has the potential to cause Bodily Injury, pursuant to Title VIII California Code of Regulation, Section 1511. Any such cessation of work shall not constitute recoverable delay or other contractual remedies for liquidated damages and may expose the offending contractor to any such losses to the District or other trades.

K. Professional Conduct Clause  
Entity and subcontractors shall at all times adhere to safety requirements (contractual and regulatory) and shall not allow on the job site any unfit person, unsafe person, anyone unskilled and unqualified to perform the work assigned to them, or anyone exhibiting such qualities. Any person in the employ of the contractor or subcontractor whom the District or the District’s agent/representative may deem incompetent, unsafe, or unfit shall be immediately dismissed from the OCIP job site and shall not again be allowed on the OCIP job site except with the written consent of District or the District’s agent/representative. The District reserves the right to request that the contractor or subcontractor’s assigned Project Supervisor/Manager be replaced immediately.

1.17 DISTRICT’S INSURANCE OBLIGATIONS; ENTITY’S/SUBCONTRACTORS’ OBLIGATIONS; REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS  
(a) District assumes no obligation to provide insurance other than that summarily described in these Contractual Provisions, in the Project Insurance Manual, and in the OCIP insurance policies. Entity/Subcontractor shall review the OCIP coverages, limits of liability, and insurance policies to satisfy themselves that the coverages offered thereby meet its needs. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to place any responsibility on District, and District disclaims any responsibility, for ensuring that the insurance provided by the OCIP is sufficient for the conduct of Entity’s/Subcontractor’s business or performance of the Work, including, without limitation, the adequacy of the limits of liability provided by, and as to all other terms, conditions and exclusions of, the OCIP insurance policies. The furnishing of insurance by District through the OCIP shall in no way relieve or limit or be construed to relieve or limit Entity/Subcontractor of any responsibility, liability or obligation imposed by the Facilities and Site Lease, the Contract Documents, the Project Insurance Manual, the OCIP insurance policies, or by law, including, without limitation, all indemnification obligations on the part of Entity/Subcontractor.
<!-- Page 56 -->
![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+B) 

(b) By enrolling in the OCIP, Entity/Subcontractor acknowledges that (i) the limits of liability of the OCIP insurance policies are shared by all insured parties under the OCIP; (ii) District is not an insurer or in the business of insurance and is not an agent, broker, partner, or guarantor of Entity/Subcontractor or any of the insurance companies providing coverage under the OCIP (the “OCIP insurers”); and (iii) District is not responsible for (a) the availability, adequacy, or exhaustion of the limits of the OCIP; (b) the present or future solvency of any of the OCIP insurers or (c) any claims or disputes by, between, or among District, Entity, Subcontractor(s), and/or any of the OCIP insurers, including, without limitation, claims or disputes arising out of any of the OCIP insurers’ payment or nonpayment of claims or losses, or such insurers’ contractual or extra-contractual duties, including, without limitation, defense and/or indemnity obligations. Any type of insurance coverage or limits of liability not provided by the OCIP which Entity/Subcontractor believes is prudent and desires for its own protection, or which is required by applicable laws or regulations, shall be its sole responsibility and expense and shall not be included in the Total Base Rent. If Contractor/Subcontractor believes that additional limits of liability beyond those provided by the OCIP would be prudent for its protection, the OCIP does not in any way prevent Contractor/Subcontractor from procuring such additional limits of liability for itself at its sole cost.

(c) Submitting documentation to enroll in the OCIP indicates the representation and agreement that Entity/Subcontractor has had the opportunity to read and analyze (and to obtain professional assistance to read and analyze) a copy of the OCIP insurance policies and understands the contents thereof. Any reference in the Facilities Lease, the Project Insurance Manual, or elsewhere in any contract document as to amount, nature, type, or extent of coverage provided under the OCIP and/or potential applicability to any potential claim or loss is for reference only and Entity/Subcontractor shall not rely upon such reference or any other oral or written statement by or on behalf of District, the Project Administrator, or any of its or their agents, employees, or representatives, but solely upon its own review and analysis of the OCIP insurance policies in formulating any understanding and/or belief as to amount, type or extent of any coverage, conditions, extensions, or limits of liability provided by and as to all other terms of the OCIP insurance policies and/or their potential applicability to any claim or loss or their sufficiency for the conduct of Entity’s/Subcontractor’s business or performance under the Facility Lease. To the extent that Entity/Subcontractor deems it prudent to secure and maintain additional, supplemental, excess, or wholly independent insurance associated with its Work on the Project or otherwise, such insurance shall be at its sole expense.

(d) Entity/Subcontractor hereby releases District, the Program Administrator, and their respective representatives, agents, directors, officers, employees, partners, shareholders, members, affiliates of every tier, successors, and assigns from any and all claims and liabilities arising out of or relating to acts, errors, omissions or negligence (i) in the design, selection, placement, adequacy, amount, limits, scope and nature of insurance coverage afforded by the OCIP, (ii) in the selection, performance and present and future solvency of the OCIP insurers, and (iii) in the implementation and administration of the OCIP. Entity/Subcontractor shall make its own determinations regarding such matters and expressly waives all rights and benefits conferred upon it by the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides:

A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.

By executing the Facilities and Site Lease or Subcontract, as applicable, to which this Exhibit is appended and by submitting documentation to enroll in the OCIP, Entity/Subcontractor expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver of the provisions of Section 1542 was separately bargained for, and expressly agrees that the release provision shall be given full force and effect, including, without limitation, as to unknown or

1.18 JOINT DEFENSE OF CLAIMS AND SUITS AGAINST MORE THAN ONE INSURED

(a) If a claim, demand, suit, or other proceeding (“Claim”) is brought against more than one insured under the OCIP, District and Entity/Subcontractor recognize the common interest of all OCIP insureds in jointly defending that Claim. To the fullest extent permitted by law, and absent a material, current, actual, and unwaivable conflict of interest mandating the appointment of separate counsel under applicable law, District and Entity/Subcontractor insured under the OCIP (i) shall be defended by the same counsel and by the same consultants and experts selected by District and/or the OCIP insurers at their sole discretion, regardless of whether the defense under the OCIP is provided subject to a reservation of rights issued by any OCIP insurer, and (ii) waive their respective rights to independent counsel as to any and all such Claims. This waiver is deemed to be continuing. Entity/Subcontractor agrees to execute such other documents as are required to effectuate this waiver and fulfill the purpose of this Section 1.18.

(b) In defense of Claims arising under the OCIP, information shared with counsel engaged to defend the insureds (“Defense Counsel”) will be protected from disclosure and shall remain privileged even after the termination of the OCIP and/or the completion of the Project and/or the termination of the Facilities and Site Lease. Entity/Subcontractor agrees not to disclose to any person or entity, other than to District and to Defense Counsel, any confidential information obtained in the defense or pursuit of Claims covered, or potentially covered, under the OCIP. Any such confidential information shall only be used in matters that arise directly pursuant to such OCIP Claims. However, disclosures of such confidential information may be made (i) upon written approval from Defense Counsel or (ii) where required or permitted by applicable law.

(c) Nothing in this Section 1.18 shall preclude Entity/Subcontractors from engaging counsel of its choice, at its sole expense, to associate in the defense of any such Claim.

1.19 Duty of Care

Nothing contained in the OCIP insurance policies, the Facilities and Site Lease (including this Exhibit), any other Contract Document, or the Project Insurance Manual shall relieve Entity/Subcontractor of its obligations to exercise due care in the performance of its duties in connection with the Work and to complete the Work in strict compliance with the Contract Documents.

NOTE: THE DISTRICT AND PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR MUST APPROVE CHANGES TO ANY OCIP REQUIREMENT OR PROCEDURE. NEITHER ENTITY NOR ANY SUBCONTRACTOR HAS THE AUTHORITY TO AMEND THE OCIP REQUIREMENTS.

![Exhibit E INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Exhibit+E+INSURANCE+REQUIREMENTS)

1.1 INTRODUCTION  
The San Juan Unified School District, hereinafter called the “District” has elected, at its sole discretion, to implement an Owner Controlled Insurance Program (“OCIP”) under the Statewide Educational Wrap Up Program (“SEWUP”). The SEWUP Joint Powers Authority (“JPA”) will be providing the OCIP on behalf of the District. All terms and conditions of the SEWUP Contractual Provisions will apply during the term of the contract.

The OCIP will be primary to other valid and collectable insurance for the District and enrolled parties in the program. The SEWUP JPA will provide Workers’ Compensation, Employer’s Liability, General & Excess Liability, and Contractor’s Pollution Liability for Entity (and its Enrolled Subcontractors of every tier) and other designated parties for work performed at the Project Site (hereinafter called “Project”) as well as builder’s risk insurance. The District agrees to pay all premiums associated with the OCIP, unless otherwise stated in this section and in other contract documents.

Insurance coverage provided under the OCIP is limited in scope and specific to Work performed after the inception date of enrollment into the OCIP. Labor and ongoing operations related to offsite locations are not covered by the OCIP. In addition to any insurance provided by the District, the Entity (as defined below) and all Subcontractors will be responsible for providing certain insurance as specified in section 1.7. The District recommends that the Entity and all Subcontractors discuss the OCIP with their insurance agents, brokers or consultants to assure that proper coverages are maintained.

Keenan & Associates, hereinafter called “Program Administrator”, shall administer the OCIP on behalf of the SEWUP JPA. At all times, Entity and all Subcontractors, shall (a) cooperate with District, Program Administrator, and all OCIP insurers, as applicable, and their respective consultants, agents and representatives, in its or their administration of the OCIP and all other terms and conditions described herein and (b) comply with the terms, conditions, warranties, and subjectivities of the insurance policies provided pursuant to the OCIP, including, without limitation, any and all directives and requirements of District’s and the OCIP insurers’ respective consultants, agents and representatives, including, without limitation, any directive or requirement relating to loss control, and quality control, and the closure to District’s satisfaction of open items on any and all quality control checklists and inventories.

A. Participation in the OCIP  
Participation in the OCIP is mandatory but not automatic. Entity and each Eligible Subcontractor must follow the guidelines, as specified in section 1.5.  
Definitions:  
- **Enrollment:** Entity and each Eligible Subcontractor is considered Enrolled once required documents are received, reviewed and processed by the OCIP Program Administrator to the insurer. (See Sections 1.7 and 1.8)  
- **Entity:** The Lease-Leaseback Entity that the District engaged pursuant to the Site Lease and the Facilities Lease to perform services relating to the Project.  
- **Subcontractor:** Includes all vendors, suppliers, contractors, businesses, and other persons or entities that have been engaged by Entity to perform, or assist with the performance of, services relating to the Project.  
- **Start Date:** The date that a Subcontractor begins on-site Project-related activities, which may include Project meetings required to be held on the Project site.
<!-- Page 61 -->
![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+B)

Eligible: Includes Entity and all Subcontractors providing direct labor on the Project, and excludes Ineligible Contractors, as defined below. Temporary labor services and leasing companies are to be treated as Eligible Contractors.

Ineligible: It is not the intent to insure or enroll every entity on the Project. “Ineligible” entities include, but are not limited to:
- consultants and other professionals, such as surveyors, design professionals, inspectors, testing professionals, and others;
- material suppliers and/or vendors that do not install materials or otherwise provide labor on the project site;
- contractors not performing work on the Project Site;
- contractors for abatement and/or removal of hazardous materials;
- service providers, such as security guards and non-construction janitorial service providers, and contractors performing landscape maintenance (although landscape work itself is covered);
- truckers, including trucking to the Project where delivery is the only scope of work performed; and
- other entities that do not install materials or perform work constructing the Project.

Ineligible entities are required to ensure that any eligible subcontractors who provide on-site labor comply with the OCIP Enrollment. Any questions regarding an entity’s status as “Eligible” or “Ineligible” should be referred by written request to District and approved by the Program Administrator.

ENTITY AND EACH SUBCONTRACTOR MUST INCLUDE THIS DOCUMENT WITH THEIR BID SPECIFICATIONS TO ANY AND ALL SUBCONTRACTORS. Any contractor/subcontractor’s failure to comply with the OCIP Administrator and all OCIP requirements shall be considered non-compliant under the contract.

Enrollment of Entity’s eligible Subcontractors, at every level, is mandatory. Entity shall notify District and the Program Administrator in writing of the identity of each Subcontractor regardless of enrollment eligibility and shall cause each Subcontractor to notify the Program Administrator in writing of the identity of each of its Sub-subcontractors, prior to such parties’ commencement of their portion of the Work and prior to their entry onto the Project site. Entity and Subcontractors of all tiers shall not be deemed enrolled until the Program Administrator and OCIP insurers receive and approve a completed Contract Enrollment, for each entity. Enrollment is required prior to commencement of on-site activities, including without limitation attending Project-related meetings, but no Subcontractor shall be enrolled sooner than 30 days prior to the date they begin on-site Project activities (Start Date). Entity and each Subcontractor shall be solely responsible for any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, and suits arising out of such entity’s failure to enroll, or delay in enrolling, any of its Subcontractors.

As discussed further below, the District will require copies of insurance policies for Entity and any Subcontractors to the extent that the operations are not covered by the OCIP. If at any time the District requests copies of an insurance policy or policies, Entity agrees to provide certified copies within 30 days of the District’s request. The failure of the District to request Subcontractor policies shall not relieve Entity of the obligation to verify that its Subcontractors have all required insurance.

Unless otherwise directed by the District, Entity and Subcontractors will be required to maintain their own insurance for both on-site activities not covered by the OCIP and off-site activities and will be required to participate in the Project Safety Program (See Section 1.16). Minimum Insurance and endorsement requirements are located in Section 1.7 & 1.8 below.
<!-- Page 62 -->

Each ineligible contractor must register with the OCIP online portal called Keenan Wrap. All required certificates and endorsements must be supplied via Keenan Wrap.

## B. Project Site and Offsite Premises
Coverages provided by the OCIP are Project Site specific. The Project Site shall be designated by the District. The Project Site consists of any and all projects that are endorsed to this policy, which includes the:

1. Ways and means adjoining the endorsed project site.
2. Adjacent locations to the endorsed projects sites where incidental operations are being performed, excluding permanent locations.

With the exception of 1 and 2 mentioned above, off-site (a) locations, (b) labor, and (c) ongoing operations are not covered by the OCIP. It will be the responsibility of Entity and each Subcontractor to maintain off-site insurance, as identified in Section 1.7, which specifies coverage types and minimum limits. Entity/Subcontractor will promptly furnish to the District, or its designated representative, Certificates of Insurance evidencing that all required insurance is in force.

## 1.2 QUALIFICATION & COST IDENTIFICATION

### A. Contractor Qualification
Pursuant to Government Code Section 4420.5, Bidders must meet certain minimum standards to bid on the Districts’ Project. The following qualification standards apply at the time of bid opening:

1. Entity shall have an average Workers’ Compensation Experience Modification Rate (EMR) of 1.25 or less over the last five (5) years OR the current published year.
   - The District strongly encourages Entity to require subcontractors to also meet this requirement, but eligible subcontractors that do not meet this standard will not be prevented from enrolling in the OCIP.
   
2. Entity shall have Zero (0) Serious and Willful violations (Labor Code Sections 6300 et seq.) against it in the past five (5) years.

3. Entity shall have provided evidence of its Injury and Illness Prevention Program (IIPP) prior to award of the Facilities Lease.

### B. Insurance Cost Exclusion
Contractor shall exclude all costs for insurance coverages provided under the OCIP. Subcontractors must certify that their bids exclude any costs relating to any insurance coverages afforded under the OCIP. The District will reject any proposed Subcontractor who has not so certified in its bid.

### C. Change Order Pricing
No change order will include any costs or markup relating to any insurance coverage afforded under the OCIP.

## 1.3 DISTRICT-PROVIDED INSURANCE COVERAGES
ENTITY/SUBCONTRACTOR SHOULD REFER TO THE ACTUAL POLICIES FOR DETAILS CONCERNING COVERAGE, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS. In the event of any claim or question regarding coverage provided by the OCIP, the original policies will prevail. OCIP policies and Project Insurance manual are available upon written request to the Program Administrator.

The OCIP is intended to provide broad coverages and high limits to Enrolled Entity/Subcontractors. The District does not warrant or represent that the OCIP coverages constitute an insurance program that completely addresses the risks of the Entity/Subcontractor.

c. The Enrolled Entity/Subcontractor is expected to accommodate the injured employee and facilitate the return to work.

f. It will be the responsibility of the Insurance Carrier’s Adjuster to maintain communication with the treating physician and the Enrolled Entity/Subcontractor to facilitate the prompt return of an employee to full work status.

I. Conflicting Safety Requirements  
The District and SEWUP OCIP program place a very high value on project safety. Each may have their own safety requirements that are very similar in nature. However, in the event the requirements are in conflict or one is silent on a particular matter, then the requirement affording the greatest of amount protection will control. For example, if the District’s Safety Program Requirements do not mandate 6’ Fall Protection, then Section “6 Mandatory 6’ Fall Protection” contained in the SEWUP Project Insurance Manual will control.

J. Noncompliance and Unsafe Practices  
District or their representative shall have the authority to immediately cease any and all operation(s) on the jobsite that is deemed by District or their representative to be unsafe to property or has the potential to cause Bodily Injury, pursuant to Title VIII California Code of Regulation, Section 1511. Any such cessation of work shall not constitute recoverable delay or other contractual remedies for liquidated damages and may expose the offending contractor to any such losses to the District or other trades.

K. Professional Conduct Clause  
Entity and subcontractors shall at all times adhere to safety requirements (contractual and regulatory) and shall ensure all safe and professional behavior among their employees. Entity and subcontractors shall not allow on the job site any unfit person, unsafe person, anyone unskilled and unqualified to perform the work assigned to them, or anyone exhibiting such qualities. Any person in the employ of the contractor or subcontractor whom the District or the District’s agent/representative may deem incompetent, unsafe, or unfit shall be immediately dismissed from the OCIP job site and shall not again be allowed on the OCIP job site except with the written consent of District or the District’s agent/representative. The District reserves the right to request that the contractor or subcontractor’s assigned Project Supervisor/Manager be replaced immediately.

1.17 DISTRICT’S INSURANCE OBLIGATIONS; ENTITY’S/SUBCONTRACTORS’ OBLIGATIONS; REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND DISCLAIMERS  
(a) District assumes no obligation to provide insurance other than that summarily described in these Contractual Provisions, in the Project Insurance Manual, and in the OCIP insurance policies. Entity/Subcontractor shall review the OCIP coverages, limits of liability, and insurance policies to satisfy themselves that the coverages offered thereby meet its needs. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to place any responsibility on District, and District disclaims any responsibility, for ensuring that the insurance provided by the OCIP is sufficient for the conduct of Entity’s/Subcontractor’s business or performance of the Work, including, without limitation, the adequacy of the limits of liability provided by, and as to all other terms, conditions and exclusions of, the OCIP insurance policies. The furnishing of insurance by District through the OCIP shall in no way relieve or limit or be construed to relieve or limit Entity/Subcontractor of any responsibility, liability or obligation imposed by the Facilities and Site Lease, the Contract Documents, the Project Insurance Manual, the OCIP insurance policies, or by law, including, without limitation, all indemnification obligations on the part of Entity/Subcontractor.
<!-- Page 77 -->
![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+B)  
(b) By enrolling in the OCIP, Entity/Subcontractor acknowledges that (i) the limits of liability of the OCIP insurance policies are shared by all insured parties under the OCIP; (ii) District is not an insurer or in the business of insurance and is not an agent, broker, partner, or guarantor of Entity/Subcontractor or any of the insurance companies providing coverage under the OCIP (the “OCIP insurers”); and (iii) District is not responsible for (a) the availability, adequacy, or exhaustion of the limits of the OCIP, (b) the present or future solvency of any of the OCIP insurers or (c) any claims or disputes by, between, or among District, Entity, Subcontractor(s), and/or any of the OCIP insurers, including, without limitation, claims or disputes arising out of any of the OCIP insurers’ payment or nonpayment of claims or losses, or such insurers’ contractual or extra-contractual duties, including, without limitation, defense and/or indemnity obligations. Any type of insurance coverage or limits of liability not provided by the OCIP which Entity/Subcontractor believes is prudent and desires for its own protection, or which is required by applicable laws or regulations, shall be its sole responsibility and expense and shall not be included in the Total Base Rent. If Contractor/Subcontractor believes that additional limits of liability beyond those provided by the OCIP would be prudent for its protection, the OCIP does not in any way prevent Contractor/Subcontractor from procuring such additional limits of liability for itself at its sole cost.

(c) Submitting documentation to enroll in the OCIP indicates the representation and agreement that Entity/Subcontractor has had the opportunity to read and analyze (and to obtain professional assistance to read and analyze) a copy of the OCIP insurance policies and understand the contents thereof. Any reference in the Facilities Lease, the Project Insurance Manual, or elsewhere in any contract document as to amount, nature, type, or extent of coverage provided under the OCIP and/or potential applicability to any potential claim or loss is for reference only and Entity/Subcontractor shall not rely upon such reference or any other oral or written statement by or on behalf of District, the Project Administrator, or any of its or their agents, employees, or representatives, but solely upon its own review and analysis of the OCIP insurance policies in formulating any understanding and/or belief as to amount, type or extent of any coverage, conditions, extensions, or limits of liability provided by and as to all other terms of the OCIP insurance policies and/or their potential applicability to any claim or loss or their sufficiency for the conduct of Entity’s/Subcontractor’s business or performance under the Facility Lease. To the extent that Entity/Subcontractor deems it prudent to secure and maintain additional, supplemental, excess, or wholly independent insurance associated with its Work on the Project or otherwise, such insurance shall be at its sole expense.

(d) Entity/Subcontractor hereby releases District, the Program Administrator, and their respective representatives, agents, directors, officers, employees, partners, shareholders, members, affiliates of every tier, successors, and assigns from any and all claims and liabilities arising out of or relating to acts, errors, omissions or negligence (i) in the design, selection, placement, adequacy, amount, limits, scope and nature of insurance coverage afforded by the OCIP, (ii) in the selection, performance and present and future solvency of the OCIP insurers, and (iii) in the implementation and administration of the OCIP. Entity/Subcontractor shall make its own determinations regarding such matters and expressly waives all rights and benefits conferred upon it by the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542, which provides:

A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.

By executing the Facilities and Site Lease or Subcontract, as applicable, to which this Exhibit is appended and by submitting documentation to enroll in the OCIP, Entity/Subcontractor expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver of the provisions of Section 1542 was separately bargained for, and expressly agrees that the release provision shall be given full force and effect, including, without limitation, as to unknown or

1.18 JOINT DEFENSE OF CLAIMS AND SUITS AGAINST MORE THAN ONE INSURED

(a) If a claim, demand, suit, or other proceeding (“Claim”) is brought against more than one insured under the OCIP, District and Entity/Subcontractor recognize the common interest of all OCIP insureds in jointly defending that Claim. To the fullest extent permitted by law, and absent a material, current, actual, and unwaivable conflict of interest mandating the appointment of separate counsel under applicable law, District and Entity/Subcontractor insured under the OCIP (i) shall be defended by the same counsel and by the same consultants and experts selected by District and/or the OCIP insurers at their sole discretion, regardless of whether the defense under the OCIP is provided subject to a reservation of rights issued by any OCIP insurer, and (ii) waive their respective rights to independent counsel as to any and all such Claims. This waiver is deemed to be continuing. Entity/Subcontractor agrees to execute such other documents as are required to effectuate this waiver and fulfill the purpose of this Section 1.18.

(b) In defense of Claims arising under the OCIP, information shared with counsel engaged to defend the insureds (“Defense Counsel”) will be protected from disclosure and shall remain privileged even after the termination of the OCIP and/or the completion of the Project and/or the termination of the Facilities and Site Lease. Entity/Subcontractor agrees not to disclose to any person or entity, other than to District and to Defense Counsel, any confidential information obtained in the defense or pursuit of Claims covered, or potentially covered, under the OCIP. Any such confidential information shall only be used in matters that arise directly pursuant to such OCIP Claims. However, disclosures of such confidential information may be made (i) upon written approval from Defense Counsel or (ii) where required or permitted by applicable law.

(c) Nothing in this Section 1.18 shall preclude Entity/Subcontractors from engaging counsel of its choice, at its sole expense, to associate in the defense of any such Claim.

1.19 Duty of Care  
Nothing contained in the OCIP insurance policies, the Facilities and Site Lease (including this Exhibit), any other Contract Document, or the Project Insurance Manual shall relieve Entity/Subcontractor of its obligations to exercise due care in the performance of its duties in connection with the Work and to complete the Work in strict compliance with the Contract Documents.

NOTE: THE DISTRICT AND PROGRAM ADMINISTRATOR MUST APPROVE CHANGES TO ANY OCIP REQUIREMENT OR PROCEDURE. NEITHER ENTITY NOR ANY SUBCONTRACTOR HAS THE AUTHORITY TO AMEND THE OCIP REQUIREMENTS.

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board review and discuss proposed changes to the Local Control and Accountability Plan Parent Advisory Committee (LCAP PAC) bylaws.  

Action anticipated: 09/13/2022  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The LCAP PAC was created in 2014 and has evolved over the years since to consult and advise the board on the district’s local control accountability plan. In hearing feedback from current and former committee members as well as thoughts from members of the board during previous board discussions, district staff have worked to propose revised bylaws for the committee that clarify its purpose, function, and membership selection.  

Under the revised bylaws, the committee will be composed of 20 members. Each member of the board of education will appoint two members. The superintendent will appoint two community members and four student members. The revisions also clarify the expected time commitment of committee members and the process of members meeting outside of fully agendized meetings.

## LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN  
### PARENT ADVISORY COMMITTEE BYLAWS

I. Name  
The name of the committee shall be the Local Control and Accountability Plan Parent Advisory Committee (LCAP PAC).

II. Background  
In 2013, the California Department of Education (CDE) revised the Education Code to develop the new California School Accountability System, and establish the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP). LCFF is used to allocate state funding to all school districts. This includes base funding for all districts as well as additional supplemental and concentration grants based on the unduplicated number of English learner, low income, and foster youth students.

The LCAP is used to show how LCFF funding will be spent by a school district to improve student outcomes. The LCAP shall demonstrate how services are provided to meet the needs of unduplicated English learner, low income, and foster youth students, and improve the performance of all pupils in the state priority areas (5 CCR section 15494). This LCAP must address state and local priorities identified pursuant to Education Code section 52060(d).

III. Authority  
The Local Control and Accountability Plan Parent Advisory Committee, defined in Education Code section 52063, hereinafter referred to as “the committee,” is a standing committee of the San Juan Unified School District Board of Education as established by formal board action and shall operate in compliance with the state’s open-meeting laws (Greene Act, Education Code section 35147) and the requirements of these bylaws. In this regard, a majority of committee members may meet at the same time and place to hear, discuss, or deliberate upon any matter within the function of the committee, but shall not take any action on any item of business outside of the District scheduled public meetings.

IV. Charge  
As directed by the board, superintendent or designee, the committee shall serve at the pleasure of the Board of Education in an advisory capacity on matters pertaining to the LCAP as specified in Education Code section 52063.

V. Function: LCAP PAC  
The LCAP PAC is considered one of multiple educational partners which the superintendent and board consults with and seeks advice from in the development and revision of the LCAP. It is the board’s expectation that the LCAP PAC shall fulfill the charge of the committee pursuant to California Education Code.

California Education Code requires that districts shall:  
- “consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, local bargaining units of the school district, parents, and pupils in developing a local control and accountability plan.” [Section 52060(g)]  
- “present the local control and accountability plan or annual update to the local control and accountability plan to the parent advisory committee established pursuant to Section 52063 for review and comment.” [Section 52062(a)(1)]  

“Consult” [Education Code section 52060(g)] and “advice” [Education Code section 52063(a)(1)] are defined as:  
- District gathering the perspectives and insights of educational partners as they relate to the LCAP through the district educational partner engagement strategy, which includes surveys and listening sessions.  
- LCAP PAC reviewing and providing comment on the development of the LCAP pursuant to Section 52062(a)(1).

**AGENDA ITEM:** I-3  
**MEETING DATE:** 08/23/2022  

**SUBJECT:** Exemption to the Separation-From-Service Requirement  
**DEPARTMENT:** Human Resources  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt Resolution No. 4032 for Exemption to the Separation-From-Service requirement pursuant to Education Code section 24214.5 or 26812.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
In response to concerns about the difficulty employers are having in hiring substitute teachers during the current teacher shortage, the existing law provides for an Exemption to the Separation-From-Service requirement imposed immediately after retirement, if the retired CalSTRS Defined Benefit Program member or Cash Balance Benefit Program participant receiving an annuity is hired in a critically needed position and meets other eligibility criteria. To meet one of the requirements of the exemption qualification, the governing board of the employee must approve the retired CalSTRS member or participant appointment by adopting a resolution in a public meeting. Thus, by adopting the resolution, the governing board will be providing retired certificated employees the ability to work as a substitute teacher without waiting the required 180 calendar days.

## RESOLUTION FOR EXEMPTION TO THE SEPARATION-FROM-SERVICE REQUIREMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION 24214.5 OR 26812 OF THE EDUCATION CODE

### Resolution No. 4032

WHEREAS, pursuant to Education Code section 24214.5 and 26812, there is a 180 calendar day separation-from-service requirement for all retired CalSTRS members and participants; and,

WHEREAS, all retired CalSTRS members and participants are subject to a restriction if they perform retired member activities as defined by section 22164.5 of the Education Code or retired participant activities as defined by section 26135.7 of the Education Code, during the first 180 calendar days after their most recent retirement; and,

WHEREAS, if the retired CalSTRS member or participant performed retired member or participant activities during this period, CalSTRS will reduce his or her retirement benefit or annuity one dollar for each dollar earned for performing retired member or participant activities during the 180-day period; and,

WHEREAS, there is an exemption from the 180 calendar day separation-from-service requirement for a member or participant who retires for service and is at or above normal retirement age; and,

WHEREAS, in order to qualify for this narrow exemption, the employer must appoint the retired member or participant to a critically needed position that has been approved by the governing body of the employer in a public meeting as reflected in a resolution; and,

WHEREAS, this approval by the governing body of the employer in a public meeting as reflected in a resolution must be finalized and communicated to CalSTRS before the member or participant commences to perform retired member or participant activities; and,

WHEREAS, the Superintendent must complete the Request for Separation-from-Service Requirement Exemption form, which must be submitted to CalSTRS and received by CalSTRS before the member or participant commences to perform retired member or participant activities;

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that this Board does provide public notice that the district is in critical need of substitute teachers to teach because there is a lack of qualified substitute teachers;

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board wishes to meet this critical need by hiring Marcia Ortega and Margaret Stroh, members or participants who retired for service less than 180 days ago or who will retire;

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this appointment is needed to fill this critical need before the 180 calendar day separation-from-service requirement is fulfilled;

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this member or participant did not receive a retirement incentive or any financial inducement to retire from any public employer;
<!-- Page 100 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the earnings for retired member activities during the 180 calendar days will still be subject to the annual postretirement earnings limit for the Defined Benefit Program;  

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this member or participant will not commence to perform retired member or participant activities before this approval is authorized by the governing body of the employer in a public meeting as reflected in a resolution and received by CalSTRS;  

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this member or participant will not commence to perform retired member or participant activities before the Superintendent completes the Request for Separation-from-Service Requirement Exemption form and this is transmitted to and received by CalSTRS.

Bylaw 9270: Conflict of Interest  
Original Adopted Date: 06/09/1992 | Last Revised Date: 08/24/2021 | Last Reviewed Date: 08/24/2021  

The Governing Board desires to maintain the highest ethical standards and help ensure that decisions are made in the best interest of the district and the public. No board member, district employee, or other person in a designated position shall participate in the making of any decision for the district when the decision will or may be affected by their financial, family, or other personal interest or consideration.

In accordance with law, board members shall disclose any conflict of interest and, as necessary, shall abstain from participating in the decision.

Even if a prohibited conflict of interest does not exist, a board member shall abstain from voting on personnel matters that uniquely affect their relatives. However, a board member may vote on collective bargaining agreements and personnel matters that affect a class of employees to which their relative belongs. Relative means an adult who is related to the board member by blood or affinity within the third degree, as determined by the common law, or an individual in an adoptive relationship within the third degree. (Education Code section 35107) A relationship within the third degree includes an individual's parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, nephews, and the similar family of the individual's spouse/registered domestic partner unless the individual is widowed or divorced.

Pursuant to 2 CCR 18730, the requirements of the Government Code are satisfied if a district adopts a conflict of interest code that incorporates 2 CCR 18730 by reference, along with a list of designated positions and disclosure categories. The accompanying exhibit (E 9270) includes an appendix with designated positions and disclosure categories which comprise the terms of the district's conflict of interest code that is submitted to the code reviewing body for approval, in accordance with Government Code section 87303, and within the deadline for submission established by the code reviewing body. (Government Code section 87303)

Upon direction by the code reviewing body, the board shall review the district's conflict of interest code and submit any changes to the code reviewing body, or if no change is required, the board shall submit a written statement to that effect. (Government Code section 87306.5)

When a change in the district's conflict of interest code is necessitated due to changed circumstances, such as the creation of new designated positions, changes to the duties assigned to existing positions, amendments, or revisions, the amended code shall be submitted to the code reviewing body within 90 days after the changed circumstances necessitating the amendments have become apparent. (Government Code section 87306)

When reviewing and preparing the district's conflict of interest code, the superintendent or designee shall provide officers, employees, consultants, and members of the community adequate notice and a fair opportunity to present their views. (Government Code section 87311)

Board members and designated employees shall annually file a Statement of Economic Interest/Form 700 in accordance with the disclosure categories specified in the district's conflict of interest code. A board member who leaves office or a designated employee who leaves district employment shall, within 30 days, file a revised statement covering the period of time between the closing date of the last statement and the date of leaving office or district employment. (Government Code sections 87302, 87302.6)

**Conflict of Interest under the Political Reform Act**  
A board member, designated employee, or other person in a designated position shall not make, participate in making, or in any way use or attempt to use their official position to influence a governmental decision in which they know or have reason to know that they have a disqualifying conflict of interest. A disqualifying conflict of interest exists if the decision will have a "reasonably foreseeable material financial effect," which is distinguishable from the effect on the public generally, on the board member, designated employee, or other person in a designated position.

their immediate family, or any financial interest described in 2 CCR 18700. (Government Code sections 87100, 87101, 87103; 2 CCR 18700-18707)

A board member, designated employee, or other person in a designated position makes a governmental decision when, acting within the authority of their office or position, they authorize or direct any action on a matter, vote, or provide information or opinion on it, contact, or appear before a district official for the purpose of affecting the decision, or takes any other action specified in 2 CCR 18704.

However, a board member shall participate in the making of a contract in which they have a financial interest if their participation is required by the rule of necessity or legally required participation pursuant to Government Code section 87101 and 2 CCR 18705.

A board member who has a disqualifying conflict of interest on an agenda item that will be heard in an open meeting of the board shall abstain from voting on the matter. They may remain on the dais, but their presence shall not be counted towards achieving a quorum for that matter. A board member with a disqualifying conflict of interest shall not be present during a closed session meeting of the board when the decision is considered and shall not obtain or review a recording or any other nonpublic information regarding the issue.

**Conflict of Interest under Government Code section 1090 - Financial Interest in a Contract**

Board members, employees, or district consultants shall not be financially interested in any contract made by the board on behalf of the district, including in the development, preliminary discussions, negotiations, compromises, planning, reasoning, and specifications and solicitations for bids. If a board member has such a financial interest in a contract made by the board, the contract is void. (Government Code section 1090)

Board members who willfully fail to disclose a remote interest in a contract may be subject to a fine or imprisonment pursuant to Government Code section 1097.

A board member shall not be considered to be financially interested in a contract in which they have only a "remote interest," as specified in Government Code section 1091, if the remote interest is disclosed during a board meeting and noted in the official board minutes. The affected board member shall not vote or debate on the matter or attempt to influence any other board member or district official to enter into the contract. (Government Code section 1091)

A board member shall not be considered to be financially interested in a contract in which their interest is a "noninterest" as defined in Government Code section 1091.5. Noninterest includes a board member's interest in being reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties, in the employment of their spouse/registered domestic partner who has been a district employee for at least one year prior to the board member's election or appointment, or in any other applicable circumstance specified in Government Code section 1091.5.

**Common Law Doctrine Against Conflict of Interest**

A board member shall abstain from any official action in which their private or personal interest may conflict with their official duties.

**Incompatible Offices and Activities**

Board members shall not engage in any employment or activity or hold any office which is inconsistent with, incompatible with, or injurious to the board member's duties as an officer of the district. (Government Code sections 1099, 1126)

**Gifts**

Board members and designated employees may accept gifts only under the conditions and limitations specified in Government Code section 89503 and 2 CCR 18730.

The limitation on gifts does not apply to wedding gifts and gifts exchanged between individuals on birthdays, holidays, and other similar occasions, provided that the gifts exchanged are not substantially disproportionate in value. (Government Code section 89503)
<!-- Page 104 -->
![Image](https://simbi.eboardsolutions.com/SU/ckslhWTo/GinoK4QViBtLug==)

The limitation on gifts does not apply to informational materials such as books, reports, pamphlets, calendars, and periodicals. (Government Code section 82028)

Gifts of travel and related lodging and subsistence shall be subject to the current gift limitation except when: (Government Code section 89506)

1. The travel is in connection with a speech given by a board member or designated employee, provided the lodging and subsistence expenses are limited to the day immediately preceding, the day of, and the day immediately following the speech, and the travel is within the United States.

2. The travel is provided by a person or agency specified in Government Code section 89506, including a government, governmental agency or authority, bona fide public or private educational institution, as defined in Revenue and Taxation Code section 203, or nonprofit organization exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Gifts of travel exempted from the gift limitation, as described in items #1 and 2, above, shall nevertheless be reportable on the recipient’s Statement of Economic Interest/Form 700 as required by law.

A gift of travel does not include travel provided by the district for board members and designated employees. (Government Code section 89506)

Honoraria

Board members and designated employees shall not accept any honorarium, which is defined as any payment made in consideration for any speech given, article published, or attendance at any public or private gathering, in accordance with law. (Government Code sections 89501, 89502)

The term honorarium does not include: (Government Code section 89501)

1. Earned income for personal services customarily provided in connection with a bona fide business, trade, or profession unless the sole or predominant activity of the business, trade, or profession is making speeches.

2. Any honorarium which is not used and, within 30 days after receipt, is either returned to the donor or delivered to the district for donation into the general fund without being claimed as a deduction from income for tax purposes.
