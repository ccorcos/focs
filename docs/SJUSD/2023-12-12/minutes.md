**Amending District Graduation Requirements for the Class of 2024 (K-1)**  
Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Education and Programs Kristan Schnepp gave a presentation regarding amending the district’s graduation requirements for the Class of 2024. Ms. Schnepp provided historical context, noting that in 2016 the board approved increasing graduation requirements starting with the Class of 2023, which included additional courses in mathematics, science, and world language; however, with school closures occurring due to COVID-19, the disruption to students’ education has impacted many of the current seniors and there is no state legislation to support the Class of 2024. Ms. Schnepp said that staff reviewed current data for seniors and gathered input from staff, students, and the community, and ultimately determined that there was a need to reduce the number of credits needed to graduate. Ms. Schnepp explained that the recommended graduation requirement for the Class of 2024 is 160 credits. Staff answered questions from the board. Board members made comments and posed questions regarding the block versus traditional schedules, the graduation advisory committee, the timing of the recommendation, current data and credit recovery options, acknowledging that it may take some time to get back to the board-adopted graduation requirements that were approved in 2016. After board discussion, it was agreed that the item would return for action as a business item on January 9.

The First Interim Report reflects the multi-year budget projections for years 2024-2025 and 2025-2026. Board members made comments and expressed appreciation for the positive certification. It was moved by Ms. Villescaz, seconded by Mr. Perez, to approve the 2023-2024 First Interim Report with the positive certification of the district’s ability to meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year and subsequent two fiscal years. **MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY** [Costa, Hernandez, Avey, Villescaz, Kravchuk, Perez, Creason].

**2022-2023 Audit Report (K-3)**  
Ms. Blandford shared that the completion of the 2022-2023 audit report is delayed because the district submitted a request for an extension to file the Annual Audit and Financial Statements with the California Department of Education (CDE). Ms. Blandford explained that the district previously filed a J-13A waiver form with the CDE for lost attendance days at Barrett Middle School and Grand Oaks Elementary School in January 2023 due to severe storms in the region; however, the CDE currently has more than 600 forms pending approval, and the district’s waiver has not yet been approved. Ms. Blandford conveyed that the district’s external audit firm, Crowe LLP, will provide a final audit report once the waiver is approved, which the anticipated timeframe is between December 2023 and March 2024.
