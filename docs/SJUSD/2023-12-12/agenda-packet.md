Career Technical Education: Before establishing a career technical education training program, each member of a local adult education consortium, or the consortium as a whole, shall conduct a job market study of the labor market area in which it proposes to establish the career technical education training program or rely upon the most recent job market study of the labor market area conducted by the local workforce development board. The study shall use local labor market information and consider a supply analysis of existing career technical education training programs for adults maintained by high schools, community colleges, and other postsecondary educational institutions in the geographic area to ensure that the anticipated employment demand for adults enrolled in the proposed training program justifies the establishment of the proposed courses of instruction (EC 84906(a)(3)(A)).

WHEREAS, the District has adopted the uniform public construction cost accounting procedures set forth in the Uniform Public Construction Cost Accounting Act set forth at California Public Contact Code Section 22000 et seq.

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Act, if a public entity adopts the uniform public construction cost accounting procedures, per Public Contract Code Section 22050 in the case of an emergency, when any repairs, alterations, work, or improvement is necessary to any facility of public schools to permit the continuance of existing school classes, or to avoid danger to life or property; such public agency may, in its discretion, delegate to an administrative officer of such public agency the authority to repair or replace a public facility, take any directly related and immediate action required by such emergency, and procure any necessary equipment, services, and supplies for those purposes, without giving notice for bids to let contracts and without prior notice or approval of the governing board of such public agency.

If a person with such authority orders any action specified under this resolution; that person shall report to the governing board, at its next meeting the reasons justifying why the emergency would not permit a delay resulting from a competitive solicitation for bids and why the action was necessary to respond to the emergency. The board shall review the emergency action at every regularly scheduled meeting thereafter until the action is terminated. The action shall be terminated at the earliest possible date that conditions warrant so that the remainder of the emergency action may be completed by giving notice for bids to let contracts.

NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the governing board of the San Juan Unified School District hereby delegates to the undersigned the authority in case of an emergency to repair or replace a public facility, take any directly related and immediate action required by such emergency, and procure any necessary equipment, services, and supplies for those purposes, without giving notice for bids to let contracts and without prior notice or approval of the governing board of such public agency.

securities law provisions applicable to the Bonds, as to completeness and accuracy.  

h. Assist the School District in presenting information to bond rating agencies and providers of credit enhancement relating to legal issues affecting the issuance of the Bonds.  

i. Such other and further services as are traditionally performed by bond counsel in connection with similar bond financings.  

Attorneys’ Bond Opinion will be delivered by Attorneys on the date the Bonds are exchanged for their purchase price (the ‘Closing’).  

The Bond Opinion will be based on facts and law existing as of its date, will cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities, and will represent Attorneys’ judgment as to the proper treatment of the Bonds for federal income tax purposes. Attorneys’ opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or the courts. Attorneys cannot and will not give any opinion or assurance about the effect of future changes in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”), the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS. School District acknowledges that future legislation, if enacted into law, or clarification of the Code may cause interest on the Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation, or otherwise prevent owners of the Bonds from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such future legislation or clarification of the Code may also affect the market price for, or marketability of, the Bonds. Attorneys will express no opinion regarding any pending or proposed federal tax legislation.  

In rendering the Bond Opinion, Attorneys will rely upon the certified proceedings and other certifications of public officials and other persons furnished to Attorneys without undertaking to verify the same by independent investigation, and Attorneys will assume continuing compliance by the School District with applicable laws relating to the Bonds.  

**Section 3. Scope of Engagement as Disclosure Counsel.** Attorneys shall perform all of the following services as disclosure counsel in connection with the issuance and sale of the Bonds:  

a. Prepare the disclosure document to be reviewed by potential Bond investors, known as the Official Statement (both preliminary and final), or other disclosure documents in connection with the offering of the Bonds.  

b. Confer and consult with the officers and administrative staff of the School District as to matters relating to the Official Statement.  

c. Participate in meetings and calls at which the Official Statement is to be discussed, as deemed necessary by Attorneys for the proper exercise of their due diligence with respect to the Official Statement.  

d. On behalf of the School District, prepare the bond purchase contract or official notice of sale pursuant to which the Bonds will be sold and a continuing disclosure certificate of the School District to assist the underwriter with complying with Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12.  

e. Subject to the completion of proceedings to the satisfaction of Attorneys, provide  
<!-- Page 57 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
a letter of Attorneys addressed to the School District to the effect that, although Attorneys are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the Official Statement and make no representation that Attorneys have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of any such statements, no facts have come to Attorneys' attention that cause Attorneys to believe that the Official Statement as of the date of the Official Statement or the date of delivery of the Bonds contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, provided, however, Attorneys may expressly exclude from the scope of said sentence any financial and statistical data and forecasts, numbers, estimates, assumptions and expressions of opinion, and information concerning a bond insurance policy or bond insurer (if any), and information concerning the Depository Trust Company and the book-entry system for the Bonds, that is contained or incorporated by reference in the Official Statement and the appendices to the Official Statement.

**Section 4. Excluded Services.** Our duties in this agreement are limited to those expressly set forth above in Section 2 and Section 3, except as expressly set forth in a written amendment to this Agreement. Among other things, our duties do not include:

a. Preparing requests for tax rulings from the Internal Revenue Service, or “no-action” letters from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

b. Preparing blue sky or investment surveys with respect to the Bonds, or performing research regarding the School District's pre-issuance and post-issuance compliance with prior undertakings pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12, if any.

c. Drafting state constitutional or legislative amendments.

d. Pursuing test cases or representation in any other litigation, such as contested validation actions, election contests, or other legal challenges which arise during the election proceedings or during the course of the District's bond program.

e. Making an investigation or expressing any view as to the creditworthiness of the School District or the Bonds.

f. Providing advice on financial structuring, market timing or size of the proposed bond issue, other than with respect to legal considerations.

g. After Closing, providing advice concerning any actions necessary to assure compliance with any continuing disclosure undertaking under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12.

h. Representing the School District in Internal Revenue Service examinations, audits or inquiries, or Securities and Exchange Commission investigations.

i. After Closing, unless specifically requested to do so by School District, and agreed to by Attorneys, providing continuing advice to the School District or any other party concerning any actions that need to be taken regarding  
-4-
<!-- Page 58 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the Bonds.

j. Reviewing or opining on the business terms of, validity, or federal tax consequences of any derivative financial products, such as an interest rate swap agreement, that the School District may choose to enter into in connection with the issuance of the Bonds, unless the School District and Attorneys agree on the terms of such review and compensation for such review.

k. Reviewing or opining on architect and/or construction contracts including lease-leaseback construction contracts, or the pursuit of other facilities funding sources such as state bond funds or insurance proceeds.

l. Addressing any other matter not specifically set forth above that is not required to render our Bond Opinion or our services as Disclosure Counsel.

**Section 5. Conflicts; Prospective Consent.** Attorneys represent many political subdivisions, investment banking firms and financial advisory firms. It is possible that during the time that Attorneys are representing the School District, one or more of Attorneys present or future School Districts will have transactions with the School District. Attorneys may be asked to represent, in an unrelated matter, one or more of the entities involved in the issuance of the Bonds. Attorneys do not believe such representation, if it occurs, will adversely affect Attorneys’ ability to represent you as provided in this Agreement, either because such matters will be sufficiently different from the issuance of the Bonds so as to make such representations not adverse to our representation of you, or because the potential for such adversity is remote or minor and outweighed by the consideration that advice given to the other School District will be relevant to any aspect of the issuance of the Bonds. Execution of this Agreement will signify the School District’s consent to Attorneys’ representation of others consistent with the circumstances described in this paragraph.

**Section 6. Compensation.** The following fees apply to the legal services rendered hereunder:

(a) **Legal Services: Election Proceedings.** Pursuant to California Attorney General Opinion No. 13-304 any pre-election services performed outside of the necessary legal processes will be billed separately and paid from a source other than proceeds of the Bonds, and shall not exceed $5,000.

(b) **Bond Counsel Services.** For the services of Attorneys listed in Section 2, the fee per series of bonds shall be determined as follows:

1/2% of the first $5 million principal amount of Bonds, plus  
1/4% of the next $5 million principal amount of Bonds, plus  
1/8% of the remaining principal amount of Bonds.

Notwithstanding the foregoing fee formula, the fee for Bond Counsel shall be capped at $45,000 per series of Bonds issued. Out of pocket costs shall be reimbursed up to an amount of $2,000 per issuance.

(c) **Disclosure Counsel Services.** For the services of Attorneys listed in Section 3, the fee shall be $20,000 per issuance.

**The foregoing fees are not set by law but are negotiable between Attorneys and School District. To the extent School District requires Bond Counsel and/or Disclosure Counsel services in connection with other financings not described herein which Attorneys are qualified to provide, this Agreement may be supplemented by addenda providing the applicable fee.**

### Section 7. Responsibilities of the School District.

(a) **General.** The School District will cooperate with Attorneys and furnish Attorneys with certified copies of all proceedings taken by the School District, or otherwise deemed necessary by Attorneys to render an opinion upon the validity of the proceedings. During the course of this engagement, Attorneys will rely on School District to provide Attorneys with complete and timely information on all developments pertaining to any aspect of the Bonds and their security. Attorneys are not responsible for costs and expenses incurred incidental to the actual issuance and delivery of the Bonds, including the cost of preparing certified copies of proceedings required by Attorneys in connection with the issuance of the Bonds, and printing and publication costs.

(b) **Federal Tax Law-Related Responsibilities.** The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds. As a condition of Attorneys issuing their opinion, School District will be required to make certain representations and covenants to comply with certain restrictions designed to insure that interest on the Bonds will not be included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these covenants may result in interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the Bonds. Attorneys’ opinion will assume the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. Attorneys will not undertake to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions taken (or not taken) or events occurring (or not occurring) after the date of issuance of the Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax status of interest on, the Bonds. In this regard, School District agrees to familiarize itself with the relevant requirements and restrictions necessary for the Bonds to qualify for exemption from federal income taxation and to exercise due diligence both before and after issuance of the Bonds in complying with these requirements.

### Section 8. Independent Contractor.

Attorneys will act as an independent contractor in performing the services required under this Agreement, and under no circumstances shall Attorneys be considered an agent, partner, or employee of the School District.

### Section 9. Assignment.

Attorneys may not assign their rights or delegate their obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, except with the prior written consent of the School District.

### Section 10. Termination of Agreement.

(a) **Termination by School District.** This Agreement may be terminated at any time by the School District with or without cause upon written notice to Attorneys.

(b) **Termination by Attorneys.** This Agreement may be terminated by Attorneys upon 15 days’ written notice to School District if School District fails to follow written legal advice given by Attorneys.

(c) **Termination Upon Issuance of Final Series of Bonds.** This Agreement shall terminate upon the issuance of the final series of Bonds pursuant to the authorization described herein.

(d) Consequences of Termination. In the event of termination, all finished and unfinished documents shall at the option of the School District become its property and shall be delivered to the School District by Attorneys.

![Lease Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Lease+Agreement)  
Date, whichever first occurs ("Start Date"), and, so long as the required service contracts described in Paragraph 7.1(b) below are obtained by Lessee and in effect during the following the Start Date, warrants that the existing electrical, plumbing, fire sprinkler, lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems ("HVAC"), loading doors, sump pumps, if any, and all other such elements in the Premises, other than those constructed by Lessee, shall be in good operating condition and state, that the surface and structural elements of the roof, bearing walls and foundation of any building on the Premises ("Building") shall be free of material defects, and that the Unit does not contain hazardous or any mold or fungi or toxic under applicable state or federal law. If a non-compliance with said warranty exists as of the Start Date, or if the use of such systems or premises should malfunction for all within the appropriate warranty period, Lessor shall, at Lessor's sole obligation with respect to such matter, except as otherwise provided in this lease, promptly after receipt written notice from Lessee setting forth with specificity the nature and extent of such non-compliance, malfunction or failure, rectify same at Lessor's expense. The warranty periods shall be as follows: (i) 6 months as to the HVAC system, and (ii) 30 days as to the remaining systems and other elements of the Building. If Lessee does not discover the required notice within the appropriate warranty period, correcting any of such non-compliance, malfunction or failure shall be the obligation of Lessee at Lessee's sole cost and expense, except for the roof, foundations, and bearings which are handled as provided in paragraph 7. Lessor also warrants, that unless otherwise specified in writing, Lessor is unaware of (i) any recorded Notices of Default affecting the Premise; (ii) any delinquent amounts due under any loan secured by the Premises; and (iii) any bankruptcy proceeding affecting the Premises.  
2.3 Compliance. Lessee warrants that to the best of its knowledge the improvements on the Premises comply with the building codes, applicable laws, covenants or restrictions of record, regulations, and ordinances ("Applicable Requirements") that were in effect at the time that each improvement, or portion thereof, was constructed. Said warranty does not apply to the use to which Lessee will put the Premises, modifications which may be required by the Americans with Disabilities Act or any similar laws as a result of Lessee's use (see Paragraph 5.0), or for any alterations or Utility Installations (as defined in Paragraph 7.3(a)) made or to be made by Lessee. NOTE: Lessee is responsible for determining whether or not the Applicable Requirements, and especially the zoning, are appropriate for Lessee's intended use, and acknowledges that past uses of the Premises may no longer be allowed. If the Premises do not comply with said warranty, Lessor shall, except as otherwise provided, promptly after receipt of written notice from Lessee setting forth with specificity the nature and extent of such non-compliance, rectify the same at Lessor's expense. If Lessee does not give Lessor written notice of a non-compliance with this warranty within 6 months following the Start Date, correction of that non-compliance shall be the obligation of Lessee at Lessee's sole cost and expense. The Applicable Requirements are hereafter changed so as to require during the term of this Lease the construction of additional improvements to the Premises and/or Lessor, the remediation of any Hazardous Substances, or the enforcement of other material modification of the Unit, Premises or any other property, Lessor shall allocate the cost of such.  
5. Subject to Paragraph 2.3(c) below, if such Capital Expenditure is required to be made in order to use the Premises by Lessee as intended for uses by tenants in general, Lessee shall be fully responsible for the cost of such Capital Expenditure, provided, however, that if such Capital Expenditure is required to be made within 10 days after receipt of Lessee's termination notice that Lessee is not renewing the term unless Lessee has given Lessor written notice to Lessee unless Lessor notifies Lessee in writing of the difference between the actual cost thereof and an amount equal to 6 months' Rent. If Lessee elects to terminate, Lessee shall immediately cease using the Premises and shall pay Lessor the amount owing regarding a termination date at least 90 days thereafter. Lessee shall, however, in no event be earlier than the last day that Lessee could legally utilize the Premises without commencing such Capital Expenditure.  
6. Lessee shall pay for such Capital Expenditure in the manner set forth in this Lease or if Lessee reasonably determines that it is not economically feasible to pay its share thereof, Lessor shall have the option to terminate this Lease upon 90 days prior written notice to Lessee unless Lessee notifies Lessor, in writing, within 45 days after receipt of Lessor's termination notice that Lessee will pay such Capital Expenditure. If Lessee does not elect to terminate, and fails to tender its share of any such Capital Expenditure, Lessee may advance such funds and deduct same, with interest, from Rent until Lessor's share of such costs have been fully paid. If Lessee is unable to finance Lessor's share, or if the balance of the Rent due and payable for the remainder of the lease is not sufficient to fully reimburse Lessee on an interest basis, Lessee shall have the right to terminate this Lease upon 90 days written notice to Lessor.  
(c) Notwithstanding the above, the provisions concerning Capital Expenditures are intended to apply not to non-voluntary, unexpected, and new Applicable Requirements. If the Capital Expenditures are instead triggered by a result of an actual or proposed change in use, change in intensity of use, or modification to the Premises then, and in that event, Lessee shall either: (i) immediately cease such changed use or intensity of use and/or take such other steps as may be necessary to eliminate the requirement for such Capital Expenditure, or (ii) complete such Capital Expenditure at its own expense. Lessee shall not, however, have any right to terminate this lease.  
2.4 Acknowledgements. Lessee acknowledges that: (a) it has been given an opportunity to inspect and measure the Premises, (b) it has been advised by Lessor and/or Brokers to satisfy itself with respect to the size and condition of the Premises including (but not limited to the electrical, HVAC and fire sprinkler systems, security, environmental aspects, and compliance with Applicable Requirements and the Americans with Disabilities Act), and their suitability for Lessee's intended use, (c) Lessee has made such investigation as it deems necessary with reference to such matters and assumes all responsibility therefor as the same relates to its occupancy of the Premises, (d) it is not relying on any representations as to the size of the Premises made by Brokers or Lessor, (e) the square footage of the Premises was not material to Lessee's decision to lease the Premises and pay the Rent stated herein, and (f) neither Lessor, Lessor's agents, nor Brokers have made any oral or written representations or warranties with respect to said matters other than as set forth in this Lease. In addition, Lessee acknowledges that: (i) Brokers have made no representations, promises or warranties concerning Lessee's ability to honor the Lease or suitability to occupy the Premises, and (ii) it is Lessee's sole responsibility to investigate the financial capability and/or suitability of all proposed tenants.  
2.5 Lessee as Prior Owner/Occupant. The warranties made by Lessor in Paragraph 2 shall be of no force or effect if immediately prior to the Start Date Lessee was the owner or occupant of the Premises. In such event, Lessee shall be responsible for any necessary corrective work.  
3. Term.  
3.1 Term. The Commencement Date, Expiration Date and Original Term of this Lease are specified in Paragraph 1.3.  
3.2 Early Possession. Any provision herein granting Lessee Early Possession of the Premises is subject to and conditioned upon the Premises being available for such possession prior to the Commencement Date. Any grant of Early Possession conveys no non-exclusive right to occupy the Premises. If Lessee totally or partially occupies the Premises prior to the Commencement Date, the obligation to pay Base Rent and Property Taxes and insurance and maintain the Premises shall be in effect during such period. Any such Early Possession shall not affect the Expiration Date.  
3.3 Delay in Possession. Lessee agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver exclusive possession of the Premises to Lessee by the Commencement Date. If, despite said efforts, Lessor is unable to deliver possession by such date, Lessor shall not be subject to any liability therefor, nor shall such

Lessees's exclusive use, no matter where located, and Alterations in good order, condition and repair (whether or not the portion of the Premises requiring repairs, or the means of repairing the same, are reasonably or readily accessible to Lessee, and whether or not the need for such repairs arises as a result of Lessee's use, any prior use, the elements or the age of such portion of the Premises), including but not limited to, all equipment or facilities, such as plumbing, HVAC equipment, electrical lighting fixtures, boilers, pressure vessels, fire protection systems, fixtures, walls (interior and exterior), ceilings, floors, stairs, windows, doors, plate glass, skylights, landscaping, driveways, parking lots, fences, retaining walls, signs, sidewalks and parkway located on, or adjacent to the Premises.

However, Lessor reserves the right, upon notice to Lessee, to procure and maintain any or all such service contracts, and Lessee shall reimburse Lessor, upon demand, for the cost thereof.

(c) Failure to Perform. If Lessee fails to perform Lessee's obligations under this Paragraph 7.1, Lessor may enter upon the Premises after 10 days' written notice to Lessee (except in the case of an emergency, in which case no notice shall be required), perform such obligations on Lessee's behalf, and put the Premises in good order, condition and repair, and Lessee shall promptly pay to Lessor a sum equal to 115% of the cost thereof.

(d) Reimbursement. Subject to Lessee's indemnification of Lessor as set forth in Paragraph 8.7 below, and without relieving Lessee of its liability resulting from Lessee's failure to exercise and perform good maintenance practices, if an item described in Paragraph 7.1(b) cannot be repaired other than at a cost which is in excess of 50% of the cost of replacing such item, then such item shall be replaced by Lessor, and Lessee shall reimburse the Parties as described below, to be eligible to pay each month during the unamortized balance of the cost of replacement, the amount on the basis of the cost of the product of multiplying the cost of such replacement by a fraction, the numerator of which is the date on which the Parties are in receipt of the notice, and the denominator of which is 144 (i.e., 1/144th of the cost per month). 

7.2 Lessor's Obligations. Subject to the provisions of Paragraph 2.2 (Conditions), 2.3 (Compliance) and 14 (Condemnation) and 14 (Destruction), it is understood by the Parties hereto that Lessor have no obligation, in any manner, to repair and maintain the Premises, the equipment thereof, all which obligations are the responsibility of Lessee, except for the repair and maintenance of the roof, foundations and bearings walls, all of which respective obligations are to be performed in accordance and pursuant to the terms of this lease govern the respective obligations of the Parties.

Any Alterations or Utility Installations that Lessee is entitled to make and which require the consent of the Lessor shall be presented to Lessor in writing form with detailed plans. Consent shall be deemed conditioned upon Lessee's: (i) acquiring all applicable governmental permits, (ii) furnishing Lessor with copies of such permits and the plans and specifications prior to the commencement of the work, and (iii) completion of said work and other applicable Requirements in a prompt and expeditious manner.

If Lessor shall require, Lessee shall furnish a surety bond in an amount equal to 150% of the amount of such contested lien, claim or demand, indemnifying Lessor against liability for the same. If Lessor elects to participate in any such action, Lessee shall pay Lessor's attorneys' fees and costs.

7.4 Ownership; Removal; Surrender; and Restoration.

(a) Ownership. Subject to Lessor's right to require removal of elect ownership as hereinafter provided, Alterations and Utility Installations made by Lessee shall be the property of Lessee, but considered a part of the Premises.

![Insurance Policies](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Insurance+Policies)

8.5  Insurance Policies.  Insurance required herein shall be by companies maintaining during the policy term a "General Policyholders Rating" of at least A-, VII, as set forth in the most current issue of "Best's Insurance Guide", or such other rating as may be required by a Lender. Lessee shall not be permitted to do anything which invalidates the required insurance policies. Lessee shall, prior to the Start Date, deliver to Lessor certified copies of policies of such insurance or certificates with copies of the required endorsements evidencing the existence and amounts of the required insurance. No such policy shall be cancelable or subject to modification except after 30 days prior written notice to Lessor. Lessee shall, at least 30 days prior to the expiration of such policies, furnish Lessor with evidence of renewal or "insurance binders" evidencing renewal thereof. Lessor may require that Lessee maintain insurance coverage against the risks covered herein, whichever is less. If either Party shall fail to procure and maintain the insurance required to be carried by it, the other Party may, but shall not be required to, procure and maintain the same.

8.6  Waiver of Subrogation.  Without affecting any other rights or remedies, Lessee and Lessor hereby release and waive their entire right to recover damages against the other, for loss of or damage to its property arising out of or incident to the perils required to be insured against herein. The effect of such releases and waivers is not limited by the amount of insurance carried or required, or by any deductibles applicable hereto. The Parties agree to have their respective property damage insurance carriers waive any right to subrogation that such companies may have against Lessor or Lessee, as the case may be, so long as the insurance is not invalidated thereby.

8.7  Indemnity.  Except for Lessor's gross negligence or willful misconduct, Lessee shall indemnify, protect, defend and hold harmless the Premises, Lessor and its agents, Lessor's master or ground lessor, partners and Lenders, from and against any and all claims, loss of rents and/or damages, liens, judgments, penalties, attorneys' and consultants' fees, expenses and/or liabilities arising out of, involving, or in connection with, a Breach of the Lease by Lessee and/or the use and/or occupancy of the Premises and/or Project by Lessee's employees, contractors or invitees. If any action or proceeding is brought against Lessor by reason of any of the foregoing matters, Lessee shall upon notice defend the same at Lessee's expense by counsel reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and shall cooperate with Lessor in such defense. Lessee need not defend Lessor if it has been found guilty of willful misconduct.

8.8  Exemption of Lessor and its Agents from Liability.  Notwithstanding the negligence or breach of this Lease by Lessor or its agents, neither Lessor nor its agents shall be liable for any circumstances for: (i) injury or damage to the person or persons, wares, merchandise or other property of Lessee, Lessee's employees, contractors, invitees, customers, or any other person or entity, or (ii) any injury or damage resulting from fire, steam, electricity, gas, water or rain, indoor air quality, the presence of mold or from the breakage, leakage or obstruction of pipes, fire sprinklers, wires, appliances, plumbing, HVAC or lighting fixtures, or from any other source, or (iii) any loss of income or profits arising from any other portion of the building of which the Premises are a part, or from other sources or places, or (iv) any damage from any act or neglect of any other tenant of Lessor or from the failure of Lessor or its agents to enforce the provisions of this Lease, in the event of (i) through (iv) injuring Lessee's business or for any loss of income or profit therefrom. Instead, it is intended that Lessee's sole recourse in the event of such loss or damage shall be to file a claim on the insurance policies(ies) Lessee is required to maintain pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 8.

8.9  Failure to Provide Insurance.  Lessee acknowledges that should Lessee fail to maintain the required insurance herein, Lessor is not responsible and Lessor shall not incur costs not contemplated herein. Accordingly, for any portion thereof that Lessee does not maintain the required insurance and/or certificates evidencing the existence or the required insurance, Lessee shall be liable for any loss or damage to the Premises or the Project in an amount not to exceed $100, whichever is greater. The parties agree that Base Rent represents fair and reasonable compensation for the assumption of risk by Lessor and its agents. Lessee's failure to maintain the required insurance shall not relieve Lessee of its obligation to indemnify Lessor as set forth herein, nor relieve Lessee of its obligation to maintain the insurance required to be carried by it.

9.  Damage or Destruction.

9.1  Definitions.
(a)  "Premises Partial Damage" shall mean damage or destruction to the improvements on the Premises, other than Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations, which can reasonably be repaired in 6 months or less from the date of damage or destruction. Lessor shall notify Lessee in writing within 10 days from the date of the damage or destruction as to whether or not the damage is Partial Damage.
(b)  "Premises Total Destruction" shall mean damage or destruction to the Premises, other than Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations and Trade Fixtures, which cannot reasonably be repaired in 6 months or less from the date of damage or destruction. Lessor shall notify Lessee in writing within 30 days from the date of the damage or destruction as to whether or not the damage is Partial or Total.
(c)  "Insured Loss" shall mean damage or destruction to the improvements on the Premises, other than Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations, which was caused by an event required to be covered under the insurance described in Paragraph 8.3(a), irrespective of any deductible amounts or coverage limits involved.
(d)  "Replacement Cost" shall mean the cost to repair or rebuild the improvements owned by Lessor at the time of the occurrence to their condition existing immediately prior thereto, including demolition, debris removal and upgrading required by the operation of Applicable Requirements, and without deduction for depreciation.
(e)  "Hazardous Substance Condition" shall mean the occurrence or discovery of a condition involving the presence of, or a contamination by, a Hazardous Substance in, on, or under the Premises which requires restoration.

9.2  Partial Damage- Insured loss. If Premises Partial Damage that is an insured loss occurs, then Lessor shall, at Lessor's expense, repair such damage (but not Lessee's Trade Fixtures or Lessee Owned Alterations and Utility Installations) as soon as reasonably possible and this Lease shall continue in full force and effect; provided, however, that Lessee shall, at Lessor's election, make the repair of any damage or destruction to the total cost of which is $100,000 or less, and, in such event, Lessor shall make any applicable insurance proceeds available to Lessee on a reasonable basis for that purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the required insurance was not in force or the insurance proceeds are not sufficient to effect such repair, the Insuring Party shall promptly continue the insurance process (except as to the deductible which is Lessee's responsibility) as soon as reasonably required to complete repairs. In the event, however, that such damage was due to the fact that, by reason of the unique nature of the improvements, full replacement cost insurance coverage was not commercially reasonable and available, Lessor shall have no obligation to pay for the shortage in insurance proceeds to fully restore the unique aspects of the Premises unless Lessee provides lessor with funds to cover same, or adequate assurance thereof, within 10 days following receiving notice of such shortage and request thereof. If Lessor receives said funds or adequate assurance thereof within said 10 day period, the party responsible for making the repairs shall complete them as soon as reasonably possible and this Lease shall remain in full force and effect. If such funds or assurance are not received, Lessee may nevertheless elect by written notice to Lessee within 10 days thereafter to (i) make such restoration and repair as is commercially reasonable with Lessee paying any shortage in proceeds, in which case this Lease shall remain in full force and effect, or (ii) have this Lease terminate 30 days thereafter. Lessee shall not be entitled to reimbursement of any funds contributed by Lessee to repair any such damage or destruction. Premises Partial Damage due to flood or earthquake shall be subject to Paragraph 9.3, notwithstanding that there may be some insurance.

**13. Default; Breach; Remedies.**  
13.1 **Default; Breach.** A "Default" is defined as a failure by the Lessee to comply with or perform any of the terms, covenants, conditions or Rules and Regulations under this Lease. A "Breach" is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the following Defaults, and the failure of Lessee to cure such Default within any applicable grace period:  
(a) The abandonment of the Premises; the vacating of the Premises prior to the expiration or termination of this Lease without providing a commercially reasonable level of security, or where the coverage of the property insurance described in Paragraph 8.3 is jeopardized as a result thereof, or without providing reasonable assurances to minimize potential vandalism; or failure to deliver to Lessor possession of the entire Premises in accordance herewith prior to the expiration or termination of this Lease.  
(b) The failure of Lessee to make any payment of Rent or any Security Deposit required to be made by Lessee hereunder, whether to Lessor or to a third party, when due, to provide reasonable evidence of insurance or surety bond, or to fulfill any obligation under this Lease which endangers or threatens life or property, where such failure continues for a period of 3 business days following written notice to Lessee. THE ACCEPTANCE BY LESSOR OF A PARTIAL PAYMENT OF RENT OR SECURITY DEPOSIT SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF ANY OF LESSOR'S RIGHTS, INCLUDING LESSOR'S RIGHT TO RECOVER POSSESSION OF THE PREMISES.  
(c) The failure of Lessee to allow Lessor and/or its agents access to the Premises or the commission of waste, act or acts constituting public or private nuisance, and/or an illegal activity on the Premises by Lessee, where such actions continue for a period of 3 business days following written notice to Lessee. In the event that Lessee commits waste, a nuisance or an illegal activity a second time, then the Lessor may elect to treat such conduct as a non-curable Breach rather than a Default.  
(d) The failure by Lessee to provide (i) reasonable written evidence of compliance with Applicable Requirements, (ii) the service contracts, (iii) the rescission of an unauthorized assignment or subletting, (iv) an Expedited Certificate of financial statements, (v) a requested subordination, (vi) evidence concerning any guaranty and/or Guarantor, (vii) any document requested under Paragraph 42, (viii) material safety data sheets (MSDS), or (ix) any other documentation or information which Lessor may reasonably require of Lessee under the terms of this Lease, where any such failure continues for a period of 10 days following written notice.  
(e) The failure of Lessee to pay to Lessor any of its terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of this Lease, where such failure continues for a period of 30 days after written notice; provided, however, that if the nature of Lessee's Default is such that more than 30 days are required for its cure, then it shall not be deemed to be a Breach if Lessee commences such cure within said 30 day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes such cure to completion.  
(f) The occurrence of any of the following events: (i) the making of an arrangement or assignment for the benefit of creditors; (ii) becoming a "debtor" as defined in 11 U.S.C. § 101 or any successor statute thereof; (iii) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to take possession of Lessee's assets located at the Premises or of Lessee's interest in this Lease, where possession is not restored to Lessee within 30 days; or (iv) the attachment, execution or other judicial seizure of substantially all of Lessee's assets located at the Premises in this Lease, where such assets are not released within 30 days; provided, however, that in the event any provision of this Lease is deemed to be in violation of any applicable law, such provision shall be deemed modified to affect the validity of the amendment.  
(g) The failure of Lessee's obligations under this Lease is guaranteed: (i) the death of a Guarantor, (ii) the termination of a Guarantor's liability under this Lease other than in accordance with the terms of this Lease, (iii) a Guarantor's becoming insolvent or the subject of a bankruptcy filing, (iv) a Guarantor's refusal to honor the guaranty, or (v) a Guarantor's breach of its guaranty, which on an anticipatory basis leads to Lessee's failure, within 60 days following written notice of any event, to provide written assurances or security, which when coupled with the then existing resources of Lessee, equals or exceeds the combined financial resources of Lessee and the Guarantors that existed at the time of the execution of this Lease.  
13.2 Remedies. If Lessee fails to perform any of its obligations under this Lease, within 10 days after written notice (or in case of emergency, without notice), Lessor may, at its option, perform such duty on behalf of Lessee shall, including but not limited to the obtaining of reasonably required bonds, insurance policies, or governmental licenses, permits or approvals. Lessee shall pay Lessor an amount equal to 150% of the expenses incurred by Lessor in such performance upon receipt of an invoice therefor. In the event of a Breach, Lessor may, with or without further notice or demand, and without limiting Lessee's obligations:  
(a) Terminate Lessee's right to possession of the Premises by any lawful means, in which case this Lease shall terminate and Lessee shall immediately surrender possession to Lessor. In such event Lessor shall be entitled to recover from Lessee: (i) the unpaid Rent which had been earned at the time of termination; (ii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent exceeds the amount earned after termination until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rent lost that the Lessor could have been reasonably avoided; (iii) the worth at the time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the term after the time of award exceeds the amount of rent that the Lessee proves could be reasonably avoided; and (iv) any other amount necessary to compensate Lessor for all the detriment proximately caused by the Lessee's failure to perform its obligations under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of things would be likely to result therefrom, including but not limited to the cost of recovering possession of the Premises, expenses of reletting, including necessary renovation and alteration of the Premises, reasonable attorneys' fees, and the cost of any leasing commission paid by Lessor in connection with this Lease applicable to the unexpired term of this Lease. The worth at the time of award of the amount referred to in provision (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of the District within which the Premises are located at the time of award plus one percent. Efforts by Lessor to mitigate damages caused by Lessee's Breach of this Lease shall not waive Lessor's right to recover any damages to which Lessor is otherwise entitled. If termination of this Lease is obtained through the provisional remedy of unlawful detainer, Lessor shall have the right to recover in such proceeding any unpaid Rent and damages as are recoverable therein, or Lessor may reserve the right to recover all or any part thereof in a separate suit. If a notice and grace period required under Paragraph 13.1 was not provided, Lessor may elect to take action or to perform or give to Lessee under the unlawful detainer statute shall also constitute the notice required by Paragraph 13.1. In such case, the applicable grace period required by Paragraph 13.1 and the unlawful detainer shall run concurrently, and the failure of Lessee to cure the breach before the greater of the two such grace periods shall constitute both an unlawful detainer and a Breach of this Lease entitling Lessor to the remedies provided for in this Lease and/or by said statute.  
(b) Continue the Lease and Lessee's right to possession and recover Rent as it becomes due, in which event Lessee may sublet or assign, subject only to reasonable limitations. Acts of maintenance, efforts to relet, and/or the appointment of a receiver to protect the lessor's interests, shall not constitute a termination of the Lessee's right to possession.  
(c) Pursue any other remedy now or hereafter available under the laws or judicial decisions of the state where the Premises are located. The expiration or termination of this Lease and/or the termination of Lessee's right to possession shall not relieve Lessee from liability under any indemnity provisions of this Lease.

(b) If the Responding Party shall fail to execute or deliver the Estoppel Certificate within such 10 days period, the Requesting Party may execute an Estoppel Certificate stating that: (i) the Lease is in full force and effect without modification except as may be represented by the Requesting Party, (ii) there are no uncured defaults in the Requesting Party’s performance, and (iii) if Lessor is the Requesting Party, not more than one month’s rent has been paid in advance. Prospective purchasers and encumbrancers may rely upon the Requesting Party’s Estoppel Certificate, and the Responding Party shall be stopped from denying the truth of the facts contained in said Certificate. In addition, Lessee acknowledges that any failure on its part to provide such an Estoppel Certificate will expose Lessor to risks and potentially cause Lessor to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the extent of which will be extremely difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, should the Lessee fail to execute and/or deliver a requested Estoppel Certificate in a timely fashion the Monthly Base Rent shall be automatically increased, without any requirement for notice to Lessee, by an amount equal to 10% of the then existing Base Rent or $100, whichever is greater for remainder of the Lease. The Parties agree that such increase in Base Rent shall represent additional risk/costs that Lessor will incur by reason of Lessee’s failure to provide the Estoppel Certificate nor prevent the exercise of any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder.

(c) If Lessor desires to finance, refinance, or sell the Premises, or any part thereof, Lessee and all Guarantors shall within 10 days after written notice from Lessor deliver to any potential lender or purchaser designated by Lessor such financial statements as may be reasonably required by such lender or purchaser, including but not limited to Lessee’s financial statements for the past 3 years. All such financial statements shall be received by Lessor and such lender or purchaser in confidence and shall be used only for the purposes herein set forth.

17. Definition of Lessor. The term "Lessor" as used herein shall mean the owner or owners at the time in question of the title to the Premises, or, if this is a sublease, of the Lessee’s interest in the prior lease. In the event of a transfer of Lessor’s title or interest in the Premises of this lease, Lessor shall deliver to the transferee or assignee (in cash or by credit) any unused Security Deposit held by Lessor. Upon such transfer or assignment and delivery of the Security Deposit, as aforesaid, the prior Lessor shall be relieved of all liability with respect to the obligations under this Lease to be performed by the Lessor. Subject to the foregoing, the obligations and/or covenants in this lease to be performed by the Lessor shall hereinafter be defined.

18. Severability. The invalidity of any provision of this Lease, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall in no way affect the validity of any other provision hereof.

19. Limitation on Liability. The obligations of Lessor under this lease shall not extend to personal obligations of Lessor, or its partners, members, directors, officers or shareholders, and Lessee shall look to the Premises, and to no other assets, for the satisfaction of any liability of Lessor to Lessee, and shall not seek recourse against Lessor’s partners, members, directors, officers or any other personal assets for such satisfaction.

21. Time of Performance. Time is of the essence with respect to the performance of obligations to be performed or observed by the parties under this Lease.

22. No Prior or Other Agreements; Broker Disclaimer. This Lease constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to any matter mentioned herein, and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties. No Party shall be liable or bound to any other Party in any manner by any representations, warranties or covenants relating to the subject matter of this Lease, except as expressly set forth herein.

23. Notices.

23.1 Notice Requirements. All notices required or permitted by this Lease or applicable law shall be in writing and may be delivered in person (by hand or by courier) or may be sent by regular, certified or registered mail or U.S. Postal Service Priority Mail, with postage prepaid, or by facsimile transmission, or by email, and shall be deemed delivered by given if served in a manner specified in this Paragraph 23. The addresses noted adjacent to a Party’s signature on this Lease shall be that Party’s address for delivery or mailing of notice. Either Party may by written notice to the other specify a different address, except that upon Lessee’s taking possession of the Premises, the Premises shall constitute Lessee’s address for all notices to Lessee shall be concurrently transmitted to such party or parties at such addresses as Lessor may from time to time hereafter designate in writing.

23.2 Date of Notice. Any notice sent by regular or certified mail, return receipt requested, shall be deemed given on the date of delivery shown on the required card, or if no delivery date is shown, the postmark thereon. If sent by regular mail the notice shall be deemed given 72 hours after there is addressed and required herein and mailed with postage prepaid. Notices delivered by United States Express Mail or overnight courier that guarantees next day delivery shall be deemed delivered 24 hours after delivery of the same to the Postal Service or courier. Notices delivered by hand, or transmitted by facsimile transmission or by email shall be deemed delivered upon actual receipt. If notice is received on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, it shall be deemed received on the next business day.

23.3 Options.

24. Waivers.

(a) No waiver by Lessor of the Default or Breach of any term, covenant or condition hereof by Lessee, shall be deemed a waiver of any other term, covenant or condition hereof, or of any subsequent Default or Breach by Lessee of the same or of any other term, covenant or condition hereof. Lessor’s consent to, or approval of, any act shall not be deemed to render unnecessary the obtaining of Lessor’s consent to, or approval of, any subsequent or similar act by Lessee, or be construed as the basis of an estoppel or reliance of notice or provisions of this Lease requiring such consent.

(b) The acceptance of rent by Lessor shall not be a waiver of any Default or Breach by Lessee. Any payment by Lessee may be accepted by Lessor on account of monies or damages due Lessor, notwithstanding any qualifying statements or conditions made by Lessee in connection therewith, such statements and/or conditions shall be of no force or effect whatsoever unless specifically agreed to in writing by Lessor at or before the time of deposit of such payment.

25. Disclosures Regarding The Nature of A Real Estate Agency Relationships.

(a) When entering into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate transaction, a Lessor should from the outset understand what type of agency relationship or representation it has with the agent or agents in the transaction and Lessee acknowledges being advised by the Brokers in this transaction, as follows:

(i) Lessor’s Agent. A Lessor’s agent under a listing agreement with the Lessor acts as the agent for the Lessor.

In a dual agency situation, the agent has the following affirmative obligations to both the Lessor and the Lessee: (a) A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in the dealings with either Lessor or the Lessee. (b) Other duties to the Lessor and the Lessee as stated above in subparagraphs (i) or (ii). In representing both Lessor and Lessee, the agent may not, without the express permission of the respective Party, disclose to the other Party confidential information, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either Lessee's or Lessor's financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that may impact rent, including Lessee's willingness to accept a rent less than the listing rent or Lessee's willingness to pay rent greater than the rent offered. The above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Lessor or Lessee from the responsibility to protect their own interests. Lessor and Lessee should carefully read all agreements to assure that they adequately express the understanding of the transaction. A real estate agent is person qualified to advise about real estate, if a service is desired, consult a competent professional. Both Lessor and Lessee should strongly consider obtaining tax advice from a competent professional because the federal and state tax consequences of a transaction can be complex and subject to change.

**26. Brokers.** Brokers have no responsibility with respect to any transaction. The Parties agree that no lawsuit or other legal proceeding involving any breach of duty, error or omission relating to this lease may be brought against Broker more than one year after the Date and that liability (including court costs and attorneys' fees), of any Broker with respect to this Lease shall be limited to the fee received by such Broker pursuant to this Lease; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation on Broker's liability shall not be applicable to any gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Broker.

**(c)** Lessor and Lessee agree to identify Brokers as "Confidential" and to maintain any information given by such Party to be confidential.

**27. Cumulative Remedies.** No remedy or election hereunder shall be exclusive but shall, wherever possible, be cumulative with all other remedies at law or in equity.

**28. Covenants and Conditions; Construction of Agreement.** All provisions of this Lease to be observed or performed by Lessee are both covenants and conditions. In construing this Lease, all headings and titles are for the convenience of the Parties only and shall not be considered a part of this Lease. Whenever required by the context, the singular shall include the plural and vice versa. This Lease shall not be construed as if prepared by one of the Parties, but rather according to its meaning as a whole, as both Parties had prepared it.

**29. Binding Effect; Choice of Law.** This Lease shall be binding upon the Parties, their personal representatives, successors and assigns and be governed by the laws of the State in which the Premises are located. Any binding between the Parties before concerning this Lease shall be initiated at the time the Premises are located. Signatures to this Lease accomplished by means of electronic signature or similar technology shall be legal and binding.

**30. Subordination; Attornment; Non-Disturbance.**  
30.1 Subordination. This Lease and any Option granted hereunder shall be subject and subordinate to any ground lease, mortgage, deed of trust, or other hypothecation of security device (collectively, "Security Device"), now or hereafter placed upon the Premises, to any and all advances made on the security thereof, and to all renewals, modifications, and extensions thereof. Lessee agrees that the holders of any such Security Devices (in this Lease referred to as "Lender") shall have no liability or obligation to perform any of the obligations of Lessor under this Lease. Any Lender may elect to have this Lease and/or any Option granted hereby superior to the lien of its Security Device by giving written notice to Lessee, whereupon this Lease and such Options shall be deemed prior to such Security Device, notwithstanding the relative dates of the documentation or recordation thereof.  
30.2 Attornment. In the event that Lessor transfers title to the Premises, or the Premises are acquired by another upon the foreclosure or termination of a Security Device to which this Lease is subordinated (i) Lessee shall, subject to the non-disturbance provisions of Paragraph 30.3, attorn to such new owner, and upon request, enter into a new lease, containing all of the terms and provisions of this Lease, with such new owner for the remainder of the term hereof, or, at the election of the new owner, this Lease shall automatically become a new lease between Lessee and such new owner; and (ii) Lessor shall thereafter be relieved of any further obligations hereunder and such new owner shall assume all of Lessor's obligations, except that such new owner shall not: (a) be liable for any act or omission of any prior lessor or with respect to events occurring prior to acquisition of ownership; (b) be subject to any offsets or defenses which Lessee might have against any prior lessor; (c) be bound by prepayment of more than one month's rent; or (d) be liable for the return of any security deposit paid to any prior lessor which has not been credited to such new owner.  
30.3 Non-Disturbance. With respect to Security Devices entered into by Lessor after the execution of this Lease, Lessee's subordination of this Lease shall be subject to receiving a commercially reasonable non-disturbance agreement ("Non-Disturbance Agreement") from the lender which Non-Disturbance Agreement provides that Lessee's possession of the Premises, and this Lease, including any options to extend the term hereof, will not be disturbed so long as Lessee is not in Breach thereof and attorneys to the record owner of the Premises. Further, within 60 days after the execution of this Lease, Lessor shall, if requested by Lessee, use its

(c) An Option shall terminate and be of no further force or effect, notwithstanding Lessee's due and timely exercise of the Option, if, after such exercise and prior to the commencement of the extended term or completion of the purchase, (i) Lessee fails to pay Rent for a period of 30 days after Rent becomes due (without any necessity of Lessor to give notice thereof), or (ii) if Lessee commits a Breach of this Lease.

40. Multiple Buildings. If the Premises are part of a group of buildings controlled by Lessor, Lessee agrees that it will abide by and conform to all reasonable rules and regulations which Lessor may make from time to time for the management, safety, and care of said properties, including the parking, loading and unloading of vehicles, and to cause its employees, suppliers, shippers, contractors and invitees to so abide and conform. Lessee also agrees to pay its fair share of common expenses incurred in connection with such rules and regulations.

41. Security Measures. Lessee hereby acknowledges that the Rent payable to Lessor hereunder does not include the cost of guard service or other security measures, and that Lessor shall have no obligation whatsoever to provide same. Lessee assumes all responsibility for the protection of the Premises, Lessee, its agents and invitees and their property from the acts of third parties.

42. Reservations. Lessor reserves to itself the right, from time to time, to grant, without the consent or joinder of Lessee, such easements, rights and restrictions that Lessor deems necessary, and to cause the recordation of parcel maps and restrictions, so long as such easements, rights, dedications, maps and restrictions do not unreasonably interfere with the use of the Premises by Lessee. Lessee agrees to sign any documents reasonably requested by Lessor to effectuate any such easement rights, dedication, map or restrictions.

43. Performance Under Protest. If at any time a dispute shall arise as to any amount or sum of money to be paid by one Party to the other under the provisions hereof, the Party against whom the obligation to pay the money is asserted shall have the right to make payment "under protest" and such payment shall not be regarded as a voluntary payment and there shall survive the right on the part of said Party to institute suit for recovery of such sum. If it shall be adjudged that there was no legal obligation on the part of said Party to pay such sum or any part thereof, said Party shall be entitled to recover such sum or so much thereof as it was not legally required to pay. A Party who does not initiate suit for the recovery of such sum "under protest" within 6 months shall be deemed to have waived its right to protest such payment.

44. Authority; Multiple Parties; Execution.

It is agreed that any one of the named Lessees shall be empowered to execute any amendment to this Lease, or other document ancillary thereto and bind all of the named Lessees, regardless of whether the same is all of the named Lessees and shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

45. Conflict. Any inconsistency between the printed provisions of this Lease and any handwritten provisions shall be governed by the typewritten provisions.

46. Offer. Preparation of this Lease by either Party or by anyone on behalf of either Party shall not be deemed to be an offer or lease to the other Party. This Lease is intended to be binding until executed and delivered by all Parties hereto.

47. Amendments. This Lease may be modified only in writing, signed by the Parties in interest at the time of the modification. As long as the party to change Lessor's obligations hereunder, Lessee agrees to make such reasonable non-material modifications to this Lease as may be reasonably required by a lender in connection with the obtaining of normal financing or refinancing of the Premises.

48. Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING INVOLVING THE PROPERTY OR ARISING OUT OF THIS LEASE.

7. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.**

3 | Page
<!-- Page 83 -->
b. **Limitation of Advisor Liability.** Except to the extent finally determined to have resulted from the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of Advisor, Advisor's liability to pay damages for any damages, losses and claims incurred by District, regardless of the theory of liability asserted, is limited to no more than an amount equal to the total amount of fees paid to Advisor under this Agreement.

d. **Limitation of District Liability.** Except to the extent finally determined to have resulted from the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of District, District's liability to pay damages for any damages, losses and claims incurred by Advisor, regardless of the theory of liability asserted, is limited to no more than an amount equal to the total amount of fees to be paid to Advisor under this Agreement.

e. **Survival of Liability.** The provisions of this Section 6 shall survive the expiration or termination of this agreement.

8. **PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY INSURANCE**

Advisors will procure and maintain Professional liability insurance with the minimum limits of $1,000,000 per occurrence.

In addition, the "retro" date must be on or before the date of this Agreement.

Advisors will furnish to District duly authenticated Certificates of Insurance and Endorsements evidencing maintenance of the insurance required under this Agreement and such other evidence of insurance as may be reasonably required by District from time to time. Insurance must be placed with insurers with a current A.M. Best Company Rating equivalent "A VII." Originals of the duly authenticated Certificates of Insurance and Endorsements shall be included with this Agreement.

Each insurance policy shall state or be endorsed to state that coverage shall not be canceled by either party, except after thirty (30) days (10 days for non-payment of premium) prior written notice by U.S. mail has been given to the District.

4 | Page
<!-- Page 84 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
any actual or potential cancellation, shall constitute a breach of contract for which District shall be entitled to full indemnification under the Agreement.

Maintenance of specified insurance coverage is a material element of this Agreement, and Advisors' failure to maintain or renew coverage or to provide evidence of renewal during the term of this Agreement may be treated as a material breach of contract by District.

9. CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION. It is mutually agreed that Advisor shall regard all information received during the performance of services pursuant to this Agreement ("Confidential Information") as confidential and shall not disclose Confidential Information to any other person without prior consent of District. Confidential Information shall not include information that: (i) is, as of the time of its disclosure, or thereafter becomes, part of the public domain through a source other than Advisor; (ii) was known to Advisor as of the time of its disclosure; (iii) is independently developed by Advisor; or (iv) is subsequently learned from a third party not under a confidentiality obligation to District. In addition, Advisor shall be entitled to disclose Confidential Information to the extent such disclosure is requested by the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, administrative agency, or other governmental body, provided that Advisor shall provide prompt, advance notice thereof to enable District to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent such disclosure. The confidentiality obligations of Advisor shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

10. ADDITIONAL MATTERS.

a. MSRB Rule G-10  
Pursuant to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rule G-10, on Investor and Municipal Advisory Client Education and Protection, Municipal Advisors are required to provide certain written information to their municipal entity and obligated person clients, which include the following:  
• Urban Futures, Inc. is currently registered as a Municipal Advisor with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.  
• Within the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB") website at www.msrb.org, The District may obtain the Municipal Advisory client brochure that is posted on the MSRB website. The brochure describes the protections that may be provided by the MSRB Rules, along with how to file a complaint with financial regulatory authorities.

b. MSRB Rule G-42.  
Pursuant to Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board ("MSRB") Rule G-42, on Duties of Non-Solicitor Municipal Advisors, Municipal Advisors are required to make certain written disclosures to clients, which include, amongst other things, Conflicts of Interest and any Legal or Disciplinary events of the Advisor and its associated persons.  
5 | Page
<!-- Page 85 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

As of the date of the Agreement, there are no actual or potential material conflicts of interest that the Advisor is aware of that might impair its ability to render unbiased and competent advice or to fulfill its fiduciary duty. If the Advisor becomes aware of any material potential conflict of interest that arise after this disclosure, the Advisor will disclose the detailed information in writing to the District in a timely manner.

The following are potential conflicts of interest to be considered.

i. Conflicts of Interest. The Advisor represents that in connection with the issuance of municipal securities, Advisor may receive compensation from an Issuer or Obligated Person for services rendered, which compensation is contingent upon the successful closing of a transaction and/or is based on the size of a transaction. Consistent with the requirements of MSRB Rule G-42, the Advisor hereby discloses that such contingent and/or transactional compensation may present a potential conflict of interest regarding the Advisors' ability to provide unbiased advice to enter into such transaction. The contingent fee arrangement creates an incentive for the Advisor to recommend unnecessary financings or financings that are disadvantageous to the District, or to advise the District to increase the size of the issue. This potential conflict of interest will not impair the Advisor's ability to render unbiased and competent advice or to fulfill its fiduciary duty to the Advisor.

(1) It should be noted that the Advisor’s fees under this agreement may be based on hourly fees of the Advisor’s personnel, with the aggregate amount equaling the number of hours worked by such personnel times an agreed-upon hourly billing rate. This form of compensation presents a potential conflict of interest because it could create an incentive for the Advisors to recommend alternatives that would result in more hours worked. This conflict of interest will not impair the Advisor's ability to render unbiased and competent advice or to fulfill its fiduciary duty to the Advisor.

(2) The Advisor’s fees under this agreement may be a fixed amount established at the outset of the Agreement. The amount is usually based upon an analysis by District and the Advisor of, among other things, the expected duration and complexity of the transaction and the Scope of Services to be performed by Municipal Advisor. This form of compensation presents a potential conflict of interest because, if the transaction requires more work than originally contemplated, the Advisor may suffer a loss. Thus, the Advisor may recommend less time-consuming alternatives or fail to do a thorough analysis of alternatives. This conflict of interest will not impair the Advisor's ability to render unbiased and competent advice or to fulfill its fiduciary duty to the District.

(3) The fee paid to the Advisor increases the cost of investment to the District. The increased cost occurs from compensating the Advisor for municipal advisory services provided.

(4) The Advisor serves a wide variety of other clients that may from time to time have interests that could have a direct or indirect impact on the interests of another of the Advisor's clients. For example, the Advisor serves as municipal advisor to other  
6 | Page
<!-- Page 86 -->
municipal advisory clients and, in such cases, owes a regulatory duty to such other clients just as it does to the District. These other clients may, from time to time and depending on the specific circumstances, have competing interests.

![San Juan Unified School District Board of Education Agenda Item](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=San+Juan+Unified+School+District+Board+of+Education+Agenda+Item)

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT**  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**AGENDA ITEM:** K-1  
**MEETING DATE:** 12/12/2023  

**SUBJECT:** Amending District Graduation Requirements for the Class of 2024  
**DEPARTMENT:** Division of Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board hear and discuss the recommendation for the district’s graduation requirements for the Class of 2024 due to the disruption in education caused by COVID-19. This recommendation is for the 2023-2024 school year.  

Action anticipated: January 9, 2024.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
In 2016 the board approved to increase graduation requirements starting with the Class of 2023. The increased graduation requirements project included a plan to communicate the new requirements to family, students, and the community as well as a plan to support students with a tiered approach to meeting the increased requirements. These increased requirements included additional courses in mathematics, science, and world language; however, with school closures occurring due to COVID-19, the disruption to students’ education has impacted many of our current seniors. In order to mitigate these hardships, California built in support for the classes of 2021 and 2022 by adopting Assembly Bill 104 (AB 104) which reverted to the state minimum graduation requirement of 130 credits. Additionally, the board approved amended graduation requirements for the class of 2023.  

In order to support the class of 2024 in meeting San Juan Unified’s graduation requirements, staff reviewed current data for seniors, gathered input from staff, students, and the community, and determined there was a need to reduce the number of credits needed to graduate. The recommended graduation requirement is 160 credits.

# Offering Relief for Credit Deficient Students:  
## District Graduation Requirements for the Class of 2024  
### San Juan Unified School District  
### Board of Education  
### December 12, 2023  

---

## The Goal:  
- The class of 2024 spent their 9th grade year in distance learning, which impacted many students.  
- In reviewing transcripts and student credit data, many students needed to repeat courses in math and science in order to meet increased requirements.  
- San Juan Unified’s College and Career Ready (CCR) graduation requirements began with the class of 2023. After offering relief last year and reviewing data on the progress of the 2024 class, the goal is to provide options for relief and to keep students with a plan to graduate.

# San Juan Unified School District  
## 2023-24 First Interim  
### Introduction  

## OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTION  

### FINANCIAL OVERVIEW  
The San Juan Unified School District financial status is comprised of three major components: (1) Fund Balance (Ending and Beginning Balance); (2) Revenues; and (3) Expenditures. Estimates in the First Interim Report are based on actual activity through October 31, 2023. The district certifies this report as **Positive**. The Second Interim Report will be presented in March 2024.  

### DISTRICT MISSION  
We empower all in our inclusive learning community to contribute and thrive in a radically evolving world.  

### SHARED VALUES  
We value:  

- **Inclusivity**  
  We commit to cultivating an inclusive community of belonging with genuine respect for diverse cultures, identities and abilities.  

- **Real World Knowledge**  
  We commit to creating environments and providing experiences that build and apply relevant skills and knowledge for the real world.  

- **Voice**  
  We commit to hearing all voices, acknowledging, validating, and responding as we continuously grow together as a community.  

- **Social and Emotional Intelligence**  
  We commit to creating a culture that embraces, teaches, models and applies social and emotional intelligence in all interactions with all stakeholders.  

- **Perseverance**  
  We commit to creating a learning atmosphere that models and instills perseverance through adversity and encourages risk taking.  
<!-- Page 109 -->
# CORE COMMITMENTS
- Prioritize resources to close opportunity gaps, improve teaching and learning, recruit and retain high quality employees and help all students reach their potential.
- Provide sound fiscal stewardship of community resources.
- Build trust by sharing useful, transparent fiscal information.
- Adopt a budget that consistently balances on-going revenues and expenditures to avoid a structural deficit.
- Preserve an ending fund balance that ensures integrity and stability of the district.

# CORE MESSAGES
- The state faces potential revenue shortfalls and budget deficits that could result in further cuts to education spending. The state’s total revenue for the last fiscal year will not be known until all outstanding 2022 taxes have been filed, because nearly all residents and some corporations were granted tax filing extensions until November.
- The Legislative Analyst's Office recently indicated that the state may be experiencing a mild recession that began in the fourth quarter of 2022. While state revenues appear to be stabilizing, the office projects that the state will face a nearly $10 billion deficit in 2024-25.
- To compound matters, the 2024-25 COLA is showing a downward trend towards 2%. This projection is based on five out of the eight data points used to calculate the statutory COLA.
- LEAs face near and long-term challenges, including risks to the state revenue forecast, reduced ADA because of COVID-19-related student absences, cost pressures (e.g., pension rate increases), expiring one-time COVID-19 relief funds, and declining enrollment.
- The district will continue to exercise caution and flexibility in long-term fiscal planning. The budget will support on-going expenditures with on-going revenues and meet the requirements of a positive certification.

# SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION (SCOE)
The Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) reviews all district budgets and interim budget reports. SCOE has an oversight obligation to monitor the district’s long-term fiscal health as prescribed in AB 1200. SCOE has provided the following guidance:
- The level of LCFF funding is subject to economic conditions as well as political decisions by the governor and legislature.
- Re-evaluate spending priorities to address student achievement and begin new initiatives only if long-term solvency can be maintained (avoid cycles of additions and reductions).
- Exercise caution and maintain flexibility in collective bargaining process. Neighboring districts have widely divergent levels of funding. Consider increases to pension rates, rising health care costs, and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
- Maintain reserves much greater than the minimum requirement.
- Support on-going expenditures with on-going revenues.

# 2023-25 MULTI-YEAR PROJECTIONS

The district primarily uses estimates from the Department of Finance (DOF) to project LCFF revenue growth in 2023-24 through 2025-26. The district Operations Department provides enrollment estimates, which are used to calculate Average Daily Attendance (ADA), the basis of state funding. Operating costs for future years are projected using historical patterns, statistical probabilities, and projected cost of living adjustments (COLA’s). Significant expenditure assumptions include salaries, seniority and retirement of employees, healthcare and other benefit costs, public pension plans (STRS and PERS), utilities, property, and liability insurance, etc.

## PLANNING FACTORS

# 6C. Comparison of District Total Operating Revenues and Expenditures to the Standard Percentage Range

**DATA ENTRY:** Explanations are linked from Section 6A if the status in Section 6B is Not Met; no entry is allowed below.

1a. **STANDARD NOT MET** - One or more projected operating revenues have changed since budget adoption by more than the standard in one or more of the current year or two subsequent fiscal years. Reasons for the projected change, descriptions of the methods and assumptions used in the projections, and what changes, if any, will be made to bring the projected operating revenues within the standard must be entered in Section 6A above and will also display in the explanation box below.

**Explanation:**
- Federal Rev Enue (linked from 6A)  
  There will be COVID related resources carried into the beginning of 24-25.

**Explanation:**
- Other State Revenue (linked from 6A)  
  The new tx fine funds had a revised award after the adopted budget was posted.

**Explanation:**
- Other Local Revenue (linked from 6A)  
  Increases due to Interest Income, Charter School oversight fees and STRS excess in 23-24. The two out years are budgeted for decreases in interest and STRS excess.

1b. **STANDARD NOT MET** - One or more total operating expenditures have changed since budget adoption by more than the standard in one or more of the current year or two subsequent fiscal years. Reasons for the projected change, descriptions of the methods and assumptions used in the projections, and what changes, if any, will be made to bring the projected operating revenues within the standard must be entered in Section 6A above and will also display in the explanation box below.

**Explanation:**
- Books and Supplies (linked from 6A)  
  Books and Supplies increase in 23-24 due to budgeting for carryover, aligning budgets to current year spending plans, textbook projections changes due to framework delays and resultant extra year textbook costs. Extinguishing carryover and textbook projections caused the net decrease in 24-25; the net increase in 25-26 is primarily due to textbook pilot schedule changes because of CDE framework delays.

**Explanation:**
- Services and Other Expenditures (linked from 6A)  
  The net increase in 23-24 is due to budgeting for carryover and aligning budgets to current year spending plans, one-time grants for arts & music for 23-24 only, an increase in payments to residency grant participants, and an increase in services within RRMA. In 24-25, the increase is due to the spending of the Learning Recovery grant.

### ACTION REQUESTED:  
The superintendent is recommending that the board hear a report regarding the delay in the completion of the 2022-2023 Audit Report.  

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:  
The statutory due date to file the annual audit is December 15. The district has filed a request for an extension to submit the 2022-2023 audit to the California Department of Education (CDE). The purpose of this extension is to await the approval of the J-13A waiver that was filed with the CDE and to alleviate the forthcoming adjustments pending the CDE’s review and expected approval for the J-13A waiver.  

The J-13A form is a “Request for allowance of attendance due to emergency conditions”. This form (waiver) was filed for Barrett Middle School and Grand Oaks Elementary for the 2022-23 school year. On January 4, 2023, Governor Newsom proclaimed a statewide state of emergency to exist due to multiple storms with heavy rain and high winds. On January 7, 8 and 9, Sacramento was hit with storm systems that caused widespread damage and power outages to hundreds of residents and businesses. Power remained out at Grand Oaks Elementary until the evening of Tuesday, January 10, while service was not restored at Barrett Middle School until the mid-morning of Wednesday, January 11, necessitating the closure of both schools for safety. The district has been informed that the CDE is behind on their approvals of J-13As. Two weeks ago, the CDE reported that there were approximately 640 pending approvals for FY 2023. Both the CDE and the State Controller’s office (SCO) shared that they expect the Schedule of Instructional Time in the audit report should exclude any days and/or minutes that are pending Form J-13A approval. This would result in San Juan Unified being out of compliance with the 180 instructional day and minutes requirements for some grade spans.  

In light of this situation, the SCO has recommended that districts with pending J-13A approvals request an extension of 90 days to file their 2022-23 financial statement audit. This extension would allow sufficient time for processing of all waiver applications. The district has the option to file the audit report without the J-13A approval; however, this would require an audit adjustment to accrue for the fiscal penalty, and the auditors would be required to qualify the audit opinion for State compliance. Once the waiver is approved, the audit report would need to be resubmitted to eliminate the qualification and penalty. It is worth noting that many districts in Sacramento and surrounding counties are currently filing for this extension; thus, the impact is significant. It is anticipated that the J-13A approval may be granted between December and March, at which time the district’s independent auditor, Crowe LLP, would proceed with the preparation of the audit report and the item would be brought to the board for action.

ARTICLE II

THE SERIES 2024 BONDS

SECTION 2.01. Authorization. The Board hereby authorizes the issuance of the Series 2024 Bonds in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $125,000,000 under and subject to the terms of Article XIII A, Section 1 paragraph (b) of the California Constitution, the Bond Law and this Resolution, for the purpose of raising funds for the acquisition or improvement of educational facilities in accordance with the Bond Measure, and to pay Costs of Issuance. This Resolution constitutes a continuing agreement between the District and the owners of all the Series 2024 Bonds issued or to be issued hereunder and Outstanding to secure the full and final payment of principal thereof and interest and premium, if any, on all Series 2024 Bonds, subject to the covenants agreements, provisions and conditions herein contained. The Series 2024 Bonds will be issued as current interest bonds and shall be designated the “San Juan Unified School District General Obligation Bonds, Election of 2016, Series 2024” with such additional designations as may be made in the Bond Purchase Agreement.

SECTION 2.02. Terms of Series 2024 Bonds.

(a) Terms of Series 2024 Bonds. The Series 2024 Bonds will be issued as fully registered bonds, without coupons, in the denomination of $5,000 each or any integral multiple thereof, but in an amount not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of Series 2024 Bonds maturing in the year of maturity of the Series 2024 Bonds for which the denomination is specified. Series 2024 Bonds will be lettered and numbered as the Paying Agent may prescribe. The Series 2024 Bonds will be dated as of the Closing Date.

Interest on the Series 2024 Bonds is payable semi-annually on each Interest Payment Date. Each Series 2024 Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of registration and authentication thereof unless (i) it is authenticated as of an Interest Payment Date, in which event it will bear interest from such date, or (ii) it is authenticated prior to an Interest Payment Date and after the close of business on the Record Date preceding such Interest Payment Date, in which event it will bear interest from such Interest Payment Date, or (iii) it is authenticated prior to the first Record Date, in which event it will bear interest from the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if interest on any Series 2024 Bond is in default at the time of authentication thereof, such Series 2024 Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date to which interest has previously been paid or made available for payment thereon.
<!-- Page 284 -->
(b) Maturities; Basis of Interest Calculation. The Series 2024 Bonds will mature on August 1 (unless otherwise provided in the Bond Purchase Agreement) in the years and in the amounts, and will bear interest at the rates, as determined upon the sale thereof as provided in the Bond Purchase Agreement; provided, however, the maximum interest rate per annum and the final maturity date shall not extend beyond the legal limits set forth in the Bond Law. Interest on the Series 2024 Bonds will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The final maturity of the Series 2024 Bonds shall not exceed the legal limit identified in the Bond Law, and if the final maturity is more than 30 years after the Closing Date, a District Representative is authorized to execute a certification confirming that the useful life of the facilities to be financed with the proceeds of the Series 2024 Bonds which mature more than 30 years after the Closing Date exceeds the final maturity date of said Series 2024 Bonds.

(c) CUSIP Identification Numbers. CUSIP identification numbers will be imprinted on the Series 2024 Bonds, but such numbers do not constitute a part of the contract evidenced by the Series 2024 Bonds and any error or omission with respect thereto will not constitute cause for refusal of any purchaser to accept delivery of and pay for the Series 2024 Bonds. In addition, failure on the part of the District to use such CUSIP numbers in any notice to Owners of the Series 2024 Bonds will not constitute an event of default or any violation of the District’s contract with such Owners and will not impair the effectiveness of any such notice.

(d) Payment. Interest on the Series 2024 Bonds (including the final interest payment upon maturity or redemption) is payable by check, draft or wire of the Paying Agent mailed to the Owner thereof (which will be DTC so long as the Series 2024 Bonds are held in the book-entry system of DTC) at such Owner’s address as it appears on the Registration Books at the close of business on the preceding Record Date; except that at the written request of the Owner of at least $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Series 2024 Bonds, which written request is on file with the Paying Agent as of any Record Date, interest on such Series 2024 Bonds will be paid on the succeeding Interest Payment Date to such account as will be specified in such written request. Principal and premium (if any) on the Series 2024 Bonds is payable in lawful money of the United States of America upon presentation and surrender at the Office of the Paying Agent.

(e) Issuance in More Than One Series; Federally Taxable Basis. Each District Representative is hereby authorized to designate that the Series 2024 Bonds may be issued in one or more series, and that a portion of the Series 2024 Bonds may be issued on a federally taxable basis.

(f) Provisions of Bond Purchase Agreement to Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section and the following provisions of Section 2.03, but subject to the provisions of Section 3.01 hereof, any of the terms of the Series 2024 Bonds may be established or modified under the Bond Purchase Agreement. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this Resolution and the Bond Purchase Agreement relating to the terms of the Series 2024 Bonds, the provisions of the Bond Purchase Agreement will be controlling.

SECTION 2.03. Redemption of Series 2024 Bonds.

(a) Optional Redemption Dates and Prices. The Series 2024 Bonds are subject to redemption prior to maturity, at the option of the District, in whole or in part among maturities on such basis as designated by the District and by lot within a maturity, from any available source of funds, on the dates and at the respective redemption prices as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement.

(b) Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If the Bond Purchase Agreement specifies that any one or more maturities of the Series 2024 Bonds are term bonds which are subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption, each such maturity of Series 2024 Bonds shall be subject to such mandatory sinking fund redemption on August 1 (unless otherwise provided in the Bond Purchase Agreement) in each of the years and in the respective principal amounts as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed (without premium), together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. If any such term bonds are redeemed under the provisions of the preceding clause (a), the total amount of all future payments under this subsection (b) with respect to such term bonds shall be reduced by the aggregate principal amount of such term bonds so redeemed, to be allocated among such payments on a pro rata basis in integral multiples of $5,000 (or on such other basis as the District may determine) as set forth in written notice given by the District to the Paying Agent.

(c) Selection of Series 2024 Bonds for Redemption. Whenever less than all of the Outstanding Series 2024 Bonds of any one maturity are designated for redemption, the Paying Agent shall select the Outstanding Series 2024 Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed by lot in any manner deemed fair by the Paying Agent. For purposes of such selection, each Series 2024 Bond will be deemed to consist of individual bonds of $5,000 principal amount. The Series 2024 Bonds may all be separately redeemed.

(d) Redemption Procedure. The Paying Agent shall cause notice of any redemption to be mailed, first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 20 days but not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, to the respective Owners of any Series 2024 Bonds designated for redemption, at their addresses appearing on the Registration Books. Such notice may be a conditional notice of redemption and subject to rescission as set forth in (e) below. Such mailing is not a condition precedent to such redemption and the failure to mail or to receive any such notice will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of such Series 2024 Bonds. In addition, the Paying Agent will give notice of redemption by telecopy or certified, registered or overnight mail to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and each of the Securities Depositories at least two days prior to such mailing to the Series 2024 Bond Owners.

Such notice shall state the redemption date and the redemption price and, if less than all of the then Outstanding Series 2024 Bonds are to be called for redemption, shall designate the serial numbers of the Series 2024 Bonds to be redeemed by giving the individual number of each Series 2024 Bond or by indicating those Series 2024 Bonds between two stated numbers, both inclusive, or by stating that all of the Series 2024 Bonds of one or more maturities have been called for redemption, and shall require that such Series 2024 Bonds be then surrendered at the Office of the Paying Agent for redemption at the said redemption price, giving notice also that further interest on such Series 2024 Bonds will not accrue from and after the redemption date.

-8-
<!-- Page 286 -->
Upon surrender of Series 2024 Bonds redeemed in part only, the District shall execute and the Paying Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the Owner, at the expense of the District, a new Series 2024 Bond or Bonds, of the same maturity, of authorized denominations in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Series 2024 Bond or Bonds.

From and after the date fixed for redemption, if notice of such redemption has been duly given and funds available for the payment of the principal of and interest (and premium, if any) on the Series 2024 Bonds so called for redemption have been duly provided, the Series 2024 Bonds called for redemption will cease to be entitled to any benefit under this Resolution other than the right to receive payment of the redemption price, and no interest will accrue thereon on or after the redemption date specified in the notice. The Paying Agent will cancel all Series 2024 Bonds redeemed under this Section and will furnish a certificate of cancellation to the District.

(e) Right to Rescind Notice of Redemption. The District has the right to rescind any notice of the optional redemption of Series 2024 Bonds under subsection (a) of this Section by written notice to the Paying Agent on or prior to the dated fixed for redemption. Any notice of redemption shall be cancelled and annulled if for any reason funds will not be or are not available on the date fixed for redemption for the payment in full of the Series 2024 Bonds then called for redemption. The District and the Paying Agent shall have no liability to the Series 2024 Bond Owners or any other party related to or arising from such rescission of redemption. The Paying Agent shall mail notice of such rescission of redemption in the same manner as the original notice of redemption was sent under subsection (d) of this Section.

SECTION 2.04. Form of Series 2024 Bonds. The Series 2024 Bonds, the form of the Paying Agent’s certificate of authentication and registration and the form of assignment to appear thereon will be substantially in the forms, respectively, as are set forth in Appendix A attached hereto, with necessary or appropriate variations, omissions and insertions, as permitted or required by this Resolution and the Bond Purchase Agreement.

SECTION 2.05. Execution of Series 2024 Bonds. The Series 2024 Bonds shall be signed by the facsimile signature of the President, Vice President or Clerk of the Board and shall be attested by the facsimile signature of a District Representative. Only those Series 2024 Bonds bearing a certificate of authentication and registration in the form set forth in Appendix A attached hereto, executed and dated by the Paying Agent, shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose or entitled to the benefits of this Resolution, and such certificate of the Paying Agent is conclusive evidence that the Series 2024 Bonds so registered have been duly authenticated, registered and delivered hereunder and are entitled to the benefits of this Resolution.

SECTION 2.06. Transfer of Series 2024 Bonds. Subject to Section 2.10, any Series 2024 Bond may, in accordance with its terms, be transferred upon the Registration Books by the person in whose name it is registered, in person or by his duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of such Series 2024 Bond for cancellation at the Office of the Paying Agent, accompanied by delivery of a written instrument of transfer in a form approved by the Paying Agent, duly executed. The District may charge a reasonable sum for each new Series 2024 Bond issued upon any transfer.
<!-- Page 287 -->
Whenever any Series 2024 Bond or Bonds is surrendered for transfer, the District shall execute and the Paying Agent shall authenticate and deliver a new Series 2024 Bond or Bonds, for like aggregate principal amount. No transfers of Series 2024 Bonds shall be required to be made (a) 15 days prior to the date established by the Paying Agent for selection of Series 2024 Bonds for redemption or (b) with respect to a Series 2024 Bond which has been selected for redemption.

Series 2024 Bonds may be exchanged at the principal Office of the Paying Agent for a like aggregate principal amount of Series 2024 Bonds of authorized denominations and of the same maturity. The District may charge a reasonable sum for each new Series 2024 Bond issued upon any exchange (except in the cases of any exchange of temporary Series 2024 Bonds for definitive Series 2024 Bonds). No exchanges of Series 2024 Bonds shall be required to be made (a) during the period commencing 15 days before the date established by the Paying Agent for selection of Series 2024 Bonds for redemption, or (b) with respect to a Series 2024 Bond after such Series 2024 Bond has been selected for redemption.

SECTION 2.08. Registration Books. The Paying Agent shall keep or cause to be kept sufficient books for the registration and transfer of the Series 2024 Bonds, which shall at all times be open to inspection by the District upon reasonable notice; and, upon presentation for such purpose, the Paying Agent shall, under such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, register or transfer or cause to be registered or transferred, on said books, Series 2024 Bonds as herein before provided.

SECTION 2.09. Book-Entry System. Except as provided below, DTC shall be the Owner of all of the Series 2024 Bonds, and the Series 2024 Bonds shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee for DTC. The Series 2024 Bonds shall be initially executed and delivered in the form of a single fully registered Series 2024 Bond for each maturity date of the Series 2024 Bonds in the full aggregate principal amount of the Series 2024 Bonds maturing on such date. The Paying Agent and the District may treat DTC (or its nominee) as the sole and exclusive owner of the Series 2024 Bonds registered in its name for all purposes of this Resolution, and neither the Paying Agent nor the District shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. The Paying Agent and the District have no responsibility or obligation to any Depository System Participant, any person claiming a beneficial ownership interest in the Series 2024 Bonds under or through DTC or a Depository System Participant, or any other person which is not shown on the register of the District as being an owner, with respect to the accuracy of any records maintained by DTC or any Depository System Participant or the payment by DTC or any Depository System Participant of any amount in respect of the principal or interest with respect to the Series 2024 Bonds. The District shall cause to be paid all principal and interest with respect to the Series 2024 Bonds only to DTC, and all such payments shall be valid and effective to fully satisfy and discharge the District’s obligations with respect to the principal and interest with respect to the Series 2024 Bonds to the extent of the sum or sums so paid. Except under the conditions noted below, no person other than DTC shall receive a Series 2024 Bond. Upon delivery by DTC to the District of written notice to the effect that DTC has determined to substitute a new nominee in place of Cede & Co., the term “Cede & Co.” in this Resolution shall refer to such new nominee of DTC.

If the District determines that it is in the best interest of the beneficial owners that they be able to obtain Series 2024 Bonds and delivers a written certificate to DTC and the

-10-
<!-- Page 288 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

District to that effect, DTC shall notify participants in its book-entry system (the “DTC Participants”) of the availability through DTC of Series 2024 Bonds. In such event, the District shall issue, transfer and exchange Series 2024 Bonds as requested by DTC and any other owners in appropriate amounts.

DTC may determine to discontinue providing its services with respect to the Series 2024 Bonds at any time by giving notice to the District and discharging its responsibilities with respect thereto under applicable law. Under such circumstances (if there is no successor securities depository), the District shall be obligated to deliver Series 2024 Bonds as described in this Resolution. Whenever DTC requests the District to do so, the District will cooperate with DTC in taking appropriate action after reasonable notice to (a) make available one or more separate Series 2024 Bonds evidencing the Series 2024 Bonds to any Depository System Participant having Series 2024 Bonds credited to its DTC account or (b) arrange for another securities depository to maintain custody of certificates evidencing the Series 2024 Bonds.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Resolution to the contrary, so long as any Series 2024 Bond is registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, all payments with respect to the principal and interest with respect to such Series 2024 Bond and all notices with respect to such Series 2024 Bond shall be made and given, respectively, to DTC as provided as in the representation letter delivered on the date of issuance of the Series 2024 Bonds.

Section 2.10. Transfer Under Book-Entry System: Discontinuation of Book-Entry System. Registered ownership of the Series 2024 Bonds, or any portion thereof, may not be transferred except as follows:

(i) To any successor of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC, or its nominee, or to any substitute depository designated pursuant to clause (ii) of this section (a “substitute depository”); provided that any successor of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC or substitute depository, shall be qualified under any applicable laws to provide the services proposed to be provided by it;

(ii) To any substitute depository not objected to by the District or the County, upon (1) the resignation of DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository, or (2) a determination by the County (upon consultation with the District) to substitute another depository for DTC (or its successor) because DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) is no longer able to carry out its functions as depository; provided, that any such substitute depository shall be qualified under any applicable laws to provide the services proposed to be provided by it; or

(iii) To any person upon (1) the resignation of DTC or its successor (or substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository, or (2) a determination by the District to remove DTC or its successor (or any substitute depository or its successor) from its functions as depository.

## SALE OF SERIES 2024 BONDS; APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS

### SECTION 3.01. Sale of Series 2024 Bonds; Approval of Sale Documents.

(a) **Negotiated Sale of Series 2024 Bonds.** Pursuant to Section 53508.7 of the Bond Law, the Board hereby authorizes the negotiated sale of the Series 2024 Bonds to the Underwriter. The Series 2024 Bonds shall be sold pursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement in substantially the form on file with the Clerk of the Board with such changes therein, deletions therefrom and modifications thereto as a District Representative may approve, such approval to be conclusively evidenced by the execution and delivery by a District Representative of the Bond Purchase Agreement, provided that the Bond Purchase Agreement shall contain the following terms:

(i) the Series 2024 Bonds shall bear a rate of interest of not to exceed 6% per annum and the final maturity shall not exceed the limits contained in the Bond Law;

The Board hereby authorizes a District Representative to execute and deliver the final form of the Bond Purchase Agreement in the name and on behalf of the District.

In accordance with Section 53508.7 of the Bond Law, the Board has determined to sell the Series 2024 Bonds at negotiated sale for the following reasons: (a) a negotiated sale provides more flexibility to choose the time and date of the sale which is often advantageous in the municipal bond market; (b) the involvement of the Underwriter in preparing documents, rating agency presentations and structuring bonds generally enhances the quality and results of the bond offering; (c) a negotiated sale will permit the time schedule for the issuance and sale of the Series 2024 Bonds to be expedited, if necessary; (d) a negotiated sale provides the District access to the underwriter’s trading desk for providing estimates of the cost of various bond structures (yields, discounts, premiums and maturities) for the purpose of evaluating alternative potential bond structures with the goal of producing the best match between District objectives and investor acceptance and demand; and (e) a negotiated sale provides time for underwriters to educate potential investors about the District and the Series 2024 Bonds with the goal of maximizing investor orders and reducing interest cost on the day of bond pricing.

As required pursuant to Section 53509.5 of the Bond Law, after the sale of the Series 2024 Bonds, the Board will present actual cost information of the sale at its next scheduled public meeting.

A District Representative is hereby authorized and directed to approve any changes in or additions to a final form of said Official Statement, and the execution thereof by a District Representative shall be conclusive evidence of his or her approval of any such changes and additions. The Board hereby authorizes the distribution of the Official Statement by the Underwriter. The final Official Statement shall be executed in the name and on behalf of the District by a District Representative.

(c) Actions to Close Bond Issuance. Each District Representative and any and all other officers of the District are each authorized and directed in the name and on behalf of the District to execute and deliver any and all certificates, requisitions, agreements, notices, consents, warrants and other documents, which they or any of them might deem necessary or appropriate in order to consummate the lawful issuance, sale and delivery of the Series 2024 Bonds, including but not limited to the execution and delivery of a document with respect to the engagement of the Paying Agent appointed hereby, and an agreement facilitating the payment of Costs of Issuance.

A District Representative is authorized to enter into an agreement with such fiscal agent to facilitate such payment. In addition, the Bond Purchase Agreement may provide that the Underwriter is obligated to pay certain Costs of Issuance and a District Representative is authorized to review and consent to a schedule of such costs.

SECTION 3.03. Building Fund. The Director of Finance shall maintain a fund designated as the “San Juan Unified School District, Election of 2016, Series 2024 Building Fund,” into which the proceeds from the sale of the Series 2024 Bonds shall be deposited, to the extent required under Section 3.02(b).

Additionally, the County is directed to include in the tax levy the expense of paying the Series 2024 Bonds elsewhere than at the office of the Director of Finance.

The principal of and interest and redemption premium (if any) on Series 2024 Bonds do not constitute a debt of the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions other than the District, or any of the officers, agents or employees thereof. Neither the County, the State of California, any of its political subdivisions nor any of the

officers, agents or employees thereof are liable on the Series 2024 Bonds. In no event are the principal of and interest and redemption premium (if any) on Series 2024 Bonds payable out of any funds or properties of the District other than ad valorem taxes levied on taxable property in the District. The Series 2024 Bonds, including the interest thereon, are payable solely from taxes levied under Sections 15250 and 15252 of the Education Code.

The District hereby pledges all revenues from the property taxes collected from the levy by the County for the payment of the Series 2024 Bonds and the amounts in the Debt Service Fund (the “Pledged Revenues”) to the payment of the principal of and interest on the Series 2024 Bonds. It is the intention of the District that (i) for purposes of 11 U.S.C. §902(2)(E), the Pledged Revenues constitute “taxes specifically levied to finance one or more projects or systems” of the District and are not “general property, sales or income taxes . . . levied to finance the general purposes of” the District, and (ii) the pledge of the Pledged Revenues constitutes a pledge of “special revenues” for purposes of 11 U.S.C. §§901 et seq., and that a petition filed by the District under 11 U.S.C. §§901 et seq., will not operate as a stay under 11 U.S.C. §362 of the application of such Pledged Revenues to payment when due of principal of and interest on the Series 2024 Bonds. The District will not take any action inconsistent with its agreement and statement of intention hereunder and will not deny that the pledge of the Pledged Revenues constitutes a pledge of special revenues for purposes of 11 U.S.C. §§901 et seq.

SECTION 4.02. Establishment of Debt Service Fund. The District hereby directs the Director of Finance to hold and maintain a fund designated as the “San Juan Unified School District Election of 2024, Series Debt Service Fund,” which the Director of Finance shall hold as a separate account, distinct from all other funds of the County and the District. All taxes levied by the County, at the request of the District, for the payment of the principal of and interest and premium (if any) on the Series 2024 Bonds shall be deposited in the Debt Service Fund by the County promptly upon apportionment of said levy.

The Debt Service Fund is hereby pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Series 2024 Bonds when and as the same become due, including the principal of any term Series 2024 Bonds required to be paid upon the mandatory sinking fund redemption thereof. Amounts in the Debt Service Fund shall be transferred by the Director of Finance to the Paying Agent to the extent required to pay the principal of and interest and redemption premium (if any) on the Series 2024 Bonds when due. In addition, amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Fund shall be applied to pay the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent insofar as permitted by law, including specifically by Section 15232 of the Education Code.

SECTION 4.03. Disbursements from Debt Service Fund. The County shall administer the Debt Service Fund and make disbursements therefrom in the manner set forth in this Section. The Director of Finance shall transfer amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Fund, to the extent necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the Series 2024 Bonds when due and payable, to the Paying Agent which, in turn, shall pay such moneys to DTC to pay the principal of and interest on the Series 2024 Bonds. DTC will thereupon make payments of principal and interest on the Series 2024 Bonds to DTC Participants, who will thereupon make payments of principal and interest to the beneficial owners of the Series 2024 Bonds. Any moneys remaining in the Debt Service Fund after the Series 2024 Bonds and the interest thereon have been paid, or provision for such

This pledge shall be valid and binding from the date hereof for the benefit of the owners of the Series 2024 Bonds and successors thereto. The property taxes and amounts held in the Debt Service Fund shall be immediately subject to this pledge, and the pledge shall constitute a lien and security interest which shall immediately attach to the property taxes and amounts held in the interest and sinking fund to secure the District’s payment of the Series 2024 Bonds and shall be effective, binding, and enforceable against the District, its successors, creditors and all others irrespective of whether those parties have notice of the pledge and without the need of any physical delivery, recordation, filing, or further act.

The District hereby represents and warrants that all of its general obligation bonds, including the Series 2024 Bonds are or were issued to finance or refinance one or more of the projects specified in the applicable voter-approved measure.

Investments.** All moneys held in any of the funds or accounts established with the County hereunder will be invested in Authorized Investments in accordance with the investment policies of the County, as such policies exist at the time of investment.

All interest or gain derived from the investment of amounts in any of the funds or accounts established hereunder will be deposited in the fund or account from which such investment was made, and will be expended for the purposes thereof.

The District covenants that all investments of amounts deposited in any fund or account created by or under this Resolution, or otherwise containing proceeds of the Series 2024 Bonds, shall be acquired and disposed of at the Fair Market Value thereof. For purposes of this Section, the term “Fair Market Value” shall mean, with respect to any investment, the price at which a willing buyer would purchase such investment from a willing seller in a bona fide, arm’s length transaction (determined as of the date the contract to purchase or sell the investment becomes binding) if the investment is traded on an established securities market (within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Tax Code) and, otherwise, the term “Fair Market Value” means the acquisition price in a bona fide arm’s length transaction (as described above) if (i) the investment is a certificate of deposit that is acquired in accordance with applicable regulations under the Tax Code, (ii) the investment is an agreement with specifically negotiated withdrawal or reinvestment provisions and a specifically negotiated interest rate (for example, a guaranteed investment contract, a forward supply contract or other investment agreement) that is acquired in accordance with applicable regulations under the Tax Code, or (iii) the investment is a United States Treasury Security - State and Local Government Series that is acquired in accordance with applicable regulations of the United States Bureau of Public Debt.

The Paying Agent is not liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a responsible officer of its corporate trust department in the absence of the negligence of the Paying Agent.

No provision of this Resolution shall require the Paying Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it has reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.

The Paying Agent may execute any of the powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the Paying Agent is not responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder.

**SECTION 6.04.

A waiver of any default by any Series 2024 Bond Owner shall not affect any subsequent default or impair any rights or remedies on the subsequent default.

The issuance of the Bonds has been authorized by the requisite 55% vote of the electors of the District cast at a bond election held on November 8, 2016, upon the question of issuing bonds in the amount of $750,000,000.

This Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of authentication hereof, unless (a) it is authenticated as of a business day following the 15th day of the month immediately preceding any Interest Payment Date and on or before such Interest Payment Date, in which event it shall bear interest from such Interest Payment Date.

Payment Date, or (b) it is authenticated prior to July 15, 2024, in which event it shall bear interest from the Dated Date referred to above. Principal hereof is payable at the corporate trust office of the paying agent for the Bonds (the “Paying Agent”), initially the Director of Finance of the County.

Interest hereon (including the final interest payment upon maturity or redemption) is payable by check or draft of the Paying Agent mailed by first-class mail to the Owner at the Owner's address as it appears on the registration books maintained by the Paying Agent as of the close of business on the 15th day of the month next preceding such Interest Payment Date (the “Record Date”), or at such other address as the Owner may have filed with the Paying Agent for that purpose.

The Bonds are being issued in the form of current interest bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $__________ subject to the terms and conditions of the Bond Resolution. All capitalized terms herein and not otherwise defined have the meaning given them in the Bond Resolution. Reference is hereby made to the Bond Resolution (copies of which are on file at the office of the Paying Agent) and the Bond Law for a description of the terms on which the Bonds are issued and the rights thereunder of the owners of the Bonds and the rights, duties and immunities of the Paying Agent and the rights and obligations of the District thereunder, to all of the provisions of which Bond Resolution the Owner of this Bond, by acceptance hereof, assents and agrees.

The principal of and interest and redemption premium, if any, on this Bond does not constitute a debt of the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions other than the District, or any of the officers, agents and employees thereof and neither the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions, nor any of the officers, agents and employees thereof shall be liable hereon. In no event shall the principal of and interest and redemption premium, if any, on this Bond be payable out of any funds or properties of the District other than ad valorem taxes levied upon all taxable property in the District.

The Bonds of this issue are issuable only as fully registered Bonds in the denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. This Bond is exchangeable and transferable for Bonds of other authorized denominations at the principal corporate trust office of the Paying Agent, by the Registered Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so, upon presentation and surrender hereof to the Paying Agent, together with a request for exchange or an assignment signed by the Registered Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so, in a form satisfactory to the Paying Agent, all subject to the terms, limitations and conditions provided in the Bond Resolution. Any tax or governmental charges shall be paid by the transferor. The District and the Paying Agent may deem and treat the Registered Owner as the absolute owner of this Bond for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of principal or interest and for all other purposes, and neither the District nor the Paying Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

The Bonds maturing on or before August 1, 20__ are not subject to redemption prior to their respective stated maturities. The Bonds maturing on or after August 1, 20__ are subject to redemption prior to maturity as a whole, or in part among maturities on such basis as shall be designated by the District and by lot within a maturity, at the option of the District, from any available source of funds, on August 1, 20__ and on any date thereafter, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of Bonds to be

redeemed, together with interest thereon to the date fixed for redemption, without premium.

**[If applicable:]** The Bonds maturing on August 1, 20__ (the “Term Bonds”) are also subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption on or before August 1 in the years, and in the amounts, as set forth in the following table, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed (without premium), together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption; provided, however, that if some but not all of the Term Bonds have been redeemed under the preceding paragraph, the aggregate principal amount of Term Bonds to be redeemed under this paragraph shall be reduced on a pro rata basis in integral multiples of $5,000, or on such other basis as designated pursuant to written notice filed by the District with the Paying Agent.

| Sinking Fund Redemption Date (August 1) | Principal Amount To Be Redeemed |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
|                                          |                                  |

The Paying Agent shall give notice of the redemption of the Bonds at the expense of the District. Such notice shall specify: (a) that the Bonds or a designated portion thereof are to be redeemed, (b) the numbers and CUSIP numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed, (c) the date of notice and the date of redemption, (d) the place or places where the redemption will be made, and (e) descriptive information regarding the Bonds including the dated date, interest rate and stated maturity date. Such notice shall further state that on the specified date there shall become due and payable upon each Bond to be redeemed, the portion of the principal amount of such Bond to be redeemed, together with interest accrued to said date, the redemption premium, if any, and that from and after such date interest with respect thereto shall cease to accrue and be payable. Such notice may be conditional and subject to rescission as described in the Bond Resolution.

Notice of redemption shall be by registered or otherwise secured mail or delivery service, postage prepaid, to the registered owner of the Bonds, to a municipal registered securities depository and to a national information service that disseminates securities redemption notices and, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the District and the respective Owners of any Bonds designated for redemption at their addresses appearing on the Bond registration books, in every case at least 20 days, but not more than 60 days, prior to the redemption date; provided that neither failure to receive such notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for the redemption of such Bonds.

Neither the District nor the Paying Agent will be required: (a) to issue or transfer any Bond during a period beginning with the opening of business on the 15th calendar day next preceding either any Interest Payment Date or any date of selection of any Bond to be redeemed and ending with the close of business on the Interest Payment Date or a day on which the applicable notice of redemption is given, or (b) to transfer any Bond which has been selected or called for redemption in whole or in part.

Reference is made to the Bond Resolution for a more complete description of the provisions, among others, with respect to the nature and extent of the security for the

Bonds of this series, the rights, duties and obligations of the District, the Paying Agent and the Registered Owners, and the terms and conditions upon which the Bonds are issued and secured. The owner of this Bond assents, by acceptance hereof, to all of the provisions of the Bond Resolution.

It is certified, recited and declared that all acts and conditions required by the Constitution and laws of the State of California to exist, to be performed or to have been met precedent to and in the issuing of the Bonds in order to make them legal, valid and binding general obligations of the District, have been performed and have been met in regular and due form as required by law; that payment in full for the Bonds has been received; that no statutory or constitutional limitation on indebtedness or taxation has been exceeded in issuing the Bonds; and that due provision has been made for levying and collecting ad valorem property taxes on all of the taxable property within the District in an amount sufficient to pay principal and interest when due, and for levying and collecting such taxes the full faith and credit of the District are hereby pledged.

Unless this Bond is presented by an authorized representative of The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation (“DTC”), to the Paying Agent for registration of transfer, exchange, or payment, and any Bond issued is registered in the name of Cede & Co. or in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC (and any payment is made to Cede & Co. or to such other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE, OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL inasmuch as the registered owner hereof, Cede & Co., has an interest in this Bond.

This Bond shall be not valid or obligatory for any purpose and is not entitled to any security or benefit under the Bond Resolution until the Certificate of Authentication below has been manually signed by the Paying Agent.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the San Juan Unified School District has caused this Bond to be executed by the facsimile signature of its President and attested by the facsimile signature of the Secretary of its Board of Education, all as of the date stated above.

## Authority for Issuance

The Bonds will be issued under the provisions of Article 4.5 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code, commencing with Section 53506 thereof, and the Bond Resolution. The District received authorization by more than the requisite 55% of District voters at the Bond Election to issue general obligation bonds in a principal amount of $750,000,000 (the “2016 Authorization”).

Pursuant to the 2016 Authorization, (i) on March 14, 2017, the District issued its $39,920,000 aggregate principal amount General Obligation Bonds Election of 2016, Series 2017 (the “Election of 2016, Series 2017 Bonds”) pursuant to the 2016 Authorization, (ii) on January 22, 2019, the District issued its $80,000,000 aggregate principal amount General Obligation Bonds Election of 2016, Series 2019 (the “Election of 2016, Series 2019 Bonds”), (iii) on October 29, 2020, the District issued its $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of General Obligation Bonds Election of 2016, Series 2020 (the “Election of 2016, Series 2020 Bonds”), and (iv) on May 11, 2022, the District issued its $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of General Obligation Bonds Election of 2016, Series 2022 (the “Election of 2016, Series 2022 Bonds”). The Bonds are the fifth series of bonds issued pursuant to the 2016 Authorization. Following the issuance of the Bonds, there will be $330,080,000 of unused authorization remaining under the 2016 Authorization.*

## Purpose of Issue

Proceeds of the Bonds will be used for the purposes specified in the ballot measure approved by voters in the District on November 8, 2016, the abbreviated text of which appeared on the ballot as follows:

“To repair/upgrade all schools by: repairing aging/deteriorating classrooms/bathrooms/leaky roofs/plumbing/drinking fountains/water pipes/electrical wiring; upgrading classroom technology, math/science/computer labs, vocational education classrooms, and outdated fire safety/security systems; removing asbestos/lead paint; and, repairing, constructing, and acquiring educational facilities/equipment, shall San Juan Unified School District issue $750,000,000 in bonds at legal rates, requiring annual independent financial audits, citizens oversight, and keeping all funds local?”

The District makes no representation as to the specific application of the proceeds of the Bonds, the completion of any projects listed on the Project List, or whether bonds authorized by the 2016 Authorization will provide sufficient funds to complete any particular project listed in the Project List.

# Description of the Bonds

The Bonds are being issued as current interest bonds. The Bonds mature in the years and in the amounts set forth on the inside cover page hereof. The Bonds will be issued in book-entry form only, and will be initially issued and registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee for DTC. Purchasers will not receive physical certificates representing their interest in the Bonds. See “Book-Entry Only System” and APPENDIX F.

The Bonds shall be issued in the denominations of $5,000 principal amount each or any integral multiple thereof. Interest on Bonds is payable semiannually on each February 1 and August 1, commencing August 1, 2024 (each, an “Interest Payment Date”). Each Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of registration and authentication thereof unless (i) it is authenticated as of an Interest Payment Date, in which event it will bear interest from such date, (ii) it is authenticated prior to an Interest Payment Date and after the close of business on the fifteenth (15th) day of the month preceding the Interest Payment Date (each, a “Record Date”), in which event it will bear interest from such Interest Payment Date, or (iii) it is authenticated prior to July 15, 2024, in which event it will bear interest from the date of delivery of the Bonds identified on the cover page hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if interest on any Bond is in default at the time of authentication thereof, such Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date to which interest has previously been paid or made available for payment thereon. Payments of principal and interest on the Bonds will be paid by Director of Finance of the County, as the designated paying agent, registrar and transfer agent (the “Paying Agent”) to DTC for subsequent disbursement to DTC Participants who will remit such payments to the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds.

# Book-Entry Only System

The Bonds will be issued in book-entry form only, and will be initially issued and registered in the name of Cede & Co. as nominee of DTC. Purchasers of the Bonds will not receive physical certificates representing their interest in the Bonds. Payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds will be paid by the Paying Agent to DTC for subsequent disbursement to DTC Participants which will remit such payments to the Beneficial Owners of the Bonds.

As long as DTC’s book-entry method is used for the Bonds, the Paying Agent will send any notice of prepayment or other notices to owners only to DTC. Any failure of DTC to advise any DTC Participant, or of any DTC Participant to notify any Beneficial Owner, of any such notice and its content or effect will not affect the validity or sufficiency of the proceedings relating to the prepayment of the Bonds called for prepayment or any other action premised on such notice. See APPENDIX F.

The Paying Agent, the District, and the Underwriters of the Bonds have no responsibility or liability for any aspects of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to beneficial ownership, of interests in the Bonds.

# Redemption*

**Optional Redemption.** The Bonds maturing on or before August 1, 20__ are not subject to redemption prior to maturity. The Bonds maturing on or after August 1, 20__ are subject to redemption prior to maturity, at the option of the District, in whole or in part among maturities on such

*Preliminary; subject to change.
<!-- Page 344 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

basis as shall be designated by the District and by lot within a maturity, from any available source of funds, on August 1, 20__, or on any date thereafter, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, without premium, together with accrued interest thereon to the redemption date.

Whenever less than all of the outstanding Bonds of any one maturity are designated for redemption, the Paying Agent will select the outstanding Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed by lot in any manner deemed fair by the Paying Agent or as otherwise directed by the District. For the purpose of selection for optional redemption, Bonds will be deemed to consist of $5,000 portions (principal amount), and any such portion may be separately redeemed. The Bonds may all be separately redeemed.

**Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption.** The Bonds maturing on August 1, 20__ (the “Term Bonds”), are subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption on August 1 of each year in accordance with the schedule set forth below. The Term Bonds so called for mandatory sinking fund redemption will be redeemed in the sinking fund payments amounts and on the dates set forth below, without premium, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption.

**Term Bonds Maturing August 1, 20__**

| Redemption Date (August 1) | Sinking Fund Redemption |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
|                             |                         |

If any Term Bonds are redeemed pursuant to optional redemption, the total amount of all future sinking fund payments with respect to such Term Bonds shall be reduced by the aggregate principal amount of such Term Bonds so redeemed, to be allocated among such payments on a pro rata basis in integral multiples of $5,000 principal amount (or on such other basis as the District may determine) as set forth in written notice given by the District to the Paying Agent.

**Notice of Redemption**

The Paying Agent shall give notice of the redemption of the Bonds at the expense of the District to be mailed, first class, postage prepaid, at least 20 but not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, to the owners of the Bonds designated for redemption. Such notice shall specify: (a) that the Bonds or a designated portion thereof are to be redeemed, (b) the numbers and CUSIP numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed, (c) the date of redemption, (d) the place or places where the redemption will be made, and (e) descriptive information regarding the Bonds including the date, interest rate and stated maturity date. Such notice shall further state that on the specified date there shall become due and payable upon each Bond to be redeemed, the portion of the principal amount of such Bond to be redeemed, together with interest accrued to said date, the redemption premium, if any, and that from and after such date interest with respect thereto shall cease to accrue and be payable. Such notice may be a conditional notice of redemption and subject to rescission as set forth below.

Neither the failure to receive or failure to send any notice of redemption nor any defect in any such redemption notice so given shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for the redemption of the affected Bonds.

<!-- Page 345 -->
![Partial Redemption of Bonds](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Partial+Redemption+of+Bonds)

**Partial Redemption of Bonds**  
Upon surrender of Bonds redeemed in part only, the District will execute and the Paying Agent will authenticate and deliver to the owner, at the expense of the District, a new Bond or Bonds, of the same maturity, of authorized denominations in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Bond or Bonds.

**Effect of Redemption**  
From and after the date fixed for redemption, if notice of such redemption has been duly given and funds available for the payment of the principal of and interest (and premium, if any) on the Bonds so called for redemption have been duly provided, such Bonds so called will cease to be entitled to any benefit under the Bond Resolution, other than the right to receive payment of the redemption price, and no interest will accrue thereon on or after the redemption date specified in such notice.

**Right to Rescind Notice of Redemption**  
The District has the right to rescind any notice of the optional redemption of Bonds by written notice to the Paying Agent on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. Any notice of redemption shall be cancelled and annulled if for any reason funds will not be or are not available on the date fixed for redemption for the payment in full of the Bonds then called for redemption. The District and the Paying Agent have no liability to the Bond owners or any other party related to or arising from such rescission of redemption. The Paying Agent shall mail notice of such rescission of redemption in the same manner as the original notice of redemption was sent under the Bond Resolution.

**Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Bonds**  
If the book-entry system is discontinued, the District shall cause the Paying Agent to maintain and keep at its principal corporate trust office all books and records necessary for the registration, exchange and transfer of the Bonds.

If the book-entry system is discontinued, the person in whose name a Bond is registered on the Bond registration books shall be regarded as the absolute owner of that Bond. Payment of the principal of and interest on any Bond shall be made only to or upon the order of that person; neither the District, the County nor the Paying Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary, but the registration may be changed as provided in the Bond Resolution.

Bonds may be exchanged at the principal corporate trust office of the Paying Agent in Los Angeles, California for a like aggregate principal amount of Bonds of authorized denominations and of the same maturity. Any Bond may, in accordance with its terms, but only if (i) the District determines to no longer maintain the book-entry only status of the Bonds, (ii) DTC determines to discontinue providing such services and no successor securities depository is named or (iii) DTC requests the District to deliver Bond certificates to particular DTC Participants, be transferred, upon the books required to be kept pursuant to the provisions of the Bond Resolution, by the person in whose name it is registered, in person or by his duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of such Bond for cancellation at the office of the Paying Agent, accompanied by delivery of a written instrument of transfer in a form approved by the Paying Agent, duly executed.
<!-- Page 346 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

No exchanges of Bonds shall be required to be made (a) fifteen days prior to the date established by the Paying Agent for selection of Bonds for redemption or (b) with respect to a Bond after such Bond has been selected or called for redemption in whole or in part.

## Defeasance and Discharge of Bonds

The Bonds may be paid by the District, in whole or in part, in any one or more of the following ways:

(a) by paying or causing to be paid the principal or redemption price of and interest on such Bonds, as and when the same become due and payable;

(b) by irrevocably depositing, in trust, at or before maturity, money or securities in the necessary amount (as provided in the Bond Resolution) to pay or redeem such Bonds; or

(c) by delivering such Bonds to the Paying Agent for cancellation by it.

Whenever in the Bond Resolution it is provided or permitted that there be deposited with or held in trust by the Paying Agent money or securities in the necessary amount to pay or redeem any Bonds, the money or securities so to be deposited or held may be held by the Paying Agent or by any other fiduciary. Such money or securities may include money or securities held by the Paying Agent in the funds and accounts established under the Bond Resolution and will be:

(i) lawful money of the United States of America in an amount equal to the principal amount of such Bonds and all unpaid interest thereon to maturity, except that, in the case of Bonds which are to be redeemed prior to maturity and in respect of which notice of such redemption is given as provided in the Bond Resolution or provision satisfactory to the Paying Agent is made for the giving of such notice, the amount to be deposited or held will be the principal amount or redemption price of such Bonds and all unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date; or

(ii) Federal Securities (not callable by the issuer thereof prior to maturity) the principal of and interest on which when due, in the opinion of a certified public accountant delivered to the District, will provide money sufficient to pay the principal or redemption price of and all unpaid interest to maturity, or to the redemption date, as the case may be, on the Bonds to be paid or redeemed, as such principal or redemption price and interest become due, provided that, in the case of Bonds which are to be redeemed prior to the maturity thereof, notice of such redemption is given as provided in the Bond Resolution or provision satisfactory to the Paying Agent is made for the giving of such notice.

Upon the deposit, in trust, at or before maturity, of money or securities in the necessary amount (as described above) to pay or redeem any outstanding Bond (whether upon or prior to its maturity or the redemption date of such Bond), then all liability of the County and the District in respect of such Bond will cease and be completely discharged, except only that thereafter the owner thereof will be entitled only to payment of the principal of and interest on such Bond by the District, and the District will remain liable for such payment, but only out of such money or securities deposited with the Paying Agent for such payment.

![SECURITY FOR THE BONDS](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=SECURITY+FOR+THE+BONDS)

**Ad Valorem Taxes**

**Bonds Payable from Ad Valorem Property Taxes.** The Bonds are general obligations of the District, payable solely from ad valorem property taxes levied on taxable property within the District and collected by the County. The County is empowered and is obligated to annually levy ad valorem property taxes for the payment of the Bonds and the interest thereon upon all property within the District subject to taxation by the District, without limitation of rate or amount (except certain personal property which is taxable at limited rates).

**Other Debt Payable from Ad Valorem Property Taxes.** In addition to the Bonds, there is other debt issued by the District and other entities with jurisdiction in the District, which is payable from ad valorem property taxes levied on all property in the District. See “PROPERTY TAXATION – Tax Rates” and “- Direct and Overlapping Debt” below.

**Levy, Collection and Pledge of Taxes.** The County will levy and collect such ad valorem property taxes in such amounts and at such times as is necessary to ensure the timely payment of debt service. Such taxes, when collected, will be deposited into a debt service fund for the Bonds, which is held by the County and which is irrevocably pledged for the payment of principal of and interest on the Bonds when due.

District property taxes are assessed and collected by the County in the same manner and at the same time, and in the same installments as other ad valorem taxes on real property, and will have the same priority, become delinquent at the same times and in the same proportionate amounts, and bear the same proportionate penalties and interest after delinquency, as do the other ad valorem taxes on real property.

**Statutory Lien on Ad Valorem Tax Revenues.** Under California law, voter-approved general obligation bonds which are secured by ad valorem property tax collections, including the Bonds, are secured by a statutory lien on all revenues received pursuant to the levy and collection of the property tax imposed to service those bonds. Said lien attaches automatically and is valid and binding from the time the bonds are executed and delivered. The lien is enforceable against the District, its successors, transferees, and creditors, and all others asserting rights therein, irrespective of whether those parties have notice of the lien and without the need for any further act.

**Annual Tax Rates.** The amount of the annual ad valorem property tax levied by the County to repay the Bonds will be determined by the relationship between the assessed valuation of taxable property in the District and the amount of debt service due on the Bonds. Fluctuations in the annual debt service on the Bonds and the assessed value of taxable property in the District may cause the annual tax rate to fluctuate.

**Natural Disasters.** Economic and other factors beyond the District’s control, such as economic recession, deflation of property values, pandemics, a relocation out of the District or financial difficulty or bankruptcy by one or more major property taxpayers, or the complete or partial destruction of taxable property caused by, among other eventualities, earthquake, flood, fire, drought, climate change or other natural disaster, could cause a reduction in the assessed value within the District and necessitate a corresponding increase in the annual tax rate. See “PROPERTY TAXATION – Assessed Valuations – Factors Relating to Increases/Decreases in Assessed Value.”

![Building Fund](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Building+Fund)

**Building Fund**  
Proceeds from the sale of the Bonds, to the extent of the principal amount thereof, will be paid to the County to the credit of the fund created and established in the Bond Resolution and known as the “San Juan Unified School District, Election of 2016, Series 2024 Building Fund” (the “Building Fund”), which will be accounted for as separate and distinct from all other District funds. The proceeds will be used solely for the purposes for which the Bonds are being issued and for payment of permissible costs of issuance. Any excess proceeds of the Bonds not needed for the authorized purposes for which the Bonds are being issued shall be transferred to the Debt Service Fund and applied to the payment of principal and interest on the Bonds. If, after payment in full of the Bonds, there remains excess proceeds, any such excess amounts shall be transferred to the general fund of the District. Interest earnings on the investment of monies held in the Building Fund will be retained in the Building Fund.

**Debt Service Fund**  
Amounts to pay debt service on the Bonds will be held in the fund created and established in the Bond Resolution and known as the “San Juan Unified School District, Election of 2016, Series 2024 Debt Service Fund” (the “Debt Service Fund”) for the Bonds, which will be established as a separate fund to be maintained distinct from all other funds of the District. All taxes levied by the County for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds will be deposited in the Debt Service Fund by the County promptly upon the receipt. The Debt Service Fund is pledged for the payment of the principal of and interest and premium (if any) on the Bonds when due as the same become due. The County will transfer amounts in the Debt Service Fund to the Paying Agent to the extent necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the Bonds as the same becomes due and payable.  
If, after payment in full of the Bonds, any amounts remain on deposit in the Debt Service Fund, the County shall transfer such amounts to the District’s general fund, to be applied solely in a manner which is consistent with the requirements of applicable state and federal tax law.

**Not a County Obligation**  
The Bonds are payable solely from the proceeds of an ad valorem property tax levied and collected by the County, for the payment of principal and interest on the Bonds. Although the County is obligated to collect the ad valorem property tax for the payment of the Bonds, the Bonds are not a debt of the County.

# PROPERTY TAXATION

## Property Tax Collection Procedures

In California, property subject to ad valorem taxes is classified as “secured” or “unsecured.” The “secured roll” is that part of the assessment roll containing state assessed public utilities’ property and real property, the taxes on which create a lien on such property sufficient, in the opinion of the county assessor, to secure payment of the taxes. A tax levied on unsecured property does not become a lien against such unsecured property, but may become a lien on certain other property owned by the taxpayer. Every tax which becomes a lien on secured property has priority over all other liens arising pursuant to State law on such secured property, regardless of the time of the creation of the other liens. Secured and unsecured property are entered separately on the assessment roll maintained by the county assessor. The method of collecting delinquent taxes is substantially different for the two classifications of property.

Property taxes on the secured roll are due in two installments, on November 1 and February 1 of each fiscal year. If unpaid, such taxes become delinquent after December 10 and April 10, respectively, and a 10% penalty attaches to any delinquent payment. In addition, property on the secured roll with respect to which taxes are delinquent is declared tax defaulted on or about June 30 of the fiscal year. Such property may thereafter be redeemed by payment of the delinquent taxes and a delinquency penalty, plus a redemption penalty of 1.5% per month to the time of redemption. If taxes are unpaid for a period of five years or more, the property is subject to sale by the county in which the property is located.

Property taxes are levied for each fiscal year on taxable real and personal property situated in the taxing jurisdiction as of the preceding January 1. However, Senate Bill 813 ( enacted Statutes of 1983, Chapter 498) (“SB 813”), provided for the supplemental assessment and taxation of property as of the occurrence of a change of ownership or completion of new construction. Thus, this legislation eliminated delays in the realization of increased property taxes from new assessments. As amended, SB 813 provided increased revenue to taxing jurisdictions to the extent that supplemental assessments of new construction or changes of ownership occur subsequent to the January 1 lien date and result in increased assessed value.

Property taxes on the unsecured roll are due on the January 1 lien date and become delinquent, if unpaid on the following August 31. A 10% penalty is also attached to delinquent taxes in respect of property on the unsecured roll, and further, an additional penalty of 1.5% per month accrues with respect to such taxes beginning the first day of the third month following the delinquency date. The taxing authority has four ways of collecting unsecured personal property taxes: (1) a civil action against the taxpayer; (2) filing a certificate in the office of the county clerk specifying certain facts in order to obtain a judgment lien on certain property of the taxpayer; (3) filing a certificate of delinquency for record in the county recorder’s office, in order to obtain a lien on certain property of the taxpayer; and (4) seizure and sale of personal property, improvements or possessory interests belonging or assessed to the assessee. The exclusive means of enforcing the payment of delinquent taxes in respect of property on the secured roll is the sale of the property securing the taxes for the amount of taxes which are delinquent.

## Taxation of State-Assessed Utility Property

The State Constitution provides that most classes of property owned or used by regulated utilities be assessed by the State Board of Equalization (“SBE”) and taxed locally. Property valued by the SBE as an operating unit in a primary function of the utility taxpayer is known as “unitary.”

**Factors Relating to Increases/Decreases in Assessed Value.** As indicated in the previous table, assessed valuations are subject to change in each year. Increases or decreases in assessed valuation result from a variety of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions, supply and demand for real property in the area, government regulations such as zoning, and disasters such as wildfires, earthquakes, droughts, floods, climate change and pandemics, among others. The District cannot predict or make any representations regarding the effects that natural disasters or other conditions have or may have on the value of taxable property within the District or to what extent the effects said disasters might have on economic activity in the District or throughout the State.
<!-- Page 355 -->
![Wildfires](https://example.com/wildfires-image)  
Wildfires. According to the State, fire season is starting earlier and ending later each year, with the increased length of the season corresponding to an increase in the extent of forest fires across the State. In addition to destroying land and structures, there have been human fatalities and negative impacts on air quality throughout the State. Fires in the State and neighboring states have threatened the region’s power grids, making some power lines unreliable. The District cannot predict or make any representations regarding the effects that wildfires and related conditions have or may have on the District, or to what extent the effects said disasters might have on economic activity in the District or throughout the State.

Seismic Events. The District is located in a seismically active region. An earthquake of large magnitude could result in extensive damage to property within the District and could adversely affect the assessed valuation of property within the District, or more generally the region’s economy.

Drought. The State has experienced drought conditions in recent years, including a period of drought followed by record-level precipitation, which resulted in related severe flooding and mudslides in certain regions. As of October 17, 2023, the U.S. Drought Monitor indicates that the State is classified as experiencing mostly no drought conditions with some moderate and abnormally dry conditions, with the County in the no drought category. During 2021, the Governor of the State proclaimed a drought state of emergency for all counties in the State, culminating with an October 19, 2021, proclamation, urging Californians to step up their water conservation efforts.

In January 2022, the State Water Board adopted emergency regulations aimed at saving water and raising drought awareness, with prohibitions focused on reducing outdoor water use, enforceable by local agencies and the State Water Board, generally with warning letters, mandatory water use audits, and fines. Local agencies can impose and enforce their own drought-related rules.

Climate Change. In addition to the events described above, climate change caused by human activities may have adverse effects on the assessed value of property within the District. As greenhouse gas emissions continue to accumulate in the atmosphere as a result of economic activity, many scientists expect that climate change will intensify, increasing the frequency, severity and timing of extreme weather events such as coastal storm surges, droughts, wildfires, floods, heat waves, and rising sea levels. Projections of the impact of global climate change are complex and depend on a variety of factors outside of the District’s control. The various scientific studies that forecast the amount and timing of adverse impacts of climate change are based on assumptions contained in such studies, but actual events may vary materially. In addition, the scientific understanding of climate change and its effects continues to evolve. Accordingly, the District in unable to forecast with certainty when or if adverse impacts of climate change will occur or the extent of such impacts.

Public Health Emergencies. In recent years, public health authorities have warned of threats posed by outbreaks of disease and other public health threats. On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name for the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 (“COVID-19”), an upper respiratory tract illness, that spread across the globe. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on the District’s operations and finances and the economy, real estate market, development within the District and tax collections may not be fully known, and it may be some time before the full adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is known. Further, there could be future COVID-19 outbreaks or other public health emergencies that could have material adverse effects on the District’s operations and finances. In addition, the District cannot predict whether future pandemics will occur and whether any such pandemics may impact its finances or operations. As of this date, several vaccines have been provided approval by federal health authorities and are widely available.

![Property Tax Base Transfer Ballot Measure](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Property+Tax+Base+Transfer+Ballot+Measure)

**Property Tax Base Transfer Ballot Measure.** On November 3, 2020, State voters approved a constitutional amendment entitled Property Tax Transfers, Exemptions and Revenue for Wildfire Agencies and Counties Amendment (“Proposition 19”), which will: (i) expand special rules that give property tax savings to homeowners that are over the age of 55, severely disabled, or whose property has been impacted by a natural disaster or contamination, when they buy a different home; (ii) narrow existing special rules for inherited properties; and (iii) broaden the scope of legal entity ownership changes that trigger reassessment of properties. The District cannot make any assurance as to what effect the implementation of Proposition 19 will have on assessed valuation of real property in the District.

**Reassessments and Appeals of Assessed Value**

There are general means by which assessed values can be reassessed or appealed that could adversely impact property tax revenues within the District.

Appeals may be based on Proposition 8 of November 1978, which requires that for each January 1 lien date, the taxable value of real property must be the lesser of its base year value, annually adjusted by the inflation factor pursuant to Article XIII A of the California Constitution, or its full cash value, taking into account reductions in value due to damage, destruction, depreciation, obsolescence, removal of property or other factors causing a decline in value. See “CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS – Article XIII A of the California Constitution” in APPENDIX A.

Under California law, property owners may apply for a Proposition 8 reduction of their property tax assessment by filing a written application, in form prescribed by the SBE, with the County board of equalization or assessment appeals board. In most cases, the appeal is filed.
<!-- Page 359 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)

because the applicant believes that present market conditions (such as residential home prices) cause the property to be worth less than its current assessed value.

Any reduction in the assessment ultimately granted as a result of such appeal applies to the year for which application is made and during which the written application was filed. These reductions are subject to yearly reappraisals and are adjusted back to their original values, adjusted for inflation, when market conditions improve. Once the property has regained its prior value, adjusted for inflation, it once again is subject to the annual inflationary factor growth rate allowed under Article XIII A.

A second type of assessment appeal involves a challenge to the base year value of an assessed property. Appeals for reduction in the base year value of an assessment, if successful, reduce the assessment for the year in which the appeal is taken and prospectively thereafter. The base year is determined by the completion date of new construction or the date of change of ownership. Any base year appeal must be made within four years of the change of ownership or new construction date.

Proposition 8 reductions may also be unilaterally applied by the County Assessor. The District cannot predict the changes in assessed values that might result from pending or future appeals by taxpayers or by reductions initiated by the County Assessor. Any reduction in aggregate District assessed valuation due to appeals, as with any reduction in assessed valuation due to other causes, will cause the tax rate levied to repay the Bonds to increase accordingly, so that the fixed debt service on the Bonds (and other outstanding general obligation bonds, if any) may be paid.

# Tax Levies and Delinquencies

The Board of Supervisors of the County has adopted the Alternative Method of Distribution of Tax Levies and Collections and of Tax Sale Proceeds (the “Teeter Plan”), as provided for in Section 4701 et seq. of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. Under the Teeter Plan, each entity levying property taxes in the County may draw on the amount of uncollected secured taxes credited to its fund in the same manner as if the amount credited had been collected. The District participates in the Teeter Plan, and thus receives 100% of secured property taxes levied in exchange for foregoing any interest and penalties collected on delinquent taxes. Currently, the County includes the District’s general obligation bond levies in its Teeter Plan.

So long as the Teeter Plan remains in effect and the County continues to include the District in the Teeter Plan, the District’s receipt of revenues with respect to the levy of ad valorem property taxes on the secured roll will not be dependent upon actual collections of the ad valorem property taxes by the County. However, under the statute creating the Teeter Plan, the Board of Supervisors could under certain circumstances terminate the Teeter Plan in its entirety and, in addition, the Board of Supervisors could terminate the Teeter Plan with respect to the District if the delinquency rate for all ad valorem property taxes levied within the District in any year exceeds 3%.

Notwithstanding the operation of the Teeter Plans, below is a recent history of secured tax charges and delinquencies in the District with respect to the bond debt service levy.

# Top 20 Property Owners

The following table shows the 20 largest taxpayers in the District as determined by their secured assessed valuations in fiscal year 2023-24. Each taxpayer listed below is a unique name listed on the tax rolls. The District cannot determine from County assessment records whether individual persons, corporations or other organizations are liable for tax payments with respect to multiple properties held in various names that in aggregate may be larger than is suggested by the table below. A large concentration of ownership in a single individual or entity results in a greater amount of tax collections which are dependent upon that property owner's ability or willingness to pay property taxes.

## Direct and Overlapping Debt

Set forth below is a direct and overlapping debt report (the “Debt Report”) prepared by California Municipal Statistics, Inc., for debt issued as of December 1, 2023. The Debt Report is included for general information purposes only. The District has not reviewed the Debt Report for completeness or accuracy and makes no representation in connection therewith.

The Debt Report generally includes long-term obligations sold in the public credit markets by public agencies whose boundaries overlap the boundaries of the District in whole or in part. Such long-term obligations generally are not payable from revenues of the District (except as indicated) nor are they necessarily obligations secured by land within the District. In many cases, long-term obligations issued by a public agency are payable only from the general fund or other revenues of such public agency.

# TAX MATTERS

## Tax Exemption

**Federal Tax Status.** In the opinion of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, San Francisco, California, Bond Counsel, subject, however to the qualifications set forth below, under existing law, the interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and such interest is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax. Interest on the Bonds may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax.

The opinions set forth in the preceding paragraph are subject to the condition that the District comply with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Tax Code") relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds. The District has made certain representations and covenants in order to comply with each such requirement. Inaccuracy of those representations, or failure to comply with certain of those covenants, may cause the inclusion of such interest in gross income for federal income tax purposes, which may be retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds.

## Tax Treatment of Original Issue Discount and Premium.

If the initial offering price to the public at which a Bond is sold is less than the amount payable at maturity thereof, then such difference constitutes "original issue discount" for purposes of federal income taxes and State of California personal income taxes. If the initial offering price to the public at which a Bond is sold is greater than the amount payable at maturity thereof, then such difference constitutes "original issue premium" for purposes of federal income taxes and State of California personal income taxes. De minimis original issue discount and original issue premium are disregarded.

Under the Tax Code, original issue discount is treated as interest excluded from federal gross income and exempt from State of California personal income taxes to the extent properly allocable to each owner thereof subject to the limitations described in the first paragraph of this section. The original issue discount accrues over the term to maturity of the Bond on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded on each interest or principal payment date (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The amount of original issue discount accruing during each period is added to the adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable gain upon disposition (including sale, redemption, or payment on maturity) of such Bond. The Tax Code contains certain provisions relating to the accrual of original issue discount in case of purchasers of the Bonds who purchase the Bonds after the initial offering of a substantial amount of such maturity. Owners of such Bonds should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of Bonds with original issue discount, including the treatment of purchasers who do not purchase in the original offering, the allowance of a deduction for any loss on a sale or other disposition, and the treatment of accrued original issue discount on such Bonds under federal individual alternative minimum taxes.

Under the Tax Code, original issue premium is amortized on an annual basis over the term of the Bond (said term being the shorter of the Bond's maturity date or its call date). The amount of original issue premium amortized each year reduces the adjusted basis of the owner of the Bond for purposes of determining taxable gain or loss upon disposition. The amount of original issue premium on a Bond is amortized each year over the term to maturity of the Bond.

on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded on each interest or principal payment date (with straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). Amortized Bond premium is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. Owners of premium Bonds, including purchasers who do not purchase in the original offering, should consult their own tax advisors with respect to State of California personal income tax and federal income tax consequences of owning such Bonds.

California Tax Status. In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the Bonds is exempt from California personal income taxes.

Other Tax Considerations. Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Tax Code or court decisions may cause interest on the Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent beneficial owners from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of such interest. The introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals, clarification of the Tax Code or court decisions may also affect the market price for, or marketability of, the Bonds. It cannot be predicted whether or in what form any such proposal might be enacted or whether, if enacted, such legislation would apply to bonds issued prior to enactment.

The opinions expressed by Bond Counsel are based upon existing legislation and regulations as interpreted by relevant judicial and regulatory authorities as of the date of such opinion, and Bond Counsel has expressed no opinion with respect to any proposed legislation or as to the tax treatment of interest on the Bonds, or as to the consequences of owning or receiving interest on the Bonds, as of any future date. Prospective purchasers of the Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding any pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel expresses no opinion.

Owners of the Bonds should also be aware that the ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds may have federal or state tax consequences other than as described above. Other than as expressly described above, Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding other federal or state tax consequences arising with respect to the Bonds, the ownership, sale or disposition of the Bonds, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on the Bonds.

Form of Opinion. A copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is attached hereto as Appendix D.

# CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS

## Legality for Investment

Under provisions of the California Financial Code, the Bonds are legal investments for commercial banks in California to the extent that the Bonds, in the informed opinion of the investing bank, are prudent for the investment of funds of depositors, and under provisions of the California Government Code, the Bonds are eligible to secure deposits of public moneys in California.

## Absence of Litigation

No litigation is pending or threatened concerning the validity of the Bonds, and a certificate to that effect will be furnished to purchasers at the time of the original delivery of the Bonds. The District is not aware of any litigation pending or threatened that (i) questions the political existence of the District, (ii) contests the District's ability to receive ad valorem property taxes or to collect other revenues or (iii) contests the District's ability to issue and sell the Bonds.

The District is routinely subject to lawsuits and claims. In the opinion of the District, the aggregate amount of the uninsured liabilities of the District under these lawsuits and claims will not materially affect the financial position or operations of the District. The District may be or may become a party to lawsuits and claims which are unrelated to the Bonds or actions taken with respect to the Bonds and which have arisen in the normal course of operating the District, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The District maintains certain insurance policies which provide coverage under certain circumstances and with respect to certain incidents. The District cannot predict what types of claims may arise in the future.

## Compensation of Certain Professionals

Payment of the fees and expenses of Jones Hall, A Professional Law Corporation, as Bond Counsel and Disclosure Counsel to the District, Isom Advisors, a Division of Urban Futures, Inc., as municipal advisor to the District, and Norton Rose Fulbright US LLP, as counsel to the Underwriters, are contingent upon issuance of the Bonds.

# APPENDIX A

## GENERAL AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION  
### ABOUT THE DISTRICT  

The information in this and other sections concerning the District's operations and operating budget is provided as supplementary information only, and it should not be inferred from the inclusion of this information in this Official Statement that the principal of or interest on the Bonds is payable from the general fund of the District. The Bonds are payable from the proceeds of an ad valorem property tax required to be levied by the County in an amount sufficient for the payment thereof. See "SECURITY FOR THE BONDS" in the forepart of the Official Statement.

## GENERAL INFORMATION  

The District, located in the northeast portion of Sacramento County (the "County") in the State of California, (the "State"), was established in 1960. The District is approximately 75 square miles in area and serves portions of the city of Citrus Heights and the unincorporated areas of Carmichael, Fair Oaks, Gold River and Orangevale. The District also includes small portions of the cities of Sacramento, Folsom and Rancho Cordova. The District currently operates 64 schools, including 9 comprehensive high schools, 9 middle schools, 33 elementary schools, 8 K-8 schools, 3 alternative education programs, and 3 special education centers. Nine charter schools also operate within the boundaries of the District. The District provides kindergarten through 12th grade education to approximately 37,911 students.

For more information regarding the District and its finances see APPENDIX B attached hereto. See also APPENDIX C hereto for demographic and other statistical information regarding the County.

### Charter Schools  

Charter schools are largely independent schools operating as part of the public school system created pursuant to Part 26.8 (beginning with Section 47600) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the State Education Code (the "Charter School Law"). A charter school is usually created or organized by a group of teachers, parents and community leaders, or a community-based organization, and the petition for a charter school’s creation approved by an existing local public school district, a county board of education, or the State Board of Education.

A charter school is generally exempt from the laws governing school districts, except where specifically noted in the law. The Charter School Law acknowledges that among its intended purposes are: (i) to provide parents and students with expanded choices in the types of educational opportunities that are available within the public school system; (ii) to hold schools accountable for meeting measurable pupil outcomes and provide schools a way to shift from a rule-based to a performance-based system of accountability; and (iii) to provide competition within the public school system to stimulate improvements in all public schools.

# FINANCIAL INFORMATION

## Education Funding Generally

School districts in the State receive operating income primarily from two sources: the State funded portion which is derived from the State’s general fund, and a locally funded portion, being the district’s share of the one percent general ad valorem tax levy authorized by the California Constitution. As a result, decreases or deferrals in education funding by the State could significantly impact a school district’s revenues and operations.

The fiscal year 2013-14 State budget package replaced the previous K-12 finance system with a new formula known as the Local Control Funding Formula (the “LCFF”). Under the LCFF, school districts receive funding based on the demographic profile of the students they serve and gain greater flexibility to use these funds to improve outcomes of students. The LCFF creates funding targets based on student characteristics. For school districts and charter schools, the LCFF funding targets consist of grade span-specific base grants plus supplemental and concentration grants that reflect student demographic factors. The LCFF includes the following components:

- A base grant for each local education agency per unit of average daily attendance (“ADA”), which varies with respect to different grade spans and are adjusted upward each year to reflect cost-of-living increases. In addition, grades K-3 and 912 are subject to adjustments of 10.4% and 2.6%, respectively, to cover the costs of class size reduction in grades K-3 and the provision of career technical education in grades 9-12.

- A 20% supplemental grant for English learners, students from low-income families and foster youth to reflect increased costs associated with educating those students.

- An additional concentration grant of up to 65% (which was increased from 50% as part of the State’s trailer bill to the 2021-22 State Budget - Assembly Bill 130) of a local education agency’s base grant, based on the number of English learners, students from low-income families and foster youth served by the local agency that comprise more than 55% of enrollment.

- An economic recovery target to ensure that almost every local education agency receives at least their pre-recession funding level, adjusted for inflation, at full implementation of the LCFF.

The LCFF was implemented for fiscal year 2013-14 and was phased in gradually. Beginning in fiscal year 2013-14, an annual transition adjustment was required to be calculated for each school district, equal to each district’s proportionate share of the appropriations included in the State budget (based on the percentage of each district’s students who are low-income, English learners, and foster youth (“Targeted Students”)), to close the gap between the prior year funding level and the target allocation at full implementation of LCFF. In each year, districts had the same proportion of their respective funding gaps closed, with dollar amounts varying depending on the size of a district’s funding gap.

Funding levels used in the LCFF entitlement calculations for fiscal year 2023-24 are set forth in the following table.

**Entitlement Factor**  
| Grade Span | TK/K-3 | 4-6 | 7-8 | 9-12 |
|------------|--------|-----|-----|------|
| A. 2022-23 Base Grant per ADA | $9,166 | $9,304 | $9,580 | $11,102 |
| B. 2023-24 COLA for LCFF (A x 8.22%) | $753 | $765 | $787 | $913 |
| C. 2023-24 Base Grant per ADA before Grade Span Adjustments (A+B) | $9,919 | $10,069 | $10,367 | $12,015 |
| D. Grade Span Adjustments (TK-3: C x 10.4%; 9-12: C x 2.6%) | $1,032 | n/a | n/a | $312 |
| E. 2023-24 Base Grant/Adjusted Base Grant per ADA (C + D) | $10,951 | $10,069 | $10,367 | $12,327 |

*Add-ons to the Base Grant, as may be applicable, are: (1) Supplemental Grant: For the supplemental grant funding entitlement, for each grade span, the calculation is the base grant or adjusted base grant per ADA, times total funded ADA, times Unduplicated Pupil Percentage, times 20%. (2) Concentration Grant: For the concentration grant funding entitlement, the calculation is the base grant or adjusted base grant per ADA, times total funded ADA, times portion of Unduplicated Pupil Percentage that exceeds 55%, times 65%. (3) Transitional Kindergarten Add-On: For the TK add-on funding, the amount is the rate of $3,044 times the school district’s current year TK ADA.

The LCFF includes an accountability component. Districts are required to increase or improve services for English language learners, low income, and foster youth students in proportion to supplemental and concentration grant funding received. All school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools are required to develop and adopt local control and accountability plans, which identify local goals in areas that are priorities for the State, including pupil achievement, parent engagement, and school climate.

County superintendents review and provide support to the districts under their jurisdiction, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction performs a corresponding role for county offices of education. In addition, the State Budget for fiscal year 2013-14 created the California Collaborative for Education Excellence to advise and assist school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools in achieving the goals identified in their plans. Under the LCFF and related legislation, the State will continue to measure student achievement through statewide assessments, produce an Academic Performance Index for schools and subgroups of students, determine the contents of the school accountability report card, and establish policies to implement the federal accountability system. When a school district’s share of local property taxes exceeds its funding entitlement under LCFF, it is deemed a Basic Aid District and is entitled to keep its local property taxes in lieu of lower funding per ADA available under LCFF. The District is not a Basic Aid District.

**District Accounting Practices**  
The accounting practices of the District conform to generally accepted accounting principles in accordance with policies and procedures of the California School Accounting Manual. This manual, according to Section 41010 of the California Education Code, is to be followed by all California school districts. District accounting is organized on the basis of funds, with each group consisting of a separate accounting entity. The major fund classification is the general fund which accounts for all financial resources not requiring a special fund placement. The District's
<!-- Page 374 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. For more information on the District's basis of accounting and fund accounting, see Note 1 of APPENDIX B to the Official Statement.

District expenditures are accrued at the end of the fiscal year to reflect the receipt of goods and services in that year. Revenues generally are recorded on a cash basis, except for items that are susceptible to accrual (measurable and/or available to finance operations). Current taxes are considered susceptible to accrual. Revenues from specific state and federally funded projects are recognized when qualified expenditures have been incurred. State block grant apportionments are accrued to the extent that they are measurable and predictable. The State Department of Education sends the District updated information from time to time explaining the acceptable accounting treatment of revenue and expenditure categories.

The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”) published its Statement No. 34 “Basic Financial Statements – and Management’s Discussion and Analysis – for State and Local Governments” on June 30, 1999. Statement No. 34 provides guidelines to auditors, state and local governments and special purpose governments such as school districts and public utilities, on new requirements for financial reporting for all governmental agencies in the United States. Generally, the basic financial statements and required supplementary information should include (i) Management’s Discussion and Analysis; (ii) financial statements prepared using the economic measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, (iii) fund financial statements prepared using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual method of accounting and (iv) required supplementary information.

Financial Statements

General. The District's general fund finances the legally authorized activities of the District for which restricted funds are not provided. General fund revenues are derived from such sources as State school fund apportionments, taxes, use of money and property, and aid from other governmental agencies. The District's audited financial statements for fiscal year 2021-22 were prepared by Crowe LLP, Sacramento, California, and are attached to the Official Statement as APPENDIX B. Audited financial statements for the District for prior fiscal years are on file with the District and available for public inspection at the Office of the Chief Financial Officer. The District has not requested, and the auditor has not provided, any review or update of such financial statements in connection with inclusion in this Official Statement.

# District Budget and Interim Financial Reporting

## Budgeting and Interim Reporting Procedures
State law requires school districts to maintain a balanced budget in each fiscal year. The State Department of Education imposes a uniform budgeting and accounting format for school districts. Under current law, a school district governing board must adopt and file with the county superintendent of schools a tentative budget by July 1 in each fiscal year. The District is under the jurisdiction of the Sacramento County Superintendent of Schools (the "County Superintendent").

The County Superintendent must review and approve or disapprove the budget no later than August 15. The County Superintendent is required to examine the adopted budget for compliance with the standards and criteria adopted by the State Board of Education and identify technical corrections necessary to bring the budget into compliance with the established standards. If the budget is disapproved, it is returned to the District with recommendations for revision. The District is then required to revise the budget, hold a public hearing thereon, adopt the revised budget and file it with the County Superintendent no later than September 8. Pursuant to State law, the County Superintendent has available various remedies by which to impose and enforce a budget that complies with State criteria, depending on the circumstances, if a budget is disapproved. After approval of an adopted budget, the school district's administration may submit budget revisions for governing board approval.

Subsequent to approval, the County Superintendent will monitor each district under its jurisdiction throughout the fiscal year pursuant to its adopted budget to determine on an ongoing basis if the district can meet its current or subsequent year financial obligations. If the County Superintendent determines that a district will not meet its current or subsequent year obligations, the County Superintendent will notify the district's governing board of the determination and may then do either or both of the following: (a) assign a fiscal advisor to enable the district to meet those obligations or (b) if a study and recommendations are made and a district fails to take appropriate action to meet its financial obligations, the County Superintendent will so notify the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, and then may do any or all of the following for the remainder of the fiscal year: (i) request additional information regarding the district's budget and operations; (ii) after also consulting with the district's board, develop and impose revisions to the budget that will enable the district to meet its financial obligations; and (iii) stay or rescind any action inconsistent with such revisions. However, the County Superintendent may not abrogate any provision of a collective bargaining agreement that was entered into prior to the date upon which the County Superintendent assumed authority.

A State law adopted in 1991 ("A.B. 1200") imposed additional financial reporting requirements on school districts, and established guidelines for emergency State aid apportionments. Under the provisions of A.B. 1200, each school district is required to file interim certifications with the County Superintendent (on December 15, for the period ended October 31, and by mid-March for the period ended January 31) as to its ability to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the then-current fiscal year and, based on current forecasts, for the subsequent two fiscal years. The County Superintendent reviews the certification and issues either a positive, negative or qualified certification. A positive certification is assigned to any school district that will meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year and the subsequent two fiscal years. A negative certification is assigned to any school district that is deemed unable to meet its financial obligations for the remainder of the current fiscal year or the subsequent fiscal year. A qualified certification is assigned to any school district that may not meet its financial obligations for the current fiscal year or the two subsequent fiscal years.

A-8

<!-- Page 377 -->
Under California law, any school district and office of education that has a qualified or negative certification in any fiscal year may not issue, in that fiscal year or in the next succeeding fiscal year, certificates of participation, tax anticipation notes, revenue bonds or any other debt instruments that do not require the approval of the voters of the district, unless the applicable county superintendent of schools determines that the district’s repayment of indebtedness is probable.

**District’s Budget Approval/Disapproval and Certification History.** During the past five years, each of the District’s adopted budgets have been approved by the County Superintendent and the District has received positive certifications on all of its interim reports.

Copies of the District’s budget, interim reports and certifications may be obtained upon request from the District Office. The District may impose charges for copying, mailing and handling.

## District Reserves

The District's ending fund balance is the accumulation of surpluses from prior years. This fund balance is used to meet the State's minimum required reserve of 2% of expenditures, plus any other allocation or reserve which might be approved as an expenditure by the District in the future.

Under State law, there are certain restrictions on the amounts that can be held in reserve by school districts under certain circumstances. This reserve cap requirement does not apply to the District in the future.
<!-- Page 379 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

small school districts (ADA of fewer than 2,501 students) or school districts funded as Basic Aid school districts. When applicable, the reserve cap requires that a school district's adopted or revised budget not contain a combined assigned or unassigned ending general fund balance of more than 10% of those funds. The applicability of the reserve cap is based on the balance in the State’s Public School System Stabilization Account and is triggered in any fiscal year in which the balance is equal to or exceeds 3% of the combined total of general fund revenues appropriated for school districts. A county superintendent of schools may grant a school district under its jurisdiction an exemption from the requirements for up to two consecutive fiscal years within a three-year period, if the school district provides documentation indicating that extraordinary fiscal circumstances, including, but not limited to, multi-year infrastructure or technology projects, substantiate the need for a combined assigned or unassigned ending general fund balance that is in excess of the reserve cap. The reserve cap has been triggered for fiscal year 2023-24 and, as such, the cap must be taken into account in the budget process for school districts to which it applies, or an exemption must be sought. The District has taken into account the reserve cap as part of its budgeting process.

**Attendance - LCFF Funding**

**Funding Trends under LCFF.** As described herein, school districts receive base funding based on ADA, and may also be entitled to supplemental funding, concentration grants and funding based on an economic recovery target. The following table sets forth recent LCFF funding per ADA for the District for fiscal years 2017-18 through 2023-24.

**District's Unduplicated Student Count.** Under LCFF, school districts are entitled to supplemental funding based on the unduplicated count of targeted students. The District’s percentage of unduplicated students is approximately 41% for purposes of calculating supplemental and concentration grant funding under LCFF.

**Revenue Sources**

The District categorizes its general fund revenues into four sources, being LCFF, Federal Revenues, Other State Revenues and Local Revenues. Each of these revenue sources is described below.

**LCFF Sources.** District funding is provided by a mix of (1) local property taxes and (2) State apportionments of funding under the LCFF. Generally, the State apportionments will

A-11  
102
<!-- Page 380 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

amount to the difference between the District's LCFF funding entitlement and its local property tax revenues.

Beginning in 1978-79, Proposition 13 and its implementing legislation provided for each county to levy (except for levies to support prior voter-approved indebtedness) and collect all property taxes, and prescribed how levies on county-wide property values are to be shared with local taxing entities within each county.

The principal component of local revenues is the school district’s property tax revenues, i.e., the district’s share of the local 1% property tax, received pursuant to Sections 75 and following and Sections 95 and following of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. Education Code Section 42238(h) itemizes the local revenues that are counted towards the base revenue limit before calculating how much the State must provide in equalization aid. Historically, the more local property taxes a district received, the less State equalization aid it is entitled to.

Under LCFF, a school district whose property tax revenues exceed its funding under the LCFF is entitled to keep its local property tax revenues which exceed its LCFF funding, maintaining its status as a Basic Aid District, now referred to as a “Community Supported District.” For school districts that were Basic Aid prior to implementation of the LCFF, such districts are entitled to retain their status as Community Supported and keep their full local property tax revenue entitlement, provided that the per-pupil funding targets under LCFF, including economic recovery targets, are met or exceeded by local property tax revenues. The threshold for Community Supported status under the LCFF, however, is higher than under the prior funding formula, resulting in some districts falling out of Community Supported status and the loss of the imprimatur of the LCFF. The District is not a Community Supported District. Accountability measures contained in the LCFF must be implemented by all districts, including Community Supported Districts.

Federal Revenues. The federal government provides funding for several District programs, including special education programs, programs under Every Student Succeeds Act, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and specialized programs such as Drug Free Schools.

Other State Revenues. As discussed above, the District receives State apportionment funding entitlement and its property tax revenues. In addition to such apportionment revenue, the District receives other State revenues.

The District receives State aid from the California State Lottery (the “Lottery”), which was established by a constitutional amendment approved in the November 1984 general election. Lottery revenues must be used for the education of students and cannot be used for non-instructional purposes such as real property acquisition, facility construction, or the financing of research. Moreover, State Proposition 20 approved in March 2000 requires that 50% of the increase in Lottery revenues over 1997-98 levels must be restricted to use on instruction material. For additional discussion of State aid to school districts, see “- Education Funding Generally.”

Under AB 1469, the rate of 19.10% in effect as of July 1, 2020 was to continue unless modified by the STRS Board. However, the State legislature subsequently modified employer contribution rates in certain years as part of trailer bills adopted in connection with State budgets. Senate Bill 90 (“SB 90”) was enacted in connection with the fiscal year 2019-20 State budget, appropriating $2.25 billion to pay in advance part of the employer contributions for fiscal years 2019-20 and 2020-21. The effect was that the employer contribution rate effective July 1, 2019 was 17.10% and effective July 1, 2020 was 18.4%. However, in part in response to expected financial strain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the State’s 2020-21 budget redirected additional funds to reducing employer contribution rates, resulting in a rate of 16.15% in fiscal year 2020-21 and 16.92% in fiscal year 2021-22.

The employer contribution rate was 19.10% in fiscal year 2022-23 pursuant to AB 1469 and is 19.10% in fiscal year 2023-24. The State also continues to contribute to STRS, and its contribution rate in fiscal year 2022-23 was 8.328% and is 8.328% in fiscal year 2023-24.

The STRS defined benefit program continues to have an unfunded actuarial liability estimated at approximately $85.8 billion, based on a market value assets, as of June 30, 2022, which is the date of the last actuarial valuation.

**PERS.** All full-time and some part-time classified employees participate in PERS, an agent multiple-employer contributory public employee retirement system that acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating public entities within the State. PERS provides retirement, disability, and death benefits to plan members and beneficiaries. The District is part of a cost-sharing pool within PERS known as the “Schools Pool.” Benefit provisions are established by State statutes, as legislatively amended. Contributions to PERS are made by employers and employees. Each fiscal year, employers are required to contribute an amount based on an actuarially determined employer rate, and employees make contributions which vary based on their date of hire.

Like the STRS program, PERS has experienced an unfunded liability in recent years. To address this issue, the PERS board has taken a number of actions, including changes to the PERS amortization and smoothing policy intended to reduce volatility in employer contribution.

PERS continues to have an unfunded liability which, on a market value of assets basis, was approximately $37.6 billion, based on a market value of assets, as of June 30, 2022, which is the date of the last actuarial valuation.

**California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013.**  
On September 12, 2012, the Governor signed into law the California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (“PEPRA”), which impacted various aspects of public retirement systems in the State, including the STRS and PERS programs. In general, PEPRA (i) increased the retirement age for public employees depending on job function, (ii) capped the annual pension benefit payouts for public employees hired after January 1, 2013, (iii) required public employees hired after January 1, 2013 to pay at least 50% of the costs of their pension benefits (as described in more detail below), (iv) required final compensation for public employees hired after January 1, 2013 to be determined.
<!-- Page 384 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+not+displayed)

based on the highest average annual pensionable compensation earned over a period of at least 36 consecutive months, and (v) attempted to address other perceived abuses in the public retirement systems in the State. PEPRAs applies to all public employee retirement systems in the State, except the retirement systems of the University of California, and charter cities and charter counties whose pension plans are not governed by State law. PEPRAs provisions went into effect on January 1, 2013 with respect to new State, school, and city and local agency employees hired on or after that date; existing employees who are members of employee associations, including employee associations of the District, have a five-year window to negotiate compliance with PEPRAs through collective bargaining.

PERS has predicted that the impact of PEPRAs on employees and employers, including the District and other employers in the PERS system, will vary, based on each employer's current level of benefits. As a result of the implementation of PEPRAs, new members must pay at least 50% of the normal costs of the plan, which can fluctuate from year to year. To the extent that the new formulas lower retirement benefits, employer contribution rates could decrease over time as current employees retire and employees subject to the new formulas make up a larger percentage of the workforce. This change would, in some circumstances, result in a lower retirement benefit for employees than they currently earn.

With respect to the STRS pension program, employees hired after January 1, 2013 will pay the greater of either (1) fifty percent of the normal cost of their retirement plan, rounded to the nearest one-quarter percent, or (2) the contribution rate paid by then-current members (i.e., employees in the STRS plan as of January 1, 2013). The member contribution rate could be increased from this level through collective bargaining or may be adjusted based on other factors. Employers will pay at least the normal cost rate, subsidizing the member's contribution.

The District is unable to predict the amount of future contributions it will have to make to PERS and STRS as a result of the implementation of PEPRAs, and as a result of negotiations with its employee associations, or, notwithstanding the adoption of PEPRAs, resulting from any legislative changes regarding the PERS and STRS employer contributions that may be adopted in the future.

Additional Information - STRS and PERS. Additional information regarding the District’s retirement programs is available in Notes 8 and 9 to the District’s audited financial statements attached hereto as APPENDIX B. In addition, both STRS and PERS issue separate comprehensive financial reports that include financial statements and required supplemental information. Copies of such reports may be obtained from STRS and PERS, respectively, as follows: (i) STRS, P.O. Box 15275, Sacramento, California 95851-0275; and (ii) PERS, 400 Q Street, Sacramento, California 95811.

More information regarding STRS and PERS can also be obtained at their websites, www.calstrs.com and www.calpers.ca.gov, respectively. The references to these Internet websites are shown for reference and convenience only and the information contained on such websites is not incorporated by reference into this Official Statement. The information contained on these websites may not be current and has not been reviewed by the District or the Underwriters for accuracy or completeness.

Other Post-Employment Retirement Benefits

Plan Description. The District provides postemployment health care benefits (“OPEB”) (medical and dental) under a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan (the “Plan”) to all certificated, management and confidential employees who are eligible to retire from the District.  
A-16

and have completed a minimum of 5 years of employment with the District. The Plan does not issue separate financial statements. Health care benefits are provided for supervisory employees who are eligible to retire under a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan and have completed a minimum of 10 years of employment with the District. Health care benefits are provided to classified and transportation employees, who have reached the age of 55, are eligible to retire under a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan and have completed a minimum of 10 years of employment with the District. Health care benefits are provided to these employees until they have attained the age of 65. As of June 30, 2022 the District has not accumulated assets in a qualified trust for the purpose of paying the benefits related to the District’s Total OPEB Liability. The District Board has the authority to establish or amend the benefit terms offered by the Plan. The District Board also retains the authority to establish the requirements for paying the Plan benefits as they come due. At June 30, 2022, membership of the Plan consists of 527 retirees and 4,146 active employees.

**Benefits Provided.** The benefits provided are the same as those provided for active employees. Spouses and dependents of eligible retirees are also eligible for medical coverage. All salaried employees of the District are eligible to receive postemployment health care benefits. Hourly employees (i.e. non-salaried with variable work hours) are not eligible to receive OPEB.

**Contributions.** California Government Code specifies that the District's contribution requirements for covered employees are established and may be amended by the Board. Retirees participating in the group insurance plans offered by the District are required to contribute 100% of the active premiums. In future years, contributions are assumed to increase at the same rate as premiums. The District's premium rates being charged to these retirees are lower than the expected cost for a retiree population under age 65. Thus, an implicit subsidy exists as a result of this difference between the actual cost and the true retiree cost. Contributions to the Plan from the District were $7,016,728 for the year ended June 30, 2022. Employees are not required to contribute to the OPEB plan.

**Actuarial Assumptions and Other Inputs.** The District’s total OPEB liability of $145,937,052 was measured as of June 30, 2021, and was determined by an actuarial valuation as of the same date. The total OPEB liability in the June 30, 2021 actuarial valuation was determined using the following assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement, unless otherwise specified: inflation 2.50% per year, salary increases 3.00% per year, and healthcare cost trend rates 5.00%–7.00% per year. The mortality rate is based on the CalPERS 2017 Experience Study. The retirement rates match rates developed in the most recent experience studies for CalPERS (2017) and CalSTRS (2020).

**Discount Rate.** The discount rate of 1.92% was based on the Fidelity 20 Year AA Municipal Bond maturity yield index.

Changes of assumptions reflect a change in discount rate from 2.45% in the prior valuation, to 1.92% in the current valuation.

**OPEB Expense.** For the year ended June 30, 2022, the District recognized an OPEB expense of $11,043,782. For more information regarding the District’s OPEB and assumptions used in its most recent actuarial study, see Note 10 of APPENDIX B to the Official Statement.

**Insurance – Joint Powers Agreement**

The District is a member with other school districts of a joint powers authority, Schools Insurance Authority (“SIA”), Education Technology Joint Powers Authority, Sourcewell Staples Minnesota, and School Project for Utility Rate Reduction for the operation of a common risk management and insurance program for property and liability coverage. The Joint Powers Agreement (“JPA”) with SIA provides that SIA will be self-sustaining through member premiums and will reinsure through commercial companies for claims in excess of $100,000 and $750,000 for each insured event for property and liability, respectively. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded commercial insurance coverage in any of the past three fiscal years. There have been no significant reductions in insurance coverage in the prior year.

For more information regarding the District’s JPAs, see Note 10 of Appendix B to the Official Statement.

The County is required to invest such funds in accordance with California Government Code Sections 53601 et seq. in addition, counties are required to establish their own investment policies which may impose limitations beyond those required by the California Government Code. See APPENDIX G to the Official Statement for the County's current investment policy and recent investment report.

**Effect of State Budget on Revenues**

Public school districts in California are dependent on revenues from the State for a large portion of their operating budgets. California school districts generally receive the majority of their operating revenues from various State sources. The primary source of funding for school districts is LCFF funding, which is derived from a combination of State funds and local property taxes (see “—Education Funding Generally” above). State funds typically make up the majority of a district’s LCFF funding. School districts also receive funding from the State for some specialized programs such as special education.

The availability of State funds for public education is a function of constitutional provisions affecting school district revenues and expenditures (see “CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS” below), the condition of the State economy (which affects total revenue available to the State general fund), and the annual State budget process. The District cannot predict how education funding may

STATE FUNDING OF EDUCATION; RECENT STATE BUDGETS

The information in this section concerning the State’s budget or budgets has been compiled from publicly-available information provided by the State or the Legislative Analyst’s Office (the “LAO”). Neither the District, the Underwriters nor the County is responsible for the information provided in this section.

State Funding of Education Generally

The State requires that from all State revenues there first shall be set apart the moneys to be applied for support of the public school system and public institutions of higher education. Public school districts in California are dependent on revenues from the State for a large portion of their operating budgets. The primary source of funding for school districts are revenues under the LCFF, which are a combination of State funds and local property taxes (see “FINANCIAL INFORMATION - Education Funding Generally” above). State funds typically make up the majority of a district’s LCFF allocation, although Basic Aid school districts derive the majority of their revenues from local property taxes. School districts also receive substantial funding from the State for various categorical programs.

The availability of State funds for public education is a function of constitutional provisions affecting school district revenues and expenditures (see “CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS” below), the condition of the State economy (which affects total revenue available to the State’s general fund), and the annual State budget process. Decreases in State revenues may significantly affect appropriations made by the legislature to school districts.

The State Budget Process

The State’s fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. The annual budget is proposed by the Governor by January 10 of each year for the next fiscal year. Under State law, the annual proposed State budget cannot provide for projected expenditures in excess of projected revenues and balances available from prior fiscal years. Following the submission of the State budget, the Legislature takes up the proposal.

Under the State Constitution, money may be drawn from the State Treasury only through an appropriation made by law. The primary source of the annual expenditure authorizations is the Budget Act as approved by the Legislature and signed by the Governor. The Budget Act must be approved by a majority vote of each house of the Legislature. The Governor may reduce or eliminate specific line items in the Budget Act or any other appropriations bill without vetoing the entire bill. Such individual line-item vetoes are subject to override by a two-thirds majority vote of each house of the Legislature.

Appropriations also may be included in legislation other than the Budget Act. Bills containing appropriations (including for K-14 education) must be approved by a majority vote in each house of the Legislature, unless such appropriations require tax increases, in which case they must be approved by a two-thirds vote of each house of the Legislature and be signed by each house of the Legislature.

**The 2023-24 State Budget**  
On June 27, 2023, the Governor signed the State’s fiscal year 2023-24 State budget bill (the “2023-24 State Budget”), prior to the July 1, 2023, deadline. The 2023-24 State Budget spending plan totals $310 billion and solves a $31.5 billion deficit problem, which is largely the result of falling State revenues in recent months due to a downturn in the stock market and resulting decreased capital gains, a volatile and significant source of State revenues. The 2023-24 State Budget maintains the largest-ever reserves aimed at weathering projected deficits in out-years, as well as a potential economic recession in the coming one or two years.  

The 2023-24 State Budget marked a change from several previous years of record surpluses, large ongoing program commitments, and major one-time expenditures for projects. Adding to uncertainties in budgeting was the delayed income tax return filing date due to federal and State winter storm disaster declarations. As a result, actual revenues in the 2023-24 State Budget will not be solidified until October 15, 2023, and further adjustments may be necessary if revenues continue to underperform projections.  

The 2023-24 State Budget deficit was addressed with a combination of spending reductions totaling $8 billion, including a planned $750 million payment to the federal government to reduce the State’s $20 billion unemployment insurance debt and approximately $4 billion in funding previously earmarked for climate change and zero-emission programs, delayed spending of nearly $8 billion previously approved for coming years, including funding for building facilities for transitional and full-day kindergarten, postponement in the spending.

![State Budget Highlights](https://example.com/image.png)

of $500 million in broadband expansion funding, and more than $15 billion in revised revenue estimates, internal fund shifts and internal borrowing.

Highlights of the 2023-24 State Budget include:

**Public Education:** Continued full funding for public K–14 education, which will see an 8.4% increase in state funding, and keep commitments to previously authorized spending increases for the University of California and California State University.

**Health Care:** Continued funding for other previous multi-year health care commitments, including (a) increases to fund California’s universal access to affordable health care, such as the state’s Medi-Cal eligibility expansion for undocumented adults and significant reforms under the Governor’s California Advancing and Innovating Medi-Cal, and (b) agreement to place a bond measure on the March 2024 ballot, asking voters to increase bond funding for more behavioral health beds and transitional housing aimed at reducing the incidence of homelessness.

**Managed Care Organization Tax:** Implements allocations of available funds from the renewal of the Managed Care Organization tax to provide $2.7 billion in State funds for reimbursement rate increases and other investments annually, beginning in 2025 and going through 2029.

**Climate Change:** A reduction in $2.9 billion from the previous commitment of more than $6 billion toward battling climate change.

**Housing and Homelessness:** $1 billion for local homeless programs, and direction of $100 million to the Housing and Community Development Department’s flagship Multi-Family Housing Program for developing additional affordable housing and leveraging additional public and private investment dollars. Invests $50 million in the Fresno Public Infrastructure Plan designed to revitalize downtown Fresno and lay the groundwork for infill housing development through transportation, water and green space public works projects.

**Public Transit:** $5.1 billion for transit across four years, with flexibility for capital and operations expenses and accountability provisions.

Funding for Proposition 98 is $108.3 billion in the 2023-24 State Budget, which is $2.1 billion less than the in the State budget for fiscal year 2022-23. An 8.2% cost-of-living adjustment will raise the funding formula, which is the primary funding source for general expenses and additional money for high-needs students, by 4.5% to $79 billion. The additional funding takes into account a projected 3.16% decline statewide in ADA, including fewer students than projected enrolling in traditional kindergarten.

Other additional spending in the education portion of the 2023-24 State Budget includes:

- $300 million to the funding formula to create an “equity multiplier” program, meant to enable certain high-needs schools to close opportunity and achievement gaps by addressing learning needs for the lowest-performing racial and ethnic student groups, students with disabilities and English learners in those schools.

- $250 million in one-time funding to double grants over five years to high-poverty schools to train and hire literacy coaches for one-on-one and small-group interventions for struggling readers.

- $80 million in ongoing funding for juvenile court and alternative schools operated by county offices of education.

- $20 million in professional development grants for bilingual teachers.

- $6 million more to the Golden State Teacher Grant program, which offers up to $20,000 to a teacher candidate who commits to working in a priority school for four years, for teacher candidates preparing to become special education teachers.

- $3.5 million ongoing to county offices of education to stock opioid overdose reversal medication, with at least two units at all middle and high schools within each county office’s jurisdiction.

- $1 million to develop a state “literacy roadmap” to provide guidance on teaching, training and using evidence-based practices on effective reading instruction.

- $1 million for a panel to identify a choice of screening instruments from which all schools must choose, starting in the 2025-26 school year, to identify students at risk for dyslexia and other reading difficulties.

- $1 million for professional development and leadership training through the Museum of Tolerance.

Several trailer bills implementing the provisions of the 2023-24 State Budget are expected to be considered and voted upon in the coming weeks.

**Disclaimer Regarding State Budgets**

The execution of State budgets may be affected by numerous factors, including but not limited to: (i) shifts in costs from the federal government to the State, (ii) national, State and international economic conditions, (iii) litigation risks, (iv) rising health care costs and/or other unfunded liabilities, such as pension or OPEB, and (v) numerous other factors, all or any of which could cause the revenue and spending projections included in such budgets to be unattainable. The District cannot predict the impact that the 2023-24 State Budget or subsequent State budgets, or future changes (if any) in the budget due to shifts in the economy or other factors, will have on its own finances and operations. However, the Bonds described herein are secured by ad valorem property taxes levied and collected on taxable property in the District, without limit as to rate or amount, and are not secured by a pledge of revenues of the District or its general fund.

The State has not entered into any contractual commitments with the District, the County, the Underwriters or the owners of the Bonds to provide State Budget information to the District or the owners of the Bonds. Although the sources of information provided herein are known to be reliable, neither the District nor the Underwriters assume any responsibility for the accuracy of the budget information set forth or referred to in this Official Statement or incorporated herein.

**Legal Challenges to State Funding of Education**

The application of Proposition 98 and other statutory provisions relating to education funding in the State has been the subject of various legal challenges in the past. The District cannot predict if or when there will be changes to education funding or legal challenges which may arise relating thereto, and how such events could impact the District and its finances.

**CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVISIONS AFFECTING DISTRICT REVENUES AND APPROPRIATIONS**

Principal of and interest on the Bonds are payable from the proceeds of an ad valorem tax levied by the County for the payment thereof. Articles XIII A, XIII B, XIII C, and XIII D of the State Constitution, Propositions 62, 98, 111 and 218, and certain other provisions of law discussed below, are included in this section to describe the potential effect of these Constitutional and statutory measures on the ability of the District to levy taxes and spend tax proceeds for operating and other purposes, and it should not be inferred from the inclusion of such materials that these laws impose any limitation on the ability of the District to levy taxes for payment of the Bonds. The tax levied by the County for payment of the bonds was approved by the District's voters in compliance with Article XIII A and all applicable laws.

**Constitutionally Required Funding of Education**

The State Constitution requires that from all State revenues, there shall be first set apart the moneys to be applied by the State for the support of the public school system and public institutions of higher education. School districts receive a significant portion of their funding from State appropriations. As a result, decreases and increases in State revenues can significantly affect appropriations made by the State Legislature to school districts.

**Article XIII A of the California Constitution**

**Basic Property Tax Levy.** On June 6, 1978, California voters approved Proposition 13 (“Proposition 13”), which added Article XIII A to the State Constitution (“Article XIII A”). Article XIII A limits the amount of any ad valorem tax on real property to 1% of the full cash value thereof, except that additional ad valorem taxes may be levied to pay debt service on (i) indebtedness approved by the voters prior to July 1, 1978, (ii) (as a result of an amendment to Article XIII A approved by State voters on June 3, 1986) bonded indebtedness for the acquisition or improvement of real property which has been approved on or after July 1, 1978 by two-thirds of the voters on such indebtedness, and (iii) (as a result of an amendment to Article XIII A approved by State voters on November 7, 2000) bonded indebtedness incurred by a school district or community college district for the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation or replacement of school facilities or the acquisition or lease of real property for school facilities, approved by 55% of the voters of the district, but only if certain accountability measures are included in the proposition. The tax for the payment of the Bonds falls within the exception described in (iii) of the immediately preceding sentence. Article XIII A defines full cash value to mean “the county 

A-25 116

assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975-76 tax bill under full cash value, or thereafter, the appraised value of real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership have occurred after the 1975 assessment”. This full cash value may be increased at a rate not to exceed 2% per year to account for inflation.

Article XIII A has subsequently been amended to permit reduction of the “full cash value” base in the event of declining property values caused by damage, destruction or other factors, to provide that there would be no increase in the “full cash value” base in the event of reconstruction of property damaged or destroyed in a disaster and in other minor or technical ways.

Both the United States Supreme Court and the California State Supreme Court have upheld the general validity of Article XIII A.

Legislation Implementing Article XIII A. Legislation has been enacted and amended a number of times since 1978 to implement Article XIII A. Under current law, local agencies are no longer permitted to levy directly any property tax (except to pay voter-approved indebtedness). The 1% property tax is automatically levied by the county and distributed according to a formula among taxing agencies. The formula apportions the tax roughly in proportion to the relative shares of taxes levied prior to 1979.

Increases of assessed valuation resulting from reappraisals of property due to new construction, change in ownership or from the annual adjustment not to exceed 2% are allocated among the various jurisdictions in the “taxing area” based upon their respective “situs.” Any such allocation made to a local agency continues as part of its allocation in future years.

Inflationary Adjustment of Assessed Valuation. As described above, the assessed value of a property may be increased at a rate not to exceed 2% per year to account for inflation. On December 27, 2001, the Orange County Superior Court, in County of Orange v. Orange County Assessment Appeals Board No. 3, held that where a home’s taxable value did not increase for two years, due to a flat real estate market, the Orange County assessor violated the 2% inflation adjustment provision of Article XIII A, when the assessor tried to “recapture” the tax value of the property by increasing its assessed value by 4% in a single year. The assessors in most California counties, including the County, use a similar methodology in raising the taxable values of property beyond 2% in a single year. The SBE has approved this methodology for increasing assessed values. On appeal, the Appellate Court held that the trial court erred in ruling that assessments are always limited to no more than 2% of the previous year’s assessment. On May 10, 2004 a petition for review was filed with the California Supreme Court. The petition has been denied by the California Supreme Court. As a result of this litigation, the “recapture” provision described above may continue to be employed in determining the full cash value of property for property tax purposes.

Article XIII B of the California Constitution

Article XIII B (“Article XIII B”) of the State Constitution, as subsequently amended by Propositions 98 and 111, respectively, limits the annual appropriations of the State and of any city, county, school district, authority or other political subdivision of the State to the level of appropriations of the particular governmental entity for the prior fiscal year, as adjusted for changes in the cost of living and in population and for transfers in the financial responsibility for providing services and for certain declared emergencies. For fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 1990, the appropriations limit of each entity of government shall be the appropriations limit for the 1986-87 fiscal year adjusted for the changes made from that fiscal year under the provisions of Article XIII B, as amended.

school districts from levying general taxes, and prohibits any local agency from imposing, extending or increasing any special tax beyond its maximum authorized rate without a two-thirds vote; and also provides that the initiative power will not be limited in matters of reducing or repealing local taxes, assessments, fees and charges. Article XIII C further provides that no tax may be assessed on property other than ad valorem property taxes imposed in accordance with Articles XIII and XIII A of the California Constitution and special taxes approved by a two-thirds vote under Article XIII A, Section 4.

On November 2, 2010, Proposition 26 was approved by State voters, which amended Article XIII C to expand the definition of “tax” to include “any levy, charge, or exaction of any kind imposed by a local government” except the following: (1) a charge imposed for a specific benefit conferred or privilege granted directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of conferring the benefit or granting the privilege; (2) a charge imposed for a specific government service or product provided directly to the payor that is not provided to those not charged, and which does not exceed the reasonable costs to the local government of providing the service or product; (3) a charge imposed for the reasonable regulatory costs to a local government for issuing licenses and permits, performing investigations, inspections, and audits, enforcing agricultural marketing orders, and the administrative enforcement and adjudication thereof; (4) a charge imposed for entrance to or use of local government property, or the purchase, rental, or lease of local government property; (5) a fine, penalty, or other monetary charge imposed by the judicial branch of government or a local government, as a result of a violation of law; (6) a charge imposed as a condition of property development; and (7) assessments and property-related fees imposed in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII D. Proposition 26 provides that the local government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a levy, charge, or

fiscal year, adjusted for increases in enrollment and changes in the cost of living. The Accountability Act permits the Legislature to suspend this formula for a one-year period.

The Accountability Act also changes how tax revenues in excess of the State appropriations limit are distributed. Any excess State tax revenues up to a specified amount would, instead of being returned to taxpayers, be transferred to K-14 school districts. Any such transfer to K-14 school districts would be excluded from the appropriations limit for K-14 school districts and the K-14 school district appropriations limit for the next year would automatically be increased by the amount of such transfer. These additional moneys would enter the base funding calculation for K-14 school districts for subsequent years, creating further pressure on other portions of the State budget, particularly if revenues decline in a year following an Article XIIIB surplus. The maximum amount of excess tax revenues which could be transferred to K-14 school districts is 4% of the minimum State spending for education mandated by the Accountability Act.

**Proposition 111**

On June 5, 1990, the voters approved Proposition 111 (Senate Constitutional Amendment No. 1) called the “Traffic Congestion Relief and Spending Limit Act of 1990” (“Proposition 111”) which further modified Article XIIIB and Sections 8 and 8.5 of Article XVI of the State Constitution with respect to appropriations limitations and school funding priority and allocation.

The most significant provisions of Proposition 111 are summarized as follows:

**Annual Adjustments to Spending Limit.** The annual adjustments to the Article XIIIB spending limit are now determined to be more closely linked to the rate of economic growth. Instead of being tied to the Consumer Price Index, the “change in the cost of living” is now measured by the change in California per capita personal income. The definition of “change in population” specifies that a portion of the State’s spending limit is to be adjusted to reflect changes in school attendance.

**Treatment of Excess Tax Revenues.** “Excess” tax revenues with respect to Article XIIIB are now determined based on a two-year cycle, so that the State can avoid having to return to taxpayers excess tax revenues in one year if its appropriations in the next fiscal year are under its limit. In addition, the Proposition 98 provision regarding excess tax revenues was modified. After any two-year period, if there are excess State tax revenues, 50% of the excess are to be transferred to K-14 school districts with the balance returned to taxpayers; under prior law, 100% of excess State tax revenues went to K-14 school districts, but only up to a maximum of 4% of the schools’ minimum funding level. Also, reversing prior law, any excess State tax revenues transferred to K-14 school districts are not built into the school districts’ base expenditures for calculating their entitlement for State aid in the next year, and the State’s appropriations limit is not to be increased by this amount.

**Exclusions from Spending Limit.** Two exceptions were added to the calculation of appropriations which are subject to the Article XIIIB spending limit. First, there are excluded all appropriations for “qualified capital outlay projects” as defined by the Legislature. Second, there are excluded any increases in gasoline taxes above the 1990 level (then nine cents per gallon), sales and use taxes on such increment in gasoline taxes, and increases in receipts from vehicle weight fees above the levels in effect on January 1, 1990. These latter provisions were necessary to make effective the transportation funding package approved by the Legislature and the Governor, which expected to raise over $15 billion in additional taxes from 1990 through 2000 to fund transportation programs.

![Proposition 1A and Proposition 22](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Proposition+1A+and+Proposition+22)

**Proposition 1A and Proposition 22**

On November 2, 2004, California voters approved Proposition 1A, which amended the State constitution to significantly reduce the State's authority over major local government revenue sources. Under Proposition 1A, the State cannot (i) reduce local sales tax rates or alter the method of allocating the revenue generated by such taxes, (ii) shift property taxes from local governments to schools or community colleges, (iii) change how property tax revenues are shared among local governments without two-thirds approval of both houses of the State Legislature or (iv) decrease Vehicle License Fee revenues without providing local governments with equal replacement funding. Under Proposition 1A, beginning in 2008-09, the State may shift to schools and community colleges a limited amount of local government property tax revenue if certain conditions are met, including: (i) a proclamation by the Governor that the shift is needed due to a severe financial hardship of the State, and (ii) approval of the shift by the State Legislature with a two-thirds vote of both houses. Under such a shift, the State must repay local governments for their property tax losses, with interest, within three years. Proposition 1A does allow the State to approve voluntary exchanges of local sales tax and property tax revenues among local governments within a county. Proposition 1A also amended the State Constitution to require the State to suspend certain State laws creating mandates in any year that the State does not fully reimburse local governments for their costs to comply with the mandates. This provision does not apply to mandates relating to schools or community colleges or to those mandates relating to employee rights.

Proposition 22, a constitutional initiative entitled the “Local Taxpayer, Public Safety, and Transportation Protection Act of 2010,” approved on November 2, 2010, superseded many of the provisions of Proposition 1A. This initiative amends the State Constitution to prohibit the legislature from diverting or shifting revenues that are dedicated to funding services provided by local government or funds dedicated to transportation improvement projects and services. Under this proposition, the State is not allowed to take revenue derived from locally imposed taxes, such as hotel taxes, parcel taxes, utility taxes and sales taxes, and local public transit and transportation funds. Further, in the event that a local governmental agency sues the State alleging a violation of these provisions and wins, then the State must automatically appropriate the funds needed to pay that local government. This Proposition was intended to, among other things, stabilize local government revenue sources by restricting the State’s control over local property taxes. Proposition 22 did not prevent the California State Legislature from dissolving state redevelopment agencies pursuant to AB 1X26, as confirmed by the decision of the California Supreme Court decision in *California Redevelopment Association v. Matosantos* (2011).

Because Proposition 22 reduces the State’s authority to use or reallocate certain revenue sources, fees and taxes for State general fund purposes, the State will have to take other actions to balance its budget, such as reducing State spending or increasing State taxes, and school and college districts that receive Proposition 98 or other funding from the State will be more directly dependent upon the State’s general fund.

**Proposition 30 and Proposition 55**

The Guaranteed Local Public Safety Funding, Initiative Constitutional Amendment (also known as “Proposition 30”), temporarily increased the State Sales and Use Tax and personal income tax rates on higher incomes. Proposition 30 temporarily imposed an additional tax on all retailers, at the rate of 0.25% of gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property sold in the State from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. Proposition 30 also imposed an additional excise tax on the storage, use, or other consumption in the State of tangible personal property purchased from a retailer on and after January 1, 2013 and before January 1, 2017. This. 

A-31 122
<!-- Page 400 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

excise tax was levied at a rate of 0.25% of the sales price of the property so purchased. For personal income taxes imposed beginning in the taxable year commencing January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2018, Proposition 30 increases the marginal personal income tax rate by: (i) 1% for taxable income over $250,000 but less than $300,000 for single filers (over $500,000 but less than $600,000 for joint filers), (ii) 2% for taxable income over $300,000 but less than $500,000 for single filers (over $600,000 but less than $1,000,000 for joint filers), and (iii) 3% for taxable income over $500,000 for single filers (over $1,000,000 for joint filers).

The revenues generated from the temporary tax increases will be included in the calculation of the Proposition 98 minimum funding guarantee for school districts and community college districts. See “Proposition 98” and “Proposition 111” above. From an accounting perspective, the revenues generated from the temporary tax increases will be deposited into the State account created pursuant to Proposition 30 called the Education Protection Account (the “EPA”). Pursuant to Proposition 30, funds in the EPA will be allocated quarterly, with 89% of such funds provided to school districts and 11% provided to community college districts. The funds will be distributed to school districts and community college districts in the same manner as existing unrestricted per-student funding, except that no school district will receive less than $200 per unit of ADA and no community college district will receive less than $100 per full time equivalent student. The governing board of each school district and community college district is granted sole authority to determine how the moneys received from the EPA are spent, provided that, the appropriate governing board is required to make these spending determinations in open session at a public meeting and such local governing boards are prohibited from using any funds from the EPA for salaries or benefits of administrators or any other administrative costs.

The California Children’s Education and Health Care Protection Act of 2016, also known as Proposition 55, was a proposed constitutional amendment initiative that was approved on the November 8, 2016, general election ballot in California. Proposition 55 extends the increases to personal income tax rates for high-income taxpayers that were approved as part of Proposition 30 through 2030, instead of the scheduled expiration date of December 31, 2018. Tax revenue received under Proposition 55 is to be allocated 89% to K-12 schools and 11% to community colleges. Proposition 55 did not extend the sales tax increases of Proposition 30.

California Senate Bill 222  
Senate Bill 222 (“SB 222”) amended Section 15251 of the California Education Code and added Section 52515 to the California Government Code to provide that voter-approved general obligation bonds which are secured by ad valorem tax collections such as the Bonds are secured by a statutory lien on all revenues received pursuant to the levy and collection of the property tax imposed to service those bonds. Said lien shall attach automatically and is valid and binding from the time the bonds are executed and delivered, enforceable against the issuer, its successors, transferees, and creditors, and all others asserting rights therein, irrespective of whether those parties have notice of the lien and without the need for any further act. The effect is the treatment of general obligation bonds as secured debt in bankruptcy due to the existence of a statutory lien.

Future Initiatives  
Article XIIIA, Article XIII B, Article XIII C and Article XIII D of the California Constitution and Propositions 98, 111, 22, 26, 30, 39 and 55 were each adopted as measures that qualified for the ballot under the State’s initiative process. From time to time other initiative measures could be adopted further affecting District revenues or the District’s ability to expend revenues. The nature and impact of these measures cannot be anticipated by the District.

## ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ABOUT SACRAMENTO COUNTY

The Bonds are not a debt of Sacramento County (the “County”). The County, including its Board of Supervisors, officers, officials, agents and other employees, are required, only to the extent required by law, to: (i) levy and collect ad valorem taxes for payment of the Bonds in accordance with the law; and (ii) transmit the proceeds of such taxes to the paying agent for the payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds at the time such payment is due.

### General Information

The County. The County was incorporated in 1850 as one of the original 27 counties of the State of California (the “State”). The County's largest city, the City of Sacramento serves as the seat of government for both the County and the State. Sacramento became the State Capital in 1854. The County is the major component of the Sacramento -Roseville -Arden -Arcade Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”), which includes Sacramento, El Dorado, and Placer and Yolo Counties.

The County encompasses approximately 994 square miles in the northern portion of the Central Valley, which is California’s prime agricultural region. The County is bordered by Contra Costa and San Joaquin Counties on the south, Amador and El Dorado Counties on the east, Placer and Sutter Counties on the north, and Yolo and Solano Counties on the west. The County extends from the low delta lands between the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers north to about ten miles beyond the State Capitol and east to the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The southernmost portion of the County has direct access to the San Francisco Bay.

# Effective Buying Income

“Effective Buying Income” is defined as personal income less personal tax and nontax payments, a number often referred to as “disposable” or “after-tax” income. Personal income is the aggregate of wages and salaries, other labor-related income (such as employer contributions to private pension funds), proprietor’s income, rental income (which includes imputed rental income of owner-occupants of non-farm dwellings), dividends paid by corporations, interest income from all sources, and transfer payments (such as pensions and welfare assistance). Deducted from this total are personal taxes (federal, state and local), nontax payments (fines, fees, penalties, etc.) and personal contributions to social insurance. According to U.S. government definitions, the resultant figure is commonly known as "disposable personal income."

The following table summarizes the median household effective buying income for the County, the State and the United States for the period 2020 through 2024.

## PROPOSED FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL

[LETTERHEAD OF JONES HALL]

[Closing Date]

Board of Education  
San Juan Unified School District  
3738 Walnut Avenue  
Carmichael, California 95609  

**OPINION:** $________ San Juan Unified School District (Sacramento County, California) General Obligation Bonds, Election of 2016, Series 2024  

Members of the Board of Education:

We have acted as bond counsel to the San Juan Unified School District (the “District”) in connection with the issuance by the District of $________ principal amount of San Juan Unified School District (Sacramento County, California) General Obligation Bonds, Election of 2016, Series 2024, dated the date hereof (the “Bonds”), under the provisions of Article 4.5 of Chapter 3 of Part 1 of Division 2 of Title 5 of the California Government Code, and a resolution adopted by the Board of Education of the District (the “Board”) on November 14, 2023 (the “Bond Resolution”). We have examined the law and such certified proceedings and other papers as we deemed necessary to render this opinion.

As to questions of fact material to our opinion, we have relied upon representations of the Board contained in the Bond Resolution and in the certified proceedings and certifications of public officials and others furnished to us, without undertaking to verify the same by independent investigation.

Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion, under existing law, as follows:

1. The District is duly established and validly existing as a unified school district with the power to issue the Bonds and to perform its obligations under the Bond Resolution.

2. The Bond Resolution has been duly adopted by the Board and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the District enforceable against the District in accordance with its terms.

3. The Bonds have been duly issued and sold by the District and are valid and binding general obligations of the District, and the Board of Supervisors of the County of Sacramento is  

D-1  
131  
<!-- Page 409 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

obligated to levy ad valorem taxes for the payment of the Bonds and the interest thereon upon all property within the District subject to taxation by the District, without limitation as to rate or amount.

4. The interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and is not an item of tax preference for purposes of the federal alternative minimum tax. Interest on the Bonds may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. The opinions set forth in the preceding sentences are subject to the condition that the District comply with all requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, relating to the exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds. The District has made certain representations and covenants in order to comply with each such requirement. Inaccuracy of those representations, or failure to comply with certain of those covenants, may cause the inclusion of such interest in gross income for federal income tax purposes, which may be retroactive to the date of issuance of the Bonds.

5. The interest on the Bonds is exempt from personal income taxation imposed by the State of California.

We express no opinion regarding any other tax consequences arising with respect to the ownership, sale or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds.

The rights of the owners of the Bonds and the enforceability of the Bonds are limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally, and by equitable principles, whether considered at law or in equity.

This opinion is given as of the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to revise or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or circumstances that may hereafter come to our attention, or any changes in law that may hereafter occur.

Respectfully submitted,

A Professional Law Corporation

## DTC AND THE BOOK-ENTRY ONLY SYSTEM

The following description of the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), the procedures and record keeping with respect to beneficial ownership interests in the Bonds, payment of principal, interest and other payments on the Bonds to DTC Participants or Beneficial Owners, confirmation and transfer of beneficial ownership interest in the Bonds and other related transactions by and between DTC, the DTC Participants and the Beneficial Owners is based solely on information provided by DTC. Accordingly, no representations can be made concerning these matters and neither the DTC Participants nor the Beneficial Owners should rely on the foregoing information with respect to such matters, but should instead confirm the same with DTC or the DTC Participants, as the case may be.

Neither the District nor the Paying Agent take any responsibility for the information contained in this Section.

No assurances can be given that DTC, DTC Participants or Indirect Participants will distribute to the Beneficial Owners (a) payments of interest, principal or premium, if any, with respect to the Bonds, (b) Bonds representing ownership interest in or other confirmation or ownership interest in the Bonds, or (c) redemption or other notices sent to DTC or Cede & Co., its nominee, as the registered owner of the Bonds, or that they will so do on a timely basis, or that DTC, DTC Participants or DTC Indirect Participants will act in the manner described in this Appendix. The current "Rules" applicable to DTC are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the current "Procedures" of DTC to be followed in dealing with DTC Participants are on file with DTC.

1. The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the securities (in this Appendix, the “Bonds”). The Bonds will be issued as fully-registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC’s partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Bond will be issued for each maturity of the Bonds, in the aggregate principal amount of such maturity, and will be deposited with DTC. If, however, the aggregate principal amount of any maturity exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such issue.

2. DTC, the world’s largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned

F-2

subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard & Poor’s rating of AA+. The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. The information contained on this Internet site is not incorporated herein by reference.

3. Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive Bonds representing their ownership interests in Bonds, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.

4. To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede & Co. and may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Bonds with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

5. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to take certain steps to augment transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Bonds, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Bond documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Bonds for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of the notices be provided directly to them.

6. Redemption notices will be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds within an issue are being redeemed, DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such issue to be redeemed.

7. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to District as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede & Co.’s consenting or voting
<!-- Page 419 -->

8. Redemption proceeds, distributions, and interest payments on the Bonds will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts, upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from District or Paying Agent on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC nor its nominee, Paying Agent, or District, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of District or Paying Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.

9. DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Bonds at any time by giving reasonable notice to District or Paying Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor securities depository is not obtained, Bonds are required to be printed and delivered to DTC.

11. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that District believes to be reliable, but District takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

ARTICLE II

THE REFUNDING BONDS

SECTION 2.01. Authorization. (a) General.

To that end, the Board hereby authorizes the issuance of the Refunding Bonds, in one or more series, on a tax-exempt or taxable basis as shall be determined by a District Representative, in the aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $120,000,000, subject to the terms of the Bond Law and this Resolution, for the purpose of providing funds to refinance certain maturities of the Prior Bonds. This Resolution constitutes a continuing agreement between the District and the Owners of all the Outstanding Refunding Bonds to secure the full and final payment of principal of and interest and premium, if any, on the Refunding Bonds, subject to the covenants, agreements, provisions and conditions herein contained.

Before issuing the Refunding Bonds, the District shall receive

(c) Separate Series. Notwithstanding anything in this Resolution to the contrary, the Refunding Bonds may be issued for the purposes described herein in one or more series from time to time. The Refunding Bonds shall be assigned a designation which indicates the respective series thereof, and all of the terms and provisions of this Resolution shall apply to each individual series of Refunding Bonds as if such series were individually authorized to be issued hereunder.

SECTION 2.02. Terms of Refunding Bonds.

(a) Terms of Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds will be issued as fully registered bonds, without coupons, in the denomination of $5,000 each or any integral multiple thereof, but in an amount not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of Refunding Bonds maturing in the year of maturity of the Refunding Bonds for which the denomination is specified. Refunding Bonds will be lettered and numbered as the Paying Agent may prescribe. The Refunding Bonds will be dated as of the Closing Date.

Interest on the Refunding Bonds is payable semiannually on each Interest Payment Date. Each Refunding Bonds will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date next preceding the date of registration and authentication thereof unless (i) it is authenticated as of an Interest Payment Date, in which event it will bear interest from such date, or (ii) it is authenticated prior to an Interest Payment Date and after the close of business on the Record Date preceding such Interest Payment Date, in which event it will bear interest from such Interest Payment Date, or (iii) it is authenticated prior to the first foregoing, if interest on any Refunding Bond is in default at the time of authentication thereof, such Refunding Bond will bear interest from the Interest Payment Date to which interest has previously been paid or made available for payment thereon.

(b) Maturities; Basis of Interest Calculation. The Refunding Bonds will mature on August 1 (unless otherwise provided in the Bond Purchase Agreement) in the years and in the amounts, and will bear interest at the rates, as determined upon the sale thereof. The final maturity of the Refunding Bonds shall not exceed the limitations prescribed in the Bond Law. Interest on the Refunding Bonds will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

(c) CUSIP Identification Numbers. CUSIP identification numbers will be imprinted on the Refunding Bonds, but such numbers do not constitute a part of the contract evidenced by the Refunding Bonds and any error or omission with respect thereto will not constitute cause for refusal of any purchaser to accept delivery of and pay for the Refunding Bonds. In addition, failure on the part of the District to use such CUSIP numbers in any notice to Owners of the Refunding Bonds will not constitute an event of default or any violation of the District’s contract with such Owners and will not impair the effectiveness of any such notice.

(d) Payment. Interest on any Refunding Bonds issued (including the final interest payment upon maturity or redemption) is payable by check, draft or wire of the Paying Agent mailed to the Owner thereof (which will be DTC so long as the Refunding Bonds are held in the book-entry system of DTC) at such Owner’s address as it appears on the Registration Books at the close of business on the preceding Record Date; except that at the written request of the Owner of at least $1,000,000 aggregate principal amount

-6-
<!-- Page 428 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

of any Refunding Bonds, which written request is on file with the Paying Agent as of any Record Date, interest on such Refunding Bonds will be paid on the succeeding Interest Payment Date to such account as will be specified in such written request. Principal of the Refunding Bonds is payable in lawful money of the United States of America upon presentation and surrender at the Office of the Paying Agent.

(e) Provisions of Bond Purchase Agreement to Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section and the following provisions of Section 2.03, any of the terms of the Refunding Bonds may be established or modified under the Bond Purchase Agreement. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this Resolution and the Bond Purchase Agreement relating to the terms of the Refunding Bonds, the provisions of the Bond Purchase Agreement will be controlling.

SECTION 2.03. Redemption of Refunding Bonds

(a) Optional Redemption Dates and Prices. The Refunding Bonds are subject to redemption prior to maturity, at the option of the District, in whole or in part, from any available source of funds, on the dates and at the respective redemption prices as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement.

(b) Mandatory Sinking Fund Redemption. If the Bond Purchase Agreement specifies that any one or more maturities of the Refunding Bonds are term bonds which are subject to mandatory sinking fund redemption, each such maturity of Refunding Bonds shall be subject to such mandatory sinking fund redemption on August 1 (unless otherwise provided in the Bond Purchase Agreement) in each of the years and in the respective principal amounts as set forth in the Bond Purchase Agreement, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed (without premium), together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption. If any such term bonds are redeemed under the provisions of the preceding clause (a), the total amount of all future payments under this subsection (b) with respect to such term bonds shall be reduced by the aggregate principal amount of such term bonds so redeemed, to be allocated among such payments on a pro rata basis in integral multiples of $5,000 (or on such other basis as the District may determine) as set forth in written notice given by the District to the Paying Agent.

(c) Selection of Refunding Bonds for Redemption. Whenever less than all of the Outstanding Refunding Bonds of any one maturity are designated for redemption, the Paying Agent shall select the Outstanding Refunding Bonds of such maturity to be redeemed by lot in any manner deemed fair by the Paying Agent. For purposes of such selection, each Refunding Bond will be deemed to consist of individual bonds of $5,000 principal amount. The Refunding Bonds may all be separately redeemed.

(d) Redemption Procedure. The Paying Agent will cause notice of any redemption to be mailed, first class mail, postage prepaid, at least 20 days but not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption, to the respective Owners of any Refunding Bonds designated for redemption, at their addresses appearing on the Registration Books. Such notice may be a conditional notice of redemption and subject to rescission as set forth in clause (e) below. Such mailing is not a condition precedent to such redemption and the failure to mail or to receive any such notice will not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of such Refunding Bonds. In addition, the Paying Agent will give notice of redemption by telecopy or certified, registered or overnight mail to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and each of the Securities Depositories at least two days prior to such mailing to the Refunding Bond Owners.

-7-
<!-- Page 429 -->
Such notice shall state the redemption date and the redemption price and, if less than all of the then Outstanding Refunding Bonds are to be called for redemption, shall designate the serial numbers of the Refunding Bonds to be redeemed by giving the individual number of each Refunding Bond or by stating that all Refunding Bonds between two stated numbers, both inclusive, or by stating that all of the Refunding Bonds of one or more maturities have been called for redemption, and shall require that such Refunding Bonds be then surrendered at the Office of the Paying Agent for redemption at the said redemption price, giving notice also that further interest on such Refunding Bonds will not accrue from and after the redemption date.

Upon surrender of Refunding Bonds redeemed in part only, the District shall execute, and the Paying Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the Owner, at the expense of the District, a new Refunding Bond or Bonds, of the same maturity, of authorized denominations in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Refunding Bond or Bonds.

From and after the date fixed for redemption, if notice of such redemption has been duly given and funds available for the payment of the principal of and interest (and premium, if any) on the Refunding Bonds so called for redemption have been duly provided, the Refunding Bonds called for redemption will cease to be entitled to any benefit under this Resolution other than the right to receive payment of the redemption price, and no interest will accrue thereon on or after the redemption date specified in the notice. The Paying Agent will cancel all Refunding Bonds redeemed under this Section and will furnish a certificate of cancellation to the District.

(e) Right to Rescind Notice of Redemption. The District has the right to rescind any notice of the optional redemption of Refunding Bonds under subsection (a) of this Section by written notice to the Paying Agent on or prior to the date fixed for redemption. Any notice of redemption shall be cancelled and annulled if for any reason funds will not be or are not available on the date fixed for redemption for the payment in full of the Refunding Bonds then called for redemption. The District and the Paying Agent shall have no liability to the Refunding Bond Owners, or any other party related to or arising from such rescission of redemption. The Paying Agent shall mail notice of such rescission of redemption in the same manner as the original notice of redemption was sent under subsection (c) of this Section.

SECTION 2.04. Form of Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds, the form of the Paying Agent’s certificate of authentication and registration and the form of assignment to appear thereon will be substantially in the form with necessary or appropriate variations, omissions and insertions, as permitted or required by this Resolution and the Bond Purchase Agreement, as are set forth in Appendix A attached hereto.

SECTION 2.05. Execution of Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds shall be signed by the facsimile signature of the President, Vice President or Clerk of the Board and shall be attested by the facsimile signature of a District Representative. Only those Refunding Bonds bearing a certificate of authentication and registration in the form set forth in Appendix A attached hereto, executed and dated by the Paying Agent, shall be valid or obligatory for any purpose or entitled to the benefits of this Resolution, and such certificate of the Paying Agent is conclusive evidence that the Refunding Bonds so registered have been duly authenticated, registered and delivered hereunder and are entitled to the benefits of this Resolution.

## SECURITY FOR THE REFUNDING BONDS;  
### DEBT SERVICE FUND

### SECTION 4.01. Security for the Refunding Bonds. 
The Refunding Bonds are general obligations of the District. The Board has the power to direct the County to levy ad valorem taxes upon all property within the District that is subject to taxation by the District, without limitation of rate or amount, for the payment of the Refunding Bonds and the interest and redemption premium (if any) thereon. The District hereby directs the County to levy on all the taxable property in the District, in addition to all other taxes, a continuing direct and ad valorem tax annually during the period the Refunding Bonds are Outstanding in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due, including the principal of any Refunding Bonds upon the mandatory sinking fund redemption thereof (if any), which moneys when collected will be paid to the County Auditor-Controller and placed in the Debt Service Fund. Additionally, the County is directed to include in the tax levy the expense of paying the Refunding Bonds elsewhere than at the office of the Director of Finance.

The principal of and interest and redemption premium (if any) on the Refunding Bonds does not constitute a debt of the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions other than the District, or any of the officers, agents or employees thereof. Neither the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions nor any of the officers, agents or employees thereof are liable for the Refunding Bonds. In no event are the principal of and interest and redemption premium (if any) on Refunding Bonds payable out of any funds or properties of the District other than taxable property in the District. The Refunding Bonds, including the interest thereon, are payable solely from taxes levied under Sections 15250 and 15252 of the Education Code.

The District hereby pledges all revenues from the property taxes collected from the levy by the County for the payment of the Refunding Bonds and the amounts in the Debt Service Fund (the “Pledged Revenues”) to the payment of the principal and interest on the Refunding Bonds. It is the intention of the District that (i) for purposes of 11 U.S.C. §902(2)(E), the Pledged Revenues constitute “taxes specifically levied to finance one or more projects or systems” of the District and are not “general property, sales or income taxes . . . levied to finance the general purposes of” the District, and (ii) the pledge of the Pledged Revenues constitutes a pledge of “special revenues” for purposes of 11 U.S.C. §§901 et seq., and that a petition filed by the District under 11 U.S.C. §901 et seq., will not operate as a stay under 11 U.S.C. §362 of the application of such Pledged Revenues to payment when due of principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds. The District will not take any action inconsistent with its agreement and statement of intention hereunder and will not deny that the pledge of the Pledged Revenues constitutes a pledge of special revenues for purposes of 11 U.S.C. §§901 et seq.

### SECTION 4.02. Establishment of Debt Service Fund. 
The District hereby directs the Director of Finance to establish, hold and maintain a fund designated as the “San Juan Unified School District 2024 General Obligation Refunding Bonds Debt Service Fund,” which the Director of Finance shall maintain as a separate account, distinct from all other funds of the County and the District. All taxes levied by the County, at the request of the District, for the payment of the principal of and interest and premium (if any) on the Refunding Bonds shall be deposited in the Debt Service Fund by the County promptly upon appointment of said levy.

SECTION 4.03. Disbursements from Debt Service Fund. The Director of Finance shall administer the Debt Service Fund and make disbursements therefrom in the manner set forth in this Section. The Director of Finance shall transfer amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Fund, to the extent necessary to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds when due and payable, to the Paying Agent which, in turn, shall pay such moneys to DTC to pay the principal of and interest on the Refunding Bonds. DTC will thereupon make payments of principal and interest to the beneficial owners of the Refunding Bonds. Any moneys remaining in the Debt Service Fund after the Refunding Bonds and the interest thereon have been paid shall be transferred to any other interest and sinking fund or account for general obligation bond indebtedness of the District, including refunding bonds, and in the event there is no such debt outstanding, shall be transferred to the District’s general fund upon the order of the County Auditor, as provided in Section 15234 of the Education Code.

SECTION 4.04. Pledge of Taxes. The District hereby pledges all revenues from property taxes collected from the levy by the Board of Supervisors of the County for the District’s payment of the Refunding Bonds and amounts on deposit in the Debt Service Fund to the District’s payment of the principal or redemption price of and interest on the Refunding Bonds. This pledge shall be valid and binding from the date hereof for the benefit of the owners of the Refunding Bonds and successors thereto. The property taxes and amounts held in the Debt Service Fund shall be immediately subject to this pledge, and the pledge shall constitute a lien and security interest which shall immediately attach to the property taxes and amounts held in the interest and sinking fund to secure the District’s payment of the Refunding Bonds and shall be effective, binding, and enforceable against the District, its successors, creditors and all others irrespective of whether those parties have notice of the pledge and without the need of any physical delivery, recordation, filing, or further act. This pledge constitutes an agreement between the District and owners of the Refunding Bonds to provide security for the Refunding Bonds in addition to any statutory lien that may exist. The District hereby represents and warrants that all of its general obligation bonds, including the Refunding Bonds are or were issued to finance or refinance one or more of the projects specified in the applicable voter-approved measure.

SECTION 4.05. Investments. All moneys held in any of the funds or accounts established with the County hereunder will be invested in Authorized Investments in accordance with the investment policies of the County, as such policies exist at the time of investment. Obligations purchased as an investment of moneys in any fund or account will be deemed to be part of such fund or account. All interest or gain derived from the investment of amounts in any of the funds or accounts established hereunder will be deposited in the fund or account from which such investment was made, and will be expended for the purposes thereof.

This Bond is secured by a statutory lien on all revenues received pursuant to the levy and collection of the ad valorem tax, which attaches automatically without further action or authorization by the District and is valid and binding from the time this Bond is executed and delivered.

The Bonds are being issued subject to the terms and conditions of the Resolution. All capitalized terms herein and not otherwise defined have the meaning given them in the Resolution. Reference is hereby made to the Resolution (copies of which are on file at the office of the Paying Agent) and the Bond Law for a description of the terms on which the Bonds are issued and the rights thereunder of the owners of the Bonds and the rights, duties and immunities of the Paying Agent and the rights and obligations of the District thereunder, to all of the provisions of which Resolution the Owner of this Bond, by acceptance hereof, assents and agrees.

The principal of and interest on this Bond does not constitute a debt of the County, the State of California, or any of its political subdivisions other than the District, or any of the officers, agents and employees thereof, and neither the County, the State of California, any of its political subdivisions, nor any of the officers, agents and employees thereof shall be liable hereon. In no event shall the principal of and interest on this Bond be payable out of any funds or properties of the District other than ad valorem taxes levied upon all taxable property in the District.

The Bonds of this issue are issuable only as fully registered Bonds in the denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. This Bond is exchangeable and transferable for Bonds of other authorized denominations at the principal corporate trust office of the Paying Agent, by the Registered Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so, upon presentation and surrender hereof to the Paying Agent, together with a request for exchange or an assignment signed by the Registered Owner or by a person legally empowered to do so, in a form satisfactory to the Paying Agent, all subject to the terms, limitations and conditions provided in the Bond Resolution. Any tax or governmental charges shall be paid by the transferor. The District and the Paying Agent may deem and treat the Registered Owner as the absolute owner of this Bond for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of principal or interest and for all other purposes, and neither the District nor the Paying Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

The Bonds maturing on or before August 1, 20__ are not subject to redemption prior to their respective stated maturities.

The Paying Agent shall give notice of the redemption of the Bonds at the expense of the District. Such notice shall specify: (a) that the Bonds or a designated portion thereof are to be redeemed, (b) the numbers and CUSIP numbers of the Bonds to be redeemed, (c) the date of notice and the date of redemption, (d) the place or places where the redemption will be made, and (e) descriptive information regarding the Bonds including the dated date, interest rate and stated maturity date.

Such notice may be conditional and subject to rescission as described in the Resolution.

Notice of redemption shall be by registered or otherwise secured mail or delivery service, postage prepaid, to the registered owner of the Bonds, to a municipal registered securities depository and to a national information service that disseminates securities redemption notices and, by first class mail, postage prepaid, to the District and the respective Owners of any Bonds designated for redemption at their addresses appearing on the Bond registration books, in every case at least 20 days, but not more than 60 days, prior to the redemption date; provided that neither failure to receive such notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed shall affect the sufficiency of the proceedings for the redemption of such Bonds.

Neither the District nor the Paying Agent will be required: (a) to issue or transfer any Bond during a period beginning with the opening of business on the 15th calendar day next preceding either any Interest Payment Date or any date of selection of any Bond to be redeemed and ending with the close of business on the Interest Payment Date or a day on which the applicable notice of redemption is given, or (b) to transfer any Bond which has been selected or called for redemption in whole or in part.
