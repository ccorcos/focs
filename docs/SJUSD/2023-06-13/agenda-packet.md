Due to our collaboration with Head Start, each family fills out a Family Partnership Agreement (FPA) which identifies needs, strengths, and interests of the family. The information the families provide is given to the School Community Worker (SCW) as a way to check with families and help provide support to families should they need assistance or support.

# LCFF Budget Overview for Parents

The LCFF gives school districts more flexibility in deciding how to use state funds. In exchange, school districts must work with parents, educators, students, and the community to develop a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) that shows how they will use these funds to serve students.

## Plan Summary [2023-24]

### General Information
A description of the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades transitional kindergarten–12, as applicable to the LEA.

Valuing diversity and excellence, San Juan Unified School District’s (SJUSD) mission is to empower all in our inclusive learning community to contribute and thrive in a radically evolving world. Our shared values include inclusivity, real-world knowledge, voice, social and emotional intelligence, and perseverance. Through policies, practices, programs, and decisions, SJUSD will reduce the predictability of which students fail by utilizing an equity lens to eliminate barriers for our specific populations.

Welcoming schools that support the social and emotional needs of our students form the foundation for academic excellence. We recognize this is built through the continuous improvement of intentional collaborative efforts that are focused on the following:

1. Connected School Communities: Caring staff actively build community relationships, identify assets and needs, and connect students and families with resources to help them access the best opportunities our schools have to offer.
<!-- Page 108 -->
2. Healthy Environments for Social-Emotional Growth: Staff will cultivate inclusive, safe, equitable, culturally responsive, and healthy environments by integrating social and emotional learning to ensure essential student development.

3. Engaging Academic Programs: Staff educators will engage and support each student in a challenging and broad course of study that builds skills, knowledge, and experiences preparing all to be critical thinkers who communicate effectively, collaborate, and are civic-minded.

4. Clear Pathways to Bright Futures: Our whole school community engages each student in discovering their limitless potential, and through coordinated efforts prepares them for college, career, and bright futures filled with opportunity.

SJUSD has 65 schools, employs approximately 5,526 staff, covers 75 square miles, and serves the communities of Arden-Arcade, Carmichael, Citrus Heights, Fair Oaks, Gold River, and Orangevale. Within the district are diverse groups of students including a significant number of refugee and immigrant students who speak Spanish, Dari, Pashto, Farsi, Russian, Arabic, Ukrainian, and many other languages. Approximately 57% of our students qualify for low-income services and are enrolled at every school campus throughout the district.

Our schools strive to meet the needs of each student with comprehensive, standards-aligned programs along with specialized services and programs, including Montessori, Spanish Dual Immersion, Rapid Learner, International Baccalaureate, CIVITAS, career technical pathways, Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), and other specialties. Individual schools may also have a specialized focus on science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM). Enrollment beyond the neighborhood school is available through the open enrollment process each winter. San Juan also has programs for infants/toddlers, preschool, and adult education throughout the district.

While each school is unique, we are committed to providing a high-quality education for every student that includes:
- A challenging, standards-based academic program at every school
- Additional supports for students who require extra assistance
- Enrichment opportunities and programs

Recognizing that students may face a variety of challenges and needs, SJUSD ensures the success of each student by providing academic, behavioral, and social-emotional supports through our multi-tiered system of support (MTSS) as well as engaging, relevant, and innovative instruction and programs. Using a continuous improvement process, we continue to adjust our efforts to better meet the needs of our children and families by partnering with parents/guardians, staff, students, and the community.

The graphs below show the district’s student demographics. As of March 15, 2023, there are approximately 37,975 TK-12 students enrolled. Our diverse student population includes 57% socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED), 17.7% English learners (EL), 13.3% students with disabilities (SWD), 3.5% homeless youth (HM), and 0.4% foster youth (FY).

**Reflections: Successes**  
A description of successes and/or progress based on a review of the California School Dashboard (Dashboard) and local data.

San Juan Unified expanded its educational partner engagement in 2022-23 by increasing the number of groups and participants engaged as well as conducting more targeted and intentional outreach. For example, SJUSD increased:
- The number of ThoughtExchange and listening session participants from approximately 1420 to 2500.
- The number of educational partner groups from approximately 45 to 65 with an emphasis on our targeted student groups.
- The number of students from our targeted groups who facilitate listening sessions as part of our San Juan Youth Voice Advocates (SJYVA).

In 2021-22, the percentage of current English learner (EL) students who made progress towards English language proficiency was 51.8%, which was higher than the statewide average. Additionally, reclassified ELs performed above standard in English Language Arts. Local data results also show an increase in students scoring at a level 4 performance level, most prominently for our EL students who have been in the US for more than 5 years.

To build upon this success and continue to make progress in meeting the academic and language needs of our ELs with various profiles, San Juan Unified will implement:
- Intervention and enrichment opportunities to accelerate English language proficiency such as after school tutoring, Saturday classes, Summer Math Camp, Camp Invention, and English Language Proficiency Assessments for California (ELPAC) Bootcamp.
- Bilingual Instructional Assistants (BIA) to provide scaffolds and supports focused on literacy and academic discourse.
- School Community Resource Assistants (SCRA) to build relationships and partnerships with our EL community, and connect students and families with resources and tools to navigate the American school system.
- Professional learning and additional staff such as program specialists and Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSA) to support integrated and designated English language development using the EL Roadmap, content standards, Universal Design for Learning framework (UDL), and Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD).
- And, finally, parent engagement workshops focused on how to support instructional learning at home.

In 2021-22, 37.6% of students in kindergarten through grade 8 were chronically absent and missed 10 percent or more of the instructional days they were enrolled. However, when we look at how the student absence rate of our chronically absent students has changed over time between 2021-22 and 2022-23, we see that chronically absent students are missing fewer days of school and showing improved average daily attendance. For example, in semester 1 of the 2021-22 school year, the percent of chronically absent students who missed more than 15% of school days was 18.3%. Whereas the percent of chronically absent students who missed more than 15% of school days in semester 1 of the 2022-23 school year decreased to 14.3%.

To build upon this success and to make progress, San Juan will implement actions that include:
- Transportation for our foster youth and homeless students and increasing ridership.
- Staffing and community partnerships to expand access to resources, programs, and services.
<!-- Page 112 -->
- Increasing communication by coordinating our outreach efforts across the district through our Family and Community Engagement (FACE) Mobile, parent workshops, and social media. And, at the site level, through our school leaders, teachers, counselors, social workers, and staff.
- Regular meetings with families in their home language to provide: 1) Resources such as technology devices, internet access to students, free bus passes, food and clothing; 2) Services such as mental health support, translators, and alternative education programs; 3) Interventions by engaging students and families in co-creating home routines and plans.

## Reflections: Identified Need
A description of any areas that need significant improvement based on a review of Dashboard and local data, including any areas of low performance and significant performance gaps among student groups on Dashboard indicators, and any steps taken to address those areas.

Based on a review of the Dashboard, there is a need to increase the number of students who are meeting grade-level standards in English Language Arts (ELA) and mathematics on the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP), which is taken by students in grades 3-8 and grade 11. There is also a need to reduce the suspension rate of students in kindergarten through grade 12 who have been suspended at least once in a given school year (students who are suspended multiple times are only counted once on the Dashboard indicator). Student groups with significant performance gaps in these areas include African American, English learner, foster youth, homeless youth, and students with disabilities.

To address the disparities for our student groups and improve overall student performance in ELA and math, San Juan Unified is implementing actions that include:
- Professional learning, coaching, and collaboration for teachers focused on instruction aligned to the ELA, history-social science, and math frameworks.
- Tier 1 and 2 academic interventions through our Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) as well as a universal screener for dyslexia.
- Effective instructional practices such as co-teaching and Universal Design for Learning (UDL), which are differentiated and inclusive approaches to teaching and learning.
- Tutoring, flex periods, and diagnostics to provide targeted small group instruction to students.
- Intervention teachers and instructional assistants in our elementary and K-8 schools to provide additional support to students.

In response to our suspension data, we are providing schools with a multi-tiered system of social, emotional, behavioral, and mental health supports. These include:
- Direct services to students such as counseling services, mentoring programs, and K-12 support center services.
- Additional staff to support schools with reviewing data, aligning resources to the data, and implementing social emotional learning programs.
- Professional development such as alternative practices to suspension focused on Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), Restorative Practices (RP), and de-escalation training.
- Network Improvement Communities (NIC) focused on continuous improvement practices that support our African American students and students with disabilities.
<!-- Page 113 -->
- Unconscious bias training, culturally responsive and restorative strategies to support safety planning, training, and student supervision.

Additionally, Differentiated Assistance (DA) is provided to assist districts in improving outcomes for student groups who have performed at the lowest level for multiple years on the California School Dashboard indicators. San Juan Unified met the criteria for differentiated assistance and is required by the California Department of Education to include an additional LCAP goal to outline support for the following student groups: foster youth, homeless youth, and students with disabilities.

## LCAP Highlights
A brief overview of the LCAP, including any key features that should be emphasized.

By integrating the planning process of the LCAP, Expanded Learning Opportunities (ELO), and Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER III) expenditure plans, San Juan created a comprehensive three-year plan that braided the funds, actions, services, and strategies of each plan to address the immediate and long-term impact of COVID-19. Specifically, the plans address students' academic, social, emotional, and mental health needs as well as continuous and safe in-person learning with an emphasis on our priority student groups.

In developing these three plans, San Juan developed, maintained, and expanded engagement with our educational partners to shape and influence each plan's actions and expenditures. As part of San Juan’s continuous improvement efforts, we engaged multiple educational partner groups that included students, employees, staff, labor groups, and community partners. We used multiple outreach and engagement strategies to maximize participation, differentiate our approach, and lift the voice of our diverse community, specifically those of our historically underrepresented students and families. The strategies included:
- ThoughtExchanges, listening sessions, focus groups, and surveys.
- Engaging our educational partners in 1:1, small, and large group settings through online, phone, in-person, and paper communication.
- Communicating these opportunities with our educational partners in a variety of ways including through the district website, mass notification, social media, community newsletters, and targeted outreach.

Community input from educational partner groups was collected, which was then used to develop and align actions across all three plans that build and expand on one another to provide a cohesive and comprehensive strategy.

An additional highlight is our districtwide focus on leading for equity-driven continuous improvement (EDCI). This means getting better at removing barriers as well as creating pathways and access to opportunities for all students with a specific focus on our English learner (EL), low-income (LI), and foster youth (FY) students. To improve our capacity to lead for EDCI, our Division of Teaching and Learning Staff focused on the following key areas:
- Planning with our EL, LI, FY students in mind first.
<!-- Page 114 -->
![San Juan Unified School District Local Control Accountability Plan](https://example.com/image.png)

- Monitoring progress and implementation of actions.
- Using inquiry-based processes to drive learning and improvement.
- Focusing on improving outcomes, experiences, and access to opportunities for our EL, LI, and FY students.

## Comprehensive Support and Improvement
An LEA with a school or schools eligible for comprehensive support and improvement must respond to the following prompts.

### Schools Identified
A list of the schools in the LEA that are eligible for comprehensive support and improvement.
- Katherine Johnson
- La Entrada
- La Vista
- Starr King

### Support for Identified Schools
A description of how the LEA has or will support its eligible schools in developing comprehensive support and improvement plans.

San Juan Unified School District will provide schools that met the criteria for Comprehensive Support and Improvement (CSI) the opportunity to participate in a Networked Improvement Community (NIC). The NIC is a five-part series that works through the four stages of continuous improvement which includes conducting a needs assessment and root cause analysis, defining goals and evidence-based interventions, prototyping and implementing solutions, and measuring and reporting on the impact of the improvement plans. The purpose is for each school site to make changes in practice that reflect student needs and result in improved outcomes, experiences, and opportunities for students.

Each of the five network meetings will provide school leadership teams with an opportunity to engage in the continuous improvement process to address their Problem of Practice (i.e., suspension, attendance, African American achievement, etc.), and the learning space to collaborate with partner school sites within the network to share ideas, resources, and best practices.

In addition to the network meetings, a coach will be assigned to each school site to provide expert guidance and personalized support throughout the NIC process. The coach will also act as a thought partner during the network meetings to help eligible CSI schools achieve their goals, and to ensure that school leadership teams are equipped with the necessary tools and resources to drive improvement. Collectively, the NIC and coach will support the development and implementation of the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) in alignment with the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP).

**Monitoring and Evaluating Effectiveness**  
A description of how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the plan to support student and school improvement.

The district NIC facilitator and coach will engage in the following practices to monitor and evaluate the plan to support student and school improvement: 1) provide regular check-ins with site administrators and school improvement teams to refine and modify improvement plans based on regular review of data and information; 2) review each school’s Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) plans and inquiry cycles to identify measurable and actionable goals; and 3) create and share site reports with each school to provide feedback and monitor progress of plans.

# Engaging Educational Partners
A summary of the process used to engage educational partners and how this engagement was considered before finalizing the LCAP.

San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD) is committed to ensuring the voices of students, staff, families, and community members are lifted into the planning, implementation, and reflection process for how our approximately 37,975 TK-12 students are engaged in learning. Outlined below is the district process for gathering educational partner input to inform the actions and services in the 2023-24 Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP).

Between November 2022 and March 2023, we engaged approximately 2500 participants and over 65 educational partner groups using questions identified from our four goal areas:
- Connected School Communities
- Healthy Environments for Social and Emotional Growth
- Engaging Academic Programs
- Clear Pathways to Bright Futures

Educational partner listening sessions were held with statutorily required groups such as students, parents/guardians, community partners, district staff, and collective bargaining groups as well as priority populations such as English learner, low income, and foster youth students. On March 16, 2023, the Local Control and Accountability Parent Advisory Committee (LCAP PAC) met to review educational input themes to identify shared areas of interest within and across educational partners groups as they relate to services supporting English learner, low-income, foster youth and, more broadly, all students. District focus teams and the Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) team reviewed and monitored 2022-23 LCAP actions, metrics, and expenditures throughout the year. Additionally, LCAP PAC perspectives and insights, educational partner key themes, and climate survey results were used to support the planning and development of the 2023-24 LCAP. On May 25, 2023, a draft plan of the LCAP was presented to the LCAP PAC and the District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC) in separate meetings. Both groups reviewed the LCAP and provided comments to the district superintendent. The superintendent's responses were posted on the district LCAP website and were shared with the LCAP PAC and the DELAC. The draft LCAP was posted on the district LCAP website and was also placed in the district lobby to allow written comments to be submitted prior to the public hearing. On June 13, 2023, the LCAP draft plan was presented in a public meeting, and on June 27, 2023, the LCAP was adopted by the local governing board.

## A summary of the feedback provided by specific educational partners.

SJUSD used focus groups, listening sessions, surveys, and ThoughtExchanges to engage our educational partners. Two questions were asked with modifications as needed for accessibility:
- What are some things our schools are doing well to support students and families?

Additionally, from January 10 through February 13, 2023, a climate survey was administered to students in grades 4-12 as well as parents/guardians and staff across the district. The survey included items and categories aligned to LCAP actions and metrics. There were 21,288 total responses that included 10,280 student, 9,358 parent, and 1,650 staff responses.

Educational partner input was then reviewed within and across groups for common themes to identify both districtwide and student group-specific needs with an emphasis on English learners, low-income, and foster youth students. The themes by goal area that emerged from our educational partners include:

**Goal 1 - Connected School Communities:**

**A description of the aspects of the LCAP that were influenced by specific input from educational partners:**

Realigning and strengthening the district’s strategic plan to the LCAP resulted in an updated strategic framework, which included a revised mission statement, newly created shared values, an equity lens statement, and four focus areas. A critical aspect of the updated strategic framework was the recognition that to better meet the needs of our students and families, support our continuous improvement work, and inform the planning of the LCAP, the district needed to expand the scope of listening and learning with educational partners in the community to ensure a diversity of voices were represented in the LCAP.

An expanded educational partner engagement process was implemented resulting in an increase in the number of diverse educational partners engaged, especially students, who provided their voice in the development of the LCAP as well as facilitated listening sessions. Additionally, the quality of educational partner feedback improved because of the questions being connected to the four focus areas. This allowed the district to identify needs and actions for our priority groups and, more broadly, for all groups across the district.

The input collected from our educational partner groups was organized into common themes both within and across groups. These common themes were identified in consultation with the Local Control and Accountability Plan Parent Advisory Committee (LCAP PAC), district staff, and San Juan Youth Voice Advocates (SJYVA). Lastly, the summarized educational partner input as well as local and state data results were shared with district LCAP focus area teams and SELPA team who revised, removed, and added to the LCAP actions, services, and expenditures resulting in the revised LCAP for the 2023-24 school year.
<!-- Page 120 -->
![Goals and Actions](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Goals+and+Actions)

## Goals and Actions

### Goal

| Goal # | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1      | Connected School Communities: Caring staff actively build community relationships, identify assets and needs, and connect students and families with resources to help them access the best opportunities our schools have to offer. |

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

Goals 1-4 were developed to focus the district’s continuous improvement work and developed with our educational partners as part of our strategic planning process during the 2019-20 school year. Each goal is aligned and in response to the state and local Dashboard data areas, and reflective of the shared interests within and across educational partner groups.

To achieve each goal, actions, and metrics have been strategically grouped together based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative data to identify potential causes contributing to Dashboard results. This analysis included a review of state and local data, educational partner voice, process maps, and research with a focus on improving student outcomes, experiences, and access to opportunities.

Performance will be measured using multiple metrics listed in the Measuring and Reporting Results section of each goal using the 3-year desired outcomes listed for each metric to monitor progress and improvement. To achieve each goal, actions and expenditures (see Actions section) will be implemented and updated annually based on a review of educational partner input and state and local data.

**Goal Analysis [2022-23]**  
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.  

All actions within goal 1 were implemented as planned without substantive differences. The challenges experienced during implementation included:  
- Staff shortage and vacancies at school sites  
- Substitute shortage for staff to attend professional learning  
- Staff resignations  

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.  

Material differences between budgeted and estimated actual expenditures were due to staffing and substitute shortages, vacancies, and shifting funding to sources outside of the LCAP.  

An explanation of how effective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal.  

**Actions:** 1.1, 1.3, 1.4  
**Metrics:**  
- Chronic Absenteeism: Between 2018-19 and 2022-23, the disparity rate and overall percentage of chronically absent students in grades TK-8 increased. We have not yet met our desired outcome for the overall rate and disparity rate.  
- Attendance: Between 2018-19 and 2022-23, the disparity rate increased and the overall attendance rate for students in grades TK-8 has decreased. We have not yet met our desired outcome for the overall rate and disparity rate.  
- Participation, Engagement, and Motivation: Between 2019-20 and 2022-23, the percent of schools where at least 3/4 of students, parents, and staff respond “agree” or “strongly agree” on the district climate survey decreased for students, increased for staff, and decreased for parents. We have not yet met our desired outcome for students, staff, parents.  
- High Expectations and Caring Relationships: Between 2019-20 and 2022-23, the percent of schools where at least 3/4 of students, parents, and staff respond “agree” or “strongly agree” on the district climate survey decreased for students, staff, and parents. We have not yet met our desired outcome for students, staff, parents.

- Parent Engagement in Leadership Roles: Between 2019-20 and 2022-23, the percentage of parents of unduplicated students in leadership roles increased, and we have met our desired outcome.
- Parent and Family Engagement: Between 2018-19 and 2022-23, district ratings on the parent engagement self-reflection tool increased for building relationships between school staff and families, building partnerships for student outcomes, and seeking input for decision-making. We are meeting our desired outcome.

Actions: 1.2
- Staffing Ethnic Diversity: Between 2019-20 and 2022-23, the percentage of staff that reflects the ethnic diversity of the student population for SJUSD has decreased for non-white certificated staff and increased for non-white classified staff. We have met our desired outcome for non-white classified staff and not yet met our desired outcome for non-white certificated staff.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

Metrics:
- Parent Engagement in Leadership Roles: Metric description changed to specify priority student groups and district committees.

Actions:
- Action 1.1 increased funding and expanded to include two bilingual Communications Specialists in the district's communications department, a two-way text-messaging vendor with advanced translation features, Sierra Nevada Journeys summer academy, and additional support for west-end schools via a resource mobile benefiting both students and families.
- Action 1.2 (previously 1.5) increased funding and expanded to include Alder Teacher Residency program.
- Action 1.3 increased funding to hire additional bilingual instructional assistants and increase existing staff hours.
- Action 1.4 increased funding for staffing to provide additional essential support to immigrant and refugee students and families.

## Goals and Actions

### Goal

| Goal # | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 2      | Healthy Environments for Social and Emotional Growth: All staff cultivate inclusive, safe, equitable, culturally responsive and healthy environments by integrating social and emotional learning to ensure essential student development. |

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

Goals 1-4 were developed to focus the district’s continuous improvement work and developed with our educational partners as part of our strategic planning process during the 2019-20 school year. Each goal is aligned and in response to the state and local Dashboard data areas, and reflective of the shared interests within and across educational partner groups.

To achieve each goal, actions, and metrics have been strategically grouped together based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative data to identify potential causes contributing to Dashboard results. This analysis included a review of state and local data, educational partner voice, process maps, and research with a focus on improving student outcomes, experiences, and access to opportunities.

Performance will be measured using multiple metrics listed in the Measuring and Reporting Results section of each goal using the 3-year desired outcomes listed for each metric to monitor progress and improvement. To achieve each goal, actions and expenditures (see Actions section) will be implemented and updated annually based on a review of educational partner input and state and local data.

## Goal Analysis [2022-23]
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

All actions within goal 2 were implemented as planned without substantive differences. The challenges experienced during implementation included:
- Shift from a reactive approach during COVID to a proactive approach post-COVID to implementing programs and services
- Staff shortage and vacancies impacted club supervision, ability to meet Teen Intervene referrals, and resulted in delayed start for bullying prevention programs
- Club participation due to student scheduling conflicts
- Student transportation to district office for leadership meetings
- Substitute shortage impacted staff professional development attendance

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.

Material differences between budgeted and estimated actual expenditures were due to staffing and substitute shortages, vacancies, and shifting funding to sources outside of the LCAP.

An explanation of how effective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal.

Actions: 2.1, 2.4  
Metrics:
- Suspension Rate: Between 2018-19 and 2022-23, the disparity rate and overall percentage of students who have one or more days of home/in-school suspension decreased, most prominently for AA, FY, and HM students. While we are meeting our desired outcome for the overall rate, we have not yet met the desired outcome for the disparity rate.
<!-- Page 133 -->
- Suspension: Between 2018-19 and 2022-23, the disparity rate and overall number of days of instruction lost to home/in-school suspension per 100 students decreased, most prominently for AA, SWD, FY, and HM students. We are meeting our desired outcome for the overall rate and disparity rate.
- Expulsion Rate: Between 2018-19 and 2021-22, the disparity rate and overall percentage of students expelled from school decreased, most prominently for AA, FY, and HM students. We are meeting our desired outcome for the overall rate and disparity rate.

Actions: 2.1, 2.3, 2.4  
Metrics:  
- High School Dropout Rate: Between 2018-19 and 2021-22, the percentage of high school students who dropped out (based on the 4-year cohort outcomes) increased. However, the dropout rate decreased for FY students and the disparity rate decreased. While we are meeting our desired outcome for the disparity rate, we have not yet met the desired outcome for the overall rate.  
- Middle School Dropout Rate: Between 2018-19 and 2021-22, the number of middle school students (grades 6-8) who dropped out of school decreased, and we are meeting our desired outcome.  
- School Culture and Sense of Belonging: Between 2021-22 and 2022-23, the percent of schools where at least 3/4 of students, parents, and staff respond “agree” or “strongly agree” on the district climate survey remained constant for students, staff, and parents. We have not yet met our desired outcome for students, staff, parents.

Actions: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.5  
Metrics:  
- Safety: Between 2019-20 and 2022-23, the percent of schools where at least 3/4 of students, parents, and staff respond “agree” or “strongly agree” on the district climate survey decreased for students, staff, and parents. We have not yet met our desired outcome for students, staff, parents.

Actions: 2.5  
Metrics:  
- School Facilities: Between 2019-20 and 2021-22, the percent of schools meeting or exceeding a "good" rating on the Facilities Inspection Tool decreased, and we have not yet met our desired outcome.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

Metrics:  
- High School Dropout Rate: Metric source changed to Dataquest to increase public access to information.

Actions:  
- Action 2.2 increased funding for access to vision screening at seven high-density sites, and expansion of Safe School Ambassadors and Safe School Buddies programs.
<!-- Page 134 -->
- Action 2.3 increased funding and revised description to include student leadership, advocacy development programs, and community partnerships.
- Action 2.4 revised title and description to improve clarity and conciseness.
- Action 2.5 increased funding for campus supervision and relationship building with students, and revised description to improve clarity and conciseness.

A report of the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for last year’s actions may be found in the Annual Update Table. A report of the Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services for last year’s actions may be found in the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table.

## Goals and Actions

### Goal

| Goal # | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 3      | Engaging Academic Programs: All educators engage and support each student in a challenging and broad course of study that builds skills, knowledge and experiences preparing all to be critical thinkers who communicate effectively, collaborate and are civic minded. |

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

Goals 1-4 were developed to focus the district’s continuous improvement work and developed with our educational partners as part of our strategic planning process during the 2019-20 school year. Each goal is aligned and in response to the state and local Dashboard data areas, and reflective of the shared interests within and across educational partner groups.

To achieve each goal, actions, and metrics have been strategically grouped together based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative data to identify potential causes contributing to Dashboard results. This analysis included a review of state and local data, educational partner voice, process maps, and research with a focus on improving student outcomes, experiences, and access to opportunities.

Performance will be measured using multiple metrics listed in the Measuring and Reporting Results section of each goal using the 3-year desired outcomes listed for each metric to monitor progress and improvement. To achieve each goal, actions and expenditures (see Actions section) will be implemented and updated annually based on a review of educational partner input and state and local data.

## Goals and Actions

### Goal

| Goal # | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 4      | Clear Pathways to Bright Futures: Our whole school community engages each student in discovering their limitless potential, and through coordinated efforts prepares them for college, career and bright futures filled with opportunity. |

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

Goals 1-4 were developed to focus the district’s continuous improvement work and developed with our educational partners as part of our strategic planning process during the 2019-20 school year. Each goal is aligned and in response to the state and local Dashboard data areas, and reflective of the shared interests within and across educational partner groups.

To achieve each goal, actions, and metrics have been strategically grouped together based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative data to identify potential causes contributing to Dashboard results. This analysis included a review of state and local data, educational partner voice, process maps, and research with a focus on improving student outcomes, experiences, and access to opportunities.

Performance will be measured using multiple metrics listed in the Measuring and Reporting Results section of each goal using the 3-year desired outcomes listed for each metric to monitor progress and improvement. To achieve each goal, actions and expenditures (see Actions section) will be implemented and updated annually based on a review of educational partner input and state and local data.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal

| Goal # | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 5      | Additional Targeted Support: Differentiated assistance to improve outcomes for student groups who have performed at the lowest level for multiple years on the California School Dashboard indicators. |

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

Differentiated Assistance (DA) is provided to assist districts in improving outcomes for student groups who have performed at the lowest level for multiple years on the California School Dashboard indicators. San Juan Unified met the criteria for differentiated assistance and is required to include an additional LCAP goal to outline support for the following student groups:
- Foster Youth
- Homeless Youth
- Students with Disabilities

This goal includes both new and existing actions, metrics, and expenditures. New actions, metrics, and expenditures were established using a continuous improvement process that included analyzing data, conducting a causal analysis, developing actions, and identifying data to monitor progress. As a result of this process, San Juan believes that the actions included in this goal will improve the performance of foster youth, homeless youth, and students with disabilities as measured by the CA School Dashboard Performance Indicators.

The Budgeted Expenditures for Actions identified as Contributing may be found in the Contributing Actions Table.

## Required Descriptions

For each action being provided to an entire school, or across the entire school district or county office of education (COE), an explanation of (1) how the needs of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students were considered first, and (2) how these actions are effective in meeting the goals for these students.

To identify the needs of our foster youth (FY), English learners (EL), and low-income (LI) students, we reviewed the eight state priority areas, state and local indicators, LCAP metrics, and community engagement data. We then used this data to engage in a continuous improvement process, developed actions that are principally directed towards addressing the needs of our priority student groups, and targeted funds strategically.

We expect these actions to be most effective in improving outcomes, experiences, and access to opportunities for our EL, LI, and FY students because the actions were planned with our priority students in mind first and based on multiple sources of quantitative and qualitative data that included input gathered from educational partners, state and local indicators, practitioner experience, research, and educational theory. Additionally, many of these actions will be implemented districtwide to maximize the impact of these actions throughout the district. Performance will be measured using multiple metrics listed in the Measuring and Reporting Results section of each goal. Progress and effectiveness will be determined by reducing the difference in performance between each priority student group (EL, LI, FY) compared to the overall rate.

The following sections will be organized by LCAP goal, include contributing action numbers, and a list of programs, services, and strategies being implemented to meet the needs of our EL, LI, and FY students.

**A description of how services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students are being increased or improved by the percentage required.**

Based on the State Board of Education (SBE) formula calculator, San Juan Unified School District’s (SJUSD) 2023-24 Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) Supplemental Grant is projected to be $52,076,999. This is an increase of $10,541,258 over last year’s LCFF Supplemental Grant allocation of $41,535,741 which targeted similar student populations.

SJUSD educates approximately 37,975 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. 21,630 students qualify as low-income (LI), 6,718 students are identified as English learners (EL), 1,319 students are identified as homeless (HM), and 151 students are identified as foster youth (FY). In San Juan, the population of EL, LI, and FY students is not necessarily concentrated in a few schools. The district has 35 sites with rates of EL, LI, and FY students exceeding 60% and 54 sites with rates in excess of 40%. This demographic distribution across schools supports the conclusion that programs and services directed in support of our EL, LI, and FY students are needed at all schools. However, LCFF supplementally-funded actions at schools with densities below 40% are targeted principally for our priority student groups.

The actions and services in San Juan’s LCAP, as described in the previous section, are targeted toward supporting students with the greatest need and/or the lowest performance. An examination of students who are failing to meet expected outcomes revealed that students

who are EL, LI, and FY are continually overrepresented. The remaining students who are struggling do not fall into one of the priority groups of students but are enrolled across the district. Each student who is not meeting expected outcomes has a need for tiered services, more skilled teachers, and access to a strong standards-based instructional program. To increase the rate of student success for all students with an emphasis on our EL, LI, and FY students, San Juan will distribute principally directed actions across schools. Additionally, San Juan will increase or improve services for our priority student groups 14.25% above what is provided to all students, which exceeds the 14.23% requirement.

This year’s LCAP includes actions and services intended to support both academic and social-emotional growth. Programs or services targeted to specific groups and sites are included, as well as other actions or services that support our ability to meet the needs of struggling students regardless of which school they attend.

A description of the plan for how the additional concentration grant add-on funding identified above will be used to increase the number of staff providing direct services to students at schools that have a high concentration (above 55 percent) of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students, as applicable.

Actions 2.5 and 3.9 will use concentration grant add-on funds to increase the number of staff providing direct services to students at schools with a high concentration of English learner, low income, and foster youth students. Direct services to students will include staffing for academic and social emotional learning support for English learner and newcomer students using a co-teaching model. Additionally, concentration funds will be used for staffing to improve campus supervision, safety, and relationships with students.

### Staff-to-student ratios by type of school and concentration of unduplicated students

| Schools with a student concentration of 55 percent or less | Schools with a student concentration of greater than 55 percent |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students | 1/28 | 1/20 |
| Staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students | 1/20 | 1/16 |

---

**Introduction and Instructions**  
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) requires local educational agencies (LEAs) to engage their local educational partners in an annual planning process to evaluate their progress within eight state priority areas encompassing all statutory metrics (COEs have 10 state priorities). LEAs document the results of this planning process in the LCAP using the template adopted by the State Board of Education.

The LCAP development process serves three distinct, but related functions:

- **Comprehensive Strategic Planning**: The process of developing and annually updating the LCAP supports comprehensive strategic planning (California Education Code [EC] Section 52064[e][1]). Strategic planning that is comprehensive connects budgetary decisions to teaching and learning performance data. LEAs should continually evaluate the hard choices they make about the use of limited resources to meet student and community needs to ensure opportunities and outcomes are improved for all students.

- **Meaningful Engagement of Educational Partners**: The LCAP development process should result in an LCAP that reflects decisions made through meaningful engagement (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Local educational partners possess valuable perspectives and insights about an LEA's programs and services. Effective strategic planning will incorporate these perspectives and insights in order to identify potential goals and actions to be included in the LCAP.

- **Accountability and Compliance**: The LCAP serves an important accountability function because aspects of the LCAP template require LEAs to show that they have complied with various requirements specified in the LCFF statutes and regulations, most notably:
  - Demonstrating that LEAs are increasing or improving services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students in proportion to the amount of additional funding those students generate under LCFF (EC Section 52064[b][4-6]).
  - Establishing goals, supported by actions and related expenditures, that address the statutory priority areas and statutory metrics (EC sections 52064[b][1] and [2]).
  - Annually reviewing and updating the LCAP to reflect progress toward the goals (EC Section 52064[b][7]).
<!-- Page 185 -->

The LCAP template, like each LEA’s final adopted LCAP, is a document, not a process. LEAs must use the template to memorialize the outcome of their LCAP development process, which should: (a) reflect comprehensive strategic planning (b) through meaningful engagement with educational partners (c) meets legal requirements, as reflected in the final adopted LCAP. The sections included within the LCAP template do not and cannot reflect the full development process, just as the LCAP template itself is not intended as a tool for engaging educational partners.

If a county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction over a single school district, the county board of education and the governing board of the school district may adopt and file for review and approval a single LCAP consistent with the requirements in EC sections 52060, 52068, and 52070. The LCAP must clearly articulate to which entity’s budget (school district or county superintendent of schools) all budgeted and actual expenditures are aligned.

The revised LCAP template for the 2021–22, 2022–23, and 2023–24 school years reflects statutory changes made through Assembly Bill 1840 (Committee on Budget), Chapter 243, Statutes of 2018. These statutory changes enhance transparency regarding expenditures on actions included in the LCAP, including actions that contribute to meeting the requirement to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students, and to streamline the information presented within the LCAP to make adopted LCAPs more accessible for educational partners and the public.

At its most basic, the adopted LCAP should attempt to distill not just what the LEA is doing for students in transitional kindergarten through grade twelve (TK–12), but also allow educational partners to understand what and why, and whether those strategies are leading to improved opportunities and outcomes for students. LEAs are strongly encouraged to use language and a level of detail in their adopted LCAPs intended to be meaningful and accessible for the LEA’s diverse educational partners and the broader public.

In developing and finalizing the LCAP for adoption, LEAs are encouraged to keep the following overarching frame at the forefront of the strategic planning and educational partner engagement functions:

Given present performance across the state priorities and on indicators in the California School Dashboard (Dashboard), how is the LEA using its budgetary resources to respond to TK–12 student and community needs, and address any performance gaps, including by meeting its obligation to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students?

LEAs are encouraged to focus on a set of metrics and actions that the LEA believes, based on input gathered from educational partners, research, and experience, will have the biggest impact on behalf of its TK–12 students.

These instructions address the requirements for each section of the LCAP, but may include information about effective practices when developing the LCAP and completing the LCAP itself. Additionally, information is included at the beginning of each section emphasizing the purpose that each section serves.

## Plan Summary
### Purpose
Page 86 of 106
3-24 Local Control Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District
<!-- Page 186 -->
![Page 87 of 106](https://example.com/image.jpg)

A well-developed Plan Summary section provides a meaningful context for the LCAP. This section provides information about an LEA's community as well as relevant information about student needs and performance. In order to provide a meaningful context for the rest of the LCAP, the content of this section should be clearly and meaningfully related to the content included in the subsequent sections of the LCAP.

## Requirements and Instructions

### General Information
- Briefly describe the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades TK–12, as applicable to the LEA. For example, information about an LEA in terms of geography, enrollment, or employment, the number and size of specific schools, recent community challenges, and other such information as an LEA wishes to include can enable a reader to more fully understand an LEA’s LCAP.

### Reflections: Successes
- Based on a review of performance on the state indicators and local performance indicators included in the Dashboard, progress toward LCAP goals, local self-assessment tools, input from educational partners, and any other information, what progress is the LEA most proud of and how does the LEA plan to maintain or build upon that success? This may include identifying specific examples of how past increases or improvements in services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students have led to improved performance for these students.

### Reflections: Identified Need
- Referring to the Dashboard, identify: (a) any state indicator for which overall performance was in the “Red” or “Orange” performance category or any local indicator where the LEA received a “Not Met” or “Not Met for Two or More Years” rating AND (b) any state indicator for which performance for any student group was two or more performance levels below the “all student” performance. What steps is the LEA planning to take to address these areas of low performance and performance gaps? An LEA that is required to include a goal to address one or more consistently low-performing student groups or low-performing schools must identify that it is required to include this goal and must also identify the applicable student group(s) and/or school(s). Other needs may be identified using locally collected data including data collected to inform the self-reflection tools and reporting local indicators on the Dashboard.

### LCAP Highlights
- Identify and briefly summarize the key features of this year’s LCAP.

### Comprehensive Support and Improvement
- An LEA with a school or schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement (CSI) under the Every Student Succeeds Act must respond to the following prompts:
  - **Schools Identified:** Identify the schools within the LEA that have been identified for CSI.
  - **Support for Identified Schools:** Describe how the LEA has or will support the identified schools in developing CSI plans that included a school-level needs assessment, evidence-based interventions, and the identification of any resource inequities to be addressed through the implementation of the CSI plan.
  - **Monitoring and Evaluating Effectiveness:** Describe how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the CSI plan to support student and school improvement. 

## Engaging Educational Partners
Page 87 of 106
<!-- Page 187 -->
![Purpose](https://www.cde.ca.gov/re/lc/)

**Purpose**  
Significant and purposeful engagement of parents, students, educators, and other educational partners, including those representing the student groups identified by LCFF, is critical to the development of the LCAP and the budget process. Consistent with statute, such engagement should support comprehensive strategic planning, accountability, and improvement across the state priorities and locally identified priorities (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Engagement of educational partners is an ongoing, annual process.

This section is designed to reflect how the engagement of educational partners influenced the decisions reflected in the adopted LCAP. The goal is to allow educational partners that participated in the LCAP development process and the broader public understand how the LEA engaged educational partners and the impact of that engagement. LEAs are encouraged to keep this goal in the forefront when completing this section.

Statute and regulations specify the educational partners that school districts and COEs must consult when developing the LCAP: teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, local bargaining units of the LEA, parents, and students. Before adopting the LCAP, school districts and COEs must share it with the Parent Advisory Committee and, if applicable, to its English Learner Parent Advisory Committee. The superintendent is required by statute to respond in writing to the comments received from these committees. School districts and COEs must also consult with the special education local plan area administrator(s) when developing the LCAP.

Statute requires charter schools to consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, parents, and students in developing the LCAP. The LCAP should also be shared with, and LEAs should request input from, schoolsite-level advisory groups, as applicable (e.g., schoolsite councils, English Learner Advisory Councils, student advisory groups, etc.), to facilitate alignment between schoolsite and district-level goals and actions.

Information and resources that support effective engagement, define student consultation, and provide the requirements for advisory group composition, can be found under Resources on the following web page of the CDE’s website: [CDE Resources](https://www.cde.ca.gov/re/lc/).

**Requirements and Instructions**  
Below is an excerpt from the 2018–19 Guide for Annual Audits of K–12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, which is provided to highlight the legal requirements for engagement of educational partners in the LCAP development process:

**Local Control and Accountability Plan:**  
For county offices of education and school districts only, verify the LEA:

a) Presented the local control and accountability plan to the parent advisory committee in accordance with Education Code section 52062(a)(1) or 52068(a)(1), as appropriate.

b) If applicable, presented the local control and accountability plan to the English learner parent advisory committee, in accordance with Education Code section 52062(a)(2) or 52068(a)(2), as appropriate.  

---

**Page 88 of 106**  
**3-24 Local Control Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District**
<!-- Page 188 -->
c) Notified members of the public of the opportunity to submit comments regarding specific actions and expenditures proposed to be included in the local control and accountability plan in accordance with Education Code section 52062(a)(3) or 52068(a)(3), as appropriate.

d) Held at least one public hearing in accordance with Education Code section 52062(b)(1) or 52068(b)(1), as appropriate.

e) Adopted the local control and accountability plan in a public meeting in accordance with Education Code section 52062(b)(2) or 52068(b)(2), as appropriate.

**Prompt 1:** “A summary of the process used to engage educational partners and how this engagement was considered before finalizing the LCAP.”  
Describe the engagement process used by the LEA to involve educational partners in the development of the LCAP, including, at a minimum, describing how the LEA met its obligation to consult with all statutorily required educational partners as applicable to the type of LEA. A sufficient response to this prompt must include general information about the timeline of the process and meetings or other engagement strategies with educational partners. A response may also include information about an LEA’s philosophical approach to engaging its educational partners.

**Prompt 2:** “A summary of the feedback provided by specific educational partners.”  
Describe and summarize the feedback provided by specific educational partners. A sufficient response to this prompt will indicate ideas, trends, or inputs that emerged from an analysis of the feedback received from educational partners.

**Prompt 3:** “A description of the aspects of the LCAP that were influenced by specific input from educational partners.”  
A sufficient response to this prompt will provide educational partners and the public with clear, specific information about how the engagement process influenced the development of the LCAP. The response must describe aspects of the LCAP that were influenced by or developed in response to the educational partner feedback described in response to Prompt 2. This may include a description of how the LEA prioritized requests of educational partners within the context of the budgetary resources available or otherwise prioritized areas of focus within the LCAP. For the purposes of this prompt, “aspects” of an LCAP that may have been influenced by educational partner input can include, but are not necessarily limited to:
- Inclusion of a goal or decision to pursue a Focus Goal (as described below)
- Inclusion of metrics other than the statutorily required metrics
- Determination of the desired outcome on one or more metrics
- Inclusion of performance by one or more student groups in the Measuring and Reporting Results subsection
- Inclusion of action(s) or a group of actions
- Elimination of action(s) or group of actions
- Changes to the level of proposed expenditures for one or more actions

Page 89 of 106  
**24 Local Control Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District**
<!-- Page 189 -->
- Inclusion of action(s) as contributing to increased or improved services for unduplicated services
- Determination of effectiveness of the specific actions to achieve the goal
- Determination of material differences in expenditures
- Determination of changes made to a goal for the ensuing LCAP year based on the annual update process
- Determination of challenges or successes in the implementation of actions

## Goals and Actions

### Purpose
Well-developed goals will clearly communicate to educational partners what the LEA plans to accomplish, what the LEA plans to do in order to accomplish the goal, and how the LEA will know when it has accomplished the goal. A goal statement, associated metrics and expected outcomes, and the actions included in the goal should be in alignment. The explanation for why the LEA included a goal is an opportunity for LEAs to clearly communicate to educational partners and the public why, among the various strengths and areas for improvement highlighted by performance data and strategies and actions that could be pursued, the LEA decided to pursue this goal, and the related metrics, expected outcomes, actions, and expenditures.

A well-developed goal can be focused on the performance relative to a metric or metrics for all students, a specific student group(s), narrowing performance gaps, or implementing programs or strategies expected to impact outcomes. LEAs should assess the performance of their student groups when developing goals and the related actions to achieve such goals.

### Requirements and Instructions
LEAs should prioritize the goals, specific actions, and related expenditures included within the LCAP within one or more state priorities. LEAs should consider performance on the state and local indicators, including their locally collected and reported data for the local indicators that are included in the Dashboard in determining whether and how to prioritize its goals within the LCAP.

In order to support prioritization of goals, the LCAP template provides LEAs with the option of developing three different kinds of goals:

- **Focus Goal:** A Focus Goal is relatively more concentrated in scope and may focus on a fewer number of metrics to measure improvement. A Focus Goal statement will be time bound and make clear how the goal is to be measured.

- **Broad Goal:** A Broad Goal is relatively less concentrated in its scope and may focus on improving performance across a wide range of metrics.

- **Maintenance of Progress Goal:** A Maintenance of Progress Goal includes actions that may be ongoing without significant changes and allows an LEA to track performance on any metrics not addressed in the other goals of the LCAP.

At a minimum, the LCAP must address all LCFF priorities and associated metrics.
<!-- Page 190 -->
![Focus Goal(s)](https://www.cde.ca.gov/fq/aa/lc/)

**Focus Goal(s)**  
**Goal Description:** The description provided for a Focus Goal must be specific, measurable, and time bound. An LEA develops a Focus Goal to address areas of need that may require or benefit from a more specific and data intensive approach. The Focus Goal can explicitly reference the metric(s) by which achievement of the goal will be measured and the time frame according to which the LEA expects to achieve the goal.

**Explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal:** Explain why the LEA has chosen to prioritize this goal. An explanation must be based on Dashboard data or other locally collected data. LEAs must describe how the LEA identified this goal for focused attention, including relevant consultation with educational partners. LEAs are encouraged to promote transparency and understanding around the decision to pursue a focus goal.

**Broad Goal**  
**Goal Description:** Describe what the LEA plans to achieve through the actions included in the goal. The description of a broad goal will be clearly aligned with the expected measurable outcomes included for the goal. The goal description organizes the actions and expected outcomes in a cohesive and consistent manner. A goal description is specific enough to be measurable in either quantitative or qualitative terms. A broad goal is not as specific as a focus goal. While it is specific enough to be measurable, there are many different metrics for measuring progress toward the goal.

**Explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal:** Explain why the LEA developed this goal and how the actions and metrics grouped together will help achieve the goal.

**Maintenance of Progress Goal**  
**Goal Description:** Describe how the LEA intends to maintain the progress made in the LCFF State Priorities not addressed by the other goals in the LCAP. Use this type of goal to address the state priorities and applicable metrics not addressed within the other goals in the LCAP. The state priorities and metrics to be addressed in this section are those for which the LEA, in consultation with educational partners, has determined to maintain actions and monitor progress while focusing implementation efforts on the actions covered by other goals in the LCAP.

**Explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal:** Explain how the actions will sustain the progress exemplified by the related metrics.

**Required Goals**  
In general, LEAs have flexibility in determining what goals to include in the LCAP and what those goals will address; however, beginning with the development of the 2022–23 LCAP, LEAs that meet certain criteria are required to include a specific goal in their LCAP.

**Consistently low-performing student group(s) criteria:** An LEA is eligible for Differentiated Assistance for three or more consecutive years based on the performance of the same student group or groups in the Dashboard. A list of the LEAs required to include a goal in the LCAP based on student group performance, and the student group(s) that led to identification, may be found on the CDE’s Local Control Funding Formula web page at [https://www.cde.ca.gov/fq/aa/lc/](https://www.cde.ca.gov/fq/aa/lc/).

**Consistently low-performing student group(s) goal requirement:** An LEA meeting the consistently low-performing student group(s) criteria must include a goal in its LCAP focused on improving the performance of the student group or groups that led to the LEA’s eligibility for Differentiated Assistance.

**Assistance:** This goal must include metrics, outcomes, actions, and expenditures specific to addressing the needs of, and improving outcomes for, this student group or groups. An LEA required to address multiple student groups is not required to have a goal to address each student group; however, each student group must be specifically addressed in the goal. This requirement may not be met by combining this required goal with another goal.

- **Goal Description:** Describe the outcomes the LEA plans to achieve to address the needs of, and improve outcomes for, the student group or groups that led to the LEA's eligibility for Differentiated Assistance.

- **Explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal:** Explain why the LEA is required to develop this goal, including identifying the student group(s) that lead to the LEA being required to develop this goal, how the actions and associated metrics included in this goal differ from previous efforts to improve outcomes for the student group(s), and why the LEA believes the actions, metrics, and expenditures included in this goal will help achieve the outcomes identified in the goal description.

**Low-performing school(s) criteria:** The following criteria only applies to a school district or COE with two or more schools; it does not apply to a single-school district. A school district or COE has one or more schools that, for two consecutive years, received the two lowest performance levels on all but one of the state indicators for which the school(s) receive performance levels in the Dashboard and the performance of the “All Students” student group for the LEA is at least one performance level higher in all of those indicators. A list of the LEAs required to include a goal in the LCAP based on school performance, and the school(s) that lead to identification, may be found on the CDE’s Local Control Funding Formula web page at [CDE LCAP](https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/lc/).

- **Low-performing school(s) goal requirement:** A school district or COE meeting the low-performing school(s) criteria must include a goal in its LCAP focusing on addressing the disparities in performance between the school(s) and the LEA as a whole. This goal must include metrics, outcomes, actions, and expenditures specific to addressing the needs of, and improving outcomes for, the students enrolled at the low-performing school or schools. An LEA required to address multiple schools is not required to have a goal to address each school; however, each school must be specifically addressed in the goal. This requirement may not be met by combining this goal with another goal.

- **Goal Description:** Describe what outcomes the LEA plans to achieve to address the disparities in performance between the students enrolled at the low-performing school(s) and the students enrolled at the LEA as a whole.

- **Explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal:** Explain why the LEA is required to develop this goal, including identifying the schools(s) that lead to the LEA being required to develop this goal; how the actions and associated metrics included in this goal differ from previous efforts to improve outcomes for the school(s); and why the LEA believes the actions, metrics, and expenditures included in this goal will help achieve the outcomes for students enrolled at the low-performing school or schools identified in the goal description.

**Measuring and Reporting Results:**  
For each LCAP year, identify the metric(s) that the LEA will use to track progress toward the expected outcomes. LEAs are encouraged to identify metrics for specific student groups, as appropriate, including expected outcomes that would reflect narrowing of any existing performance gaps.

The metrics may be quantitative or qualitative; but at minimum, an LEA's LCAP must include goals that are measured using all of the applicable metrics for the related state priorities, in each LCAP year as applicable to the type of LEA. To the extent a state priority does not specify one or more metrics (e.g., implementation of state academic content and performance standards), the LEA must identify a metric to use within the LCAP. For these state priorities, LEAs are encouraged to use metrics based on or reported through the relevant self-reflection tool for local indicators within the Dashboard.

**Actions:** Enter the action number. Provide a short title for the action. This title will also appear in the action tables. Provide a description of the action. Enter the total amount of expenditures associated with this action. Budgeted expenditures from specific fund sources will be provided in the summary tables. Indicate whether the action contributes to meeting the increase or improved services requirement as described in the Increased or Improved Services section using a “Y” for Yes or an “N” for No. (Note: for each action offered on an LEA-wide or schoolwide basis, the LEA will need to provide additional information in the Increased or Improved Summary Section to address the requirements in California Code of Regulations, Title 5 [5 CCR] Section 15496(b) in the Increased or Improved Services Section of the LCAP).

**Actions for English Learners:** School districts, COEs, and charter schools that have a numerically significant English learner student subgroup must include specific actions in the LCAP related to, at a minimum, the language acquisition programs, as defined in EC Section 306, provided to students and professional development activities specific to English learners.

**Actions for Foster Youth:** School districts, COEs, and charter schools that have a numerically significant Foster Youth student subgroup are encouraged to include specific actions in the LCAP designed to meet needs specific to Foster Youth students.

**Goal Analysis:**

Enter the LCAP Year.
<!-- Page 194 -->
Using actual annual measurable outcome data, including data from the Dashboard, analyze whether the planned actions were effective in achieving the goal. Respond to the prompts as instructed.

- Describe the overall implementation of the actions to achieve the articulated goal. Include a discussion of relevant challenges and successes experienced with the implementation process. This must include any instance where the LEA did not implement a planned action or implemented a planned action in a manner that differs substantively from how it was described in the adopted LCAP.

- Explain material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and between the Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services, as applicable. Minor variances in expenditures or percentages do not need to be addressed, and a dollar-for-dollar accounting is not required.

- Describe the effectiveness of the specific actions to achieve the articulated goal as measured by the LEA. In some cases, not all actions in a goal will be intended to improve performance on all of the metrics associated with the goal. When responding to this prompt, LEAs may assess the effectiveness of a single action or group of actions within the goal in the context of performance on a single metric or group of specific metrics within the goal that are applicable to the action(s). Grouping actions with metrics will allow for more robust analysis of whether the strategy the LEA is using to impact a specified set of metrics is working and increase transparency for educational partners. LEAs are encouraged to use such an approach when goals include multiple actions and metrics that are not closely associated.

- Describe any changes made to this goal, expected outcomes, metrics, or actions to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis and analysis of the data provided in the Dashboard or other local data, as applicable.

**Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students**

**Purpose**  
A well-written Increased or Improved Services section provides educational partners with a comprehensive description, within a single dedicated section, of how an LEA plans to increase or improve services for its unduplicated students in grades TK–12 as compared to all students in grades TK–12, as applicable, and how LEA-wide or schoolwide actions identified for this purpose meet regulatory requirements. Descriptions provided should include sufficient detail yet be sufficiently succinct to promote a broader understanding of educational partners to facilitate their ability to provide input. An LEA’s description in this section must align with the actions included in the Goals and Actions section as contributing.

**Requirements and Instructions**  
**Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants:** Specify the amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grant funds the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year based on the number and concentration of low income, foster youth, and English learner students.
<!-- Page 195 -->
![Projected Additional LCFF Concentration Grant (15 percent): Specify the amount of additional LCFF concentration grant add-on funding, as described in EC Section 42238.02, that the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year.](https://example.com/image1)

**Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year:** Specify the estimated percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

**LCFF Carryover — Percentage:** Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

**LCFF Carryover — Dollar:** Specify the LCFF Carryover — Dollar amount identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover amount is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify an amount of zero ($0).

**Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year:** Add the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the Proportional LCFF Required Carryover Percentage and specify the percentage. This is the LEA's percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year, as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

**Required Descriptions:**

For each action being provided to an entire school, or across the entire school district or COE, an explanation of (1) how the needs of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students were considered first, and (2) how these actions are effective in meeting the goals for these students.

For each action included in the Goals and Actions section as contributing to the increased or improved services requirement for unduplicated pupils and provided on an LEA-wide or schoolwide basis, the LEA must include an explanation consistent with 5 CCR Section 15496(b). For any such actions continued into the 2021–24 LCAP from the 2017–2020 LCAP, the LEA must determine whether or not the action was effective as expected, and this determination must reflect evidence of outcome data or actual implementation to date.

**Principally Directed and Effective:** An LEA demonstrates how an action is principally directed towards and effective in meeting the LEA’s goals for unduplicated students when the LEA explains how:

- It considers the needs, conditions, or circumstances of its unduplicated pupils;
- The action, or aspect(s) of the action (including, for example, its design, content, methods, or location), is based on these considerations; and
- The action is intended to help achieve an expected measurable outcome of the associated goal.

As such, the response provided in this section may rely on a needs assessment of unduplicated students.
<!-- Page 196 -->
![Page 97 of 106](https://example.com/image)  
Conclusive statements that a service will help achieve an expected outcome for the goal, without an explicit connection or further explanation as to how, are not sufficient. Further, simply stating that an LEA has a high enrollment percentage of a specific student group or groups does not meet the increase or improve services standard because enrolling students is not the same as serving students.

For example, if an LEA determines that low-income students have a significantly lower attendance rate than the attendance rate for all students, it might justify LEA-wide or schoolwide actions to address this area of need in the following way:

After assessing the needs, conditions, and circumstances of our low-income students, we learned that the attendance rate of our low-income students is 7 percent lower than the attendance rate for all students. (Needs, Conditions, Circumstances [Principally Directed])

In order to address this condition of our low-income students, we will develop and implement a new attendance program that is designed to address some of the major causes of absenteeism, including lack of reliable transportation and food, as well as a school climate that does not emphasize the importance of attendance. Goal N, Actions X, Y, and Z provide additional transportation and nutritional resources as well as a districtwide educational campaign on the benefits of high attendance rates. (Contributing Action[s])

These actions are being provided on an LEA-wide basis and we expect/hope that all students with less than a 100 percent attendance rate will benefit. However, because of the significantly lower attendance rate of low-income students, and because the actions meet needs most associated with the chronic stresses and experiences of a socio-economically disadvantaged status, we expect that the attendance rate for our low-income students will increase significantly more than the average attendance rate of all other students. (Measurable Outcomes [Effective In])

COEs and Charter Schools: Describe how actions included as contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement on an LEA-wide basis are principally directed to and effective in meeting its goals for unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priorities as described above. In the case of COEs and charter schools, schoolwide and LEA-wide are considered to be synonymous.

For School Districts Only:

Actions Provided on an LEA-Wide Basis:

Unduplicated Percentage > 55 percent: For school districts with an unduplicated pupil percentage of 55 percent or more, describe how these actions are principally directed to and effective in meeting its goals for unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priorities as described above.

Unduplicated Percentage < 55 percent: For school districts with an unduplicated pupil percentage of less than 55 percent, describe how these actions are principally directed to and effective in meeting its goals for unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priorities. Also describe how the actions are the most effective use of the funds to meet these goals for its unduplicated pupils. Provide the basis for this determination, including any alternatives considered, supporting research, experience, or educational theory.

Actions Provided on a Schoolwide Basis:  
3-24 Local Control Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District
<!-- Page 197 -->
![Page 98 of 106](https://www.sjusd.org/)

School Districts must identify in the description those actions being funded and provided on a schoolwide basis, and include the required description supporting the use of the funds on a schoolwide basis.

For schools with 40 percent or more enrollment of unduplicated pupils: Describe how these actions are principally directed to and effective in meeting its goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priorities.

For school districts expending funds on a schoolwide basis at a school with less than 40 percent enrollment of unduplicated pupils: Describe how these actions are the most effective use of the funds to meet its goals for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students in the state and any local priorities.

A description of how services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students are being increased or improved by the percentage required.

Consistent with the requirements of 5 CCR Section 15496, describe how services provided for unduplicated pupils are increased or improved by at least the percentage calculated as compared to the services provided for all students in the LCAP year. To improve services means to grow services in quality and to increase services means to grow services in quantity. Services are increased or improved by those actions in the LCAP that are included in the Goals and Actions section as contributing to the increased or improved services requirement, whether they are provided on an LEA-wide or schoolwide basis or provided on a limited basis to unduplicated students. A limited action is an action that only serves foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income students. This description must address how these action(s) are expected to result in the required proportional increase or improvement in services for unduplicated pupils as compared to the services the LEA provides to all students for the relevant LCAP year.

A description of the plan for how the additional concentration grant add-on funding identified above will be used to increase the number of staff providing direct services to students at schools that have a high concentration (above 55 percent) of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students, as applicable.

An LEA that receives the additional concentration grant add-on described in EC Section 42238.02 is required to demonstrate how it is using these funds to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent as compared to the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is equal to or less than 55 percent. The staff who provide direct services to students must be certificated staff and/or classified staff employed by the LEA; classified staff includes custodial staff.

Provide the following descriptions, as applicable to the LEA:
<!-- Page 198 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

An LEA that does not receive a concentration grant or the concentration grant add-on must indicate that a response to this prompt is not applicable.

Identify the goal and action numbers of the actions in the LCAP that the LEA is implementing to meet the requirement to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

An LEA that does not have comparison schools from which to describe how it is using the concentration grant add-on funds, such as an LEA that only has schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, must describe how it is using the funds to increase the number of credentialed staff, classified staff, or both, including custodial staff, who provide direct services to students at selected schools and the criteria used to determine which schools require additional staffing support.

In the event that an additional concentration grant add-on is not sufficient to increase staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, the LEA must describe how it is using the funds to retain staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

Complete the table as follows:

- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA. The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA. The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of full time equivalent (FTE) staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.

- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA. The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA. The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of FTE staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.

**Action Tables**

Complete the Data Entry Table for each action in the LCAP. The information entered into this table will automatically populate the other Action Tables. Information is only entered into the Data Entry Table, the Annual Update Table, the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, and the LCFF Carryover Table. With the exception of the Data Entry Table, the word “input” has been added to column headers to aid in identifying the column(s) where information will be entered. Information is not entered on the remaining Action tables.

The following tables are required to be included as part of the LCAP adopted by the local governing board or governing body:

- **Table 1: Total Planned Expenditures Table (for the coming LCAP Year)**

- Table 3: Annual Update Table (for the current LCAP Year)
- Table 4: Contributing Actions Annual Update Table (for the current LCAP Year)
- Table 5: LCFF Carryover Table (for the current LCAP Year)

Note: The coming LCAP Year is the year that is being planned for, while the current LCAP year is the current year of implementation. For example, when developing the 2022–23 LCAP, 2022–23 will be the coming LCAP Year and 2021–22 will be the current LCAP Year.

## Data Entry Table
The Data Entry Table may be included in the LCAP as adopted by the local governing board or governing body, but is not required to be included. In the Data Entry Table, input the following information for each action in the LCAP for that applicable LCAP year:

- **LCAP Year:** Identify the applicable LCAP Year.
  
- **1. Projected LCFF Base Grant:** Provide the total amount of LCFF funding the LEA estimates it will receive for the coming school year, excluding the supplemental and concentration grants and the add-ons for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Grant Program and the Home to School Transportation Program, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8).
  
  See EC sections 2574 (for COEs) and 42238.02 (for school districts and charter schools), as applicable, for LCFF apportionment calculations.

- **2. Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants:** Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants the LEA estimates it will receive on the basis of the number and concentration of unduplicated students for the coming school year.

- **3. Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year:** This percentage will not be entered; it is calculated based on the Projected LCFF Base Grant and the Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the coming LCAP year.

- **LCFF Carryover — Percentage:** Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table from the prior LCAP year. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

- **Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year:** This percentage will not be entered; it is calculated based on the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the LCFF Carryover —
<!-- Page 200 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Percentage. This is the percentage by which the LEA must increase or improve services for unduplicated pupils as compared to the services provided to all students in the coming LCAP year.

- **Goal #:** Enter the LCAP Goal number for the action.
- **Action #:** Enter the action’s number as indicated in the LCAP Goal.
- **Action Title:** Provide a title of the action.
- **Student Group(s):** Indicate the student group or groups who will be the primary beneficiary of the action by entering “All,” or by entering a specific student group or groups.
- **Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?:** Type “Yes” if the action is included as contributing to meeting the increased or improved services; OR, type “No” if the action is not included as contributing to meeting the increased or improved services.
- If “Yes” is entered into the Contributing column, then complete the following columns:
  - **Scope:** The scope of an action may be LEA-wide (i.e., districtwide, countywide, or charterwide), schoolwide, or limited. An action that is LEA-wide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of the LEA. An action that is schoolwide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of a single school. An action that is limited in its scope is an action that serves only one or more unduplicated student groups.
  - **Unduplicated Student Group(s):** Regardless of scope, contributing actions serve one or more unduplicated student groups. Indicate one or more unduplicated student groups for whom services are being increased or improved as compared to what all students receive.
  - **Location:** Identify the location where the action will be provided. If the action is provided to all schools within the LEA, the LEA must indicate “All Schools.” If the action is provided to specific schools within the LEA or specific grade spans only, the LEA must enter “Specific Schools” or “Specific Grade Spans.” Identify the individual school or a subset of schools or grade spans (e.g., all high schools or grades transitional kindergarten through grade five), as appropriate.
  - **Time Span:** Enter “ongoing” if the action will be implemented for an indeterminate period of time. Otherwise, indicate the span of time for which the action will be implemented. For example, an LEA might enter “1 Year,” or “2 Years,” or “6 Months.”
  - **Total Personnel:** Enter the total amount of personnel expenditures utilized to implement this action.
  - **Total Non-Personnel:** This amount will be automatically calculated based on information provided in the Total Personnel column and the Total Funds column.

Page 101 of 106
<!-- Page 201 -->
- **LCFF Funds**: Enter the total amount of LCFF funds utilized to implement this action, if any. LCFF funds include all funds that make up an LEA's total LCFF target (i.e., base grant, grade span adjustment, supplemental grant, concentration grant, Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant, and Home-To-School Transportation).
  - **Note**: For an action to contribute towards meeting the increased or improved services requirement it must include some measure of LCFF funding. The action may also include funding from other sources, however the extent to which an action contributes to meeting the increased or improved services requirement is based on the LCFF funding being used to implement the action.

- **Other State Funds**: Enter the total amount of Other State Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

- **Local Funds**: Enter the total amount of Local Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

- **Federal Funds**: Enter the total amount of Federal Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

- **Total Funds**: This amount is automatically calculated based on amounts entered in the previous four columns.

- **Planned Percentage of Improved Services**: For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the planned quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%). A limited action is an action that only serves foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income students.
  - **Note**: As noted in the instructions for the Increased or Improved Services section, when identifying a Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA must describe the methodology that it used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. The percentage of improved services for an action corresponds to the amount of LCFF funding that the LEA estimates it would expend to implement the action if it were funded.

  - For example, an LEA determines that there is a need to analyze data to ensure that instructional aides and expanded learning providers know what targeted supports to provide to students who are foster youth. The LEA could implement this action by hiring additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students, which the LEA estimates would cost $165,000. Instead, the LEA chooses to utilize a portion of existing staff time to analyze data relating to students who are foster youth. This analysis will then be shared with site principals who will use the data to coordinate services provided by instructional assistants and expanded learning providers to target support to students. In this example, the LEA would divide the estimated cost of $165,000 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Planned Percentage of Improved Service for the action.

**Contributing Actions Table**

As noted above, information will not be entered in the Contributing Actions Table; however, the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column will need to be checked to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses.

## Annual Update Table
In the Annual Update Table, provide the following information for each action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditures to implement this action, if any.

## Contributing Actions Annual Update Table
In the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, check the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses. Provide the following information for each contributing action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

- **6. Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants:** Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants the LEA estimates it will actually receive based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the current school year.

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditure of LCFF funds used to implement this action, if any.

- **Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services:** For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis only to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the total estimated actual quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%).

  - Building on the example provided above for calculating the Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA in the example implements the action. As part of the annual update process, the LEA reviews implementation and student outcome data and determines that the action was implemented with fidelity and that outcomes for both students improved. The LEA reviews the original estimated cost for the action and determines that it had hired additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students that estimated actual cost would have been $169,500 due to a cost of living adjustment. The LEA would divide the estimated actual cost of $169,500 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

## LCFF Carryover Table
- **9. Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant:** Provide the total amount of LCFF funding the LEA estimates it will receive for the current school year, excluding the supplemental and concentration grants and the add-ons for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Grant Program and the Home to School Transportation Program, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8).

- 10. Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Current School Year: This percentage will not be entered. The percentage is calculated based on the amounts of the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9) and the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants (6), pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8), plus the LCFF Carryover – Percentage from the prior year. This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the current LCAP year.

## Calculations in the Action Tables
To reduce the duplication of effort of LEAs, the Action Tables include functionality such as pre-population of fields and cells based on the information provided in the Data Entry Table, the Annual Update Summary Table, and the Contributing Actions Table. For transparency, the functionality and calculations used are provided below.

### Contributing Actions Table
- **4. Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (LCFF Funds)**
  - This amount is the total of the Planned Expenditures for Contributing Actions (LCFF Funds) column.

- **5. Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services**
  - This percentage is the total of the Planned Percentage of Improved Services column.

- **Planned Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the coming school year**
  - This percentage is calculated by dividing the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) by the Projected LCFF Base Grant (1), converting the quotient to a percentage, and adding it to the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5).

### Contributing Actions Annual Update Table
Pursuant to EC Section 42238.07(c)(2), if the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) is less than the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants (6), the LEA is required to calculate the difference between the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5) and the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (7). If the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) is equal to or greater than the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants (6), the Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services will display “Not Required.”

- **6. Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants**
  - This is the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants the LEA estimates it will actually receive based on of the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the current school year.

- **4. Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (LCFF Funds)**
  - This amount is the total of the Last Year's Planned Expenditures for Contributing Actions (LCFF Funds).

- Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services
  - This amount is the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5) subtracted from the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (8)

LCFF Carryover Table
- 10. Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Current School Year
  - This percentage is the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants (6) divided by the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9) plus the LCFF Carryover – Percentage from the prior year.
  
- 11. Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services
  - This percentage is the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (7) divided by the LCFF Funding (9), then converting the quotient to a percentage and adding the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (8).
  
- 12. LCFF Carryover — Dollar Amount LCFF Carryover
  - If the Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (11) is less than the Estimated Actual Percentage to Increase or Improve Services (10), the LEA is required to carry over LCFF funds.

The amount of LCFF funds is calculated by subtracting the Estimated Actual Percentage to Increase or Improve Services (11) from the Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (10) and then multiplying by the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9). This amount is the amount of LCFF funds that is required to be carried over to the coming year.
<!-- Page 205 -->
- 13. LCFF Carryover — Percentage (12 divided by 9)
  - This percentage is the unmet portion of the Percentage to Increase or Improve Services that the LEA must carry over into the coming LCAP year. The percentage is calculated by dividing the LCFF Carryover (12) by the LCFF Funding (9).

# Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP)  
## 2022-23 Educational Partner Engagement Overview  

The Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) is a three-year plan that is revised annually and describes how services will be provided to improve student outcomes especially for our English learner, low-income, and foster youth students.  

The LCAP is organized around four goals focused on addressing students’ academic, social, emotional, and mental needs. These goals include:  
- Connected School Communities  
- Healthy Environments for Social and Emotional Growth  
- Engaging Academic Programs  
- Clear Pathways to Bright Futures  

The LCAP is also developed with, and includes the perspectives and insights of, our educational partners including our students, families, staff, and community. Educational partners were engaged using various outreach and communication strategies in order to differentiate our approach and maximize participation, especially for our targeted groups. This included:  
- Thought Exchanges, listening sessions, focus groups, and surveys  
- Meeting with partners in 1:1, small group, large group, online, and in person  
- Communicating with our educational partners via website, mass notification, social media, community newsletters, and targeted outreach  

Educational partners were asked to consider what our schools are doing well to support students and families, as well as what our schools can do differently and focus on in order to improve. Educational partner input was then reviewed within and across groups for common themes to identify both districtwide and student group specific needs.  

Collectively, educational partner input, the eight state priority areas, state and local indicators, and LCAP metrics were analyzed and used to revise existing LCAP actions, develop new actions, and target funds strategically to reflect the voice and needs of our entire San Juan community.

| 1  | DELAC     | Goal 2 mentions, "inclusive and culturally responsive textbooks." Could you explain what type of textbooks this is referring to?                                                                      | The Professional Learning and Innovation (PLI) department that oversees curriculum, continually works to ensure that all of our instructional materials accurately and thoroughly represent the rich diversity of our community, selecting materials that include the breadth of human experiences and identities.                                                                 |
| 2  | DELAC     | Goal 4 refers to various programs (AVID, CTE, IYT, etc.) that are available. How soon can a newcomer/English learner take advantage of these programs? Is there a certain level of English that is required for a student to be successful or are these dual language programs? | English learners, or emerging bilingual students, are encouraged to take advantage of programs such as Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID), Improve Your Tomorrow (IYT) and Career Technical Education (CTE) as soon as they become interested. AVID programs are a great support to English learners and many of our emerging bilingual students partake in AVID. There is no level of English required for students to enroll in these programs. The only class that pertains to English language proficiency is English Language Development (ELD) which is a federal requirement for all students on the path to mastering reading, writing, listening, and speaking English. |
| 3  | DELAC     | • How many post their School Site Council meeting calendar on their school website? <br> • How many post their School Site Council minutes on their school website? <br> • How many post their School Site Council representatives on their school website? | Historically, School Site Council (SSC) minutes have been available upon request to accommodate translation. While not a requirement, sites are encouraged to post SSC calendar and minutes on their websites. SSC members are recorded in each site’s School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) and publicly available on the district and school websites. Inclusion of information on SSC is part of the standard website template. Specific information posted will vary by site. For example, some sites choose to share information via their school newsletter. Information about School Site Councils is typically found under the “Our School” menu on a school website and is accessible to members of the public. |

|---|---|---|
| 4 | LCAP PAC | How is information regarding school site councils being communicated to the community? |
|   |   | School websites can be found by visiting www.sanjuan.edu and selecting the school(s) of interest from the “Our Schools” menu located at the top of the page. School Site Council (SSC) Training modules are made available to site administrators, as requested. Staff from the Office of Student Learning also provides School Site Council informational sessions for requesting sites. Translation is available. |
| 5 | LCAP PAC | How are our LCAP goals developed and what measurements are we using for accountability? |
|   |   | LCAP goals were developed to focus the district’s continuous improvement work and developed with our educational partners as part of our strategic planning process during the 2019-20 school year. Each goal is aligned and in response to the state and local Dashboard data areas, and reflective of the shared interests within and across educational partner groups. Each School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) is aligned to the LCAP goals. Sites identify specific metrics to monitor progress toward goals using state, local and site data. Sites leaders document progress toward goals in the Analysis section of the SPSA template. Performance will be measured using multiple metrics listed in the Measuring and Reporting Results section of each goal using the 3-year desired outcomes listed for each metric to monitor progress and improvement. |
| 6 | LCAP PAC | What are we doing in San Juan to retain teachers of color? |
|   |   | San Juan established Cultivating Leaders, which provides mentorship and professional development to teachers who aspire to be administrators. Additionally, the Alder Teacher Residency takes place in partnership with K-12. |

| 7 | LCAP PAC | What incentive programs do we have in San Juan to help move classified staff to certificated staff? San Juan offers the Teacher Residency Program to district staff for the first two rounds before moving to external candidates. Human Resources (HR) also provides information sessions assisting classified employees on how to transition to certificated employees, and there are currently a number of state incentives such as the Golden State Teaching Grant that we share. Finally, there is additional Side Letter Agreement language to support classified teachers in being substitute teachers. |
| 8 | LCAP PAC | Can we look at transportation to summer programs for students with disabilities? Transportation is a related service specific to extended school year (ESY) for those students who require ESY based on their Individualized Education Program (IEP). |
| 9 | LCAP PAC | It is difficult to get a general education teacher at IEP meetings. Often one is not present or leaves the meeting early. The requirement is not less than one general education teacher is present for an IEP meeting for students participating in general education classrooms. If the general education teacher is not present or has to leave the meeting early, the parent has the right to request that the meeting be recessed and rescheduled to a later date. Another option is to allow for the general education teacher to provide their report during the time they are available in the meeting and then agree to continue the meeting in the absence of the general education teacher. |
| 10 | LCAP PAC | Please provide many or complete examples of budgetary expenditures in a few different categories? 2.5, 3.10, 4.10 LCAP Action 2.5: Safety, Security, Planning, and Training • 9 Community Safety Specialists • Support sites with development, implementation and training of site safety plans and behavior response plans |

**11 LCAP PAC**
**What funds go directly to the Community/Educational Partners?**
San Juan enters into contracts for specific services and programs with community partners. Funding for community partnerships comes from a variety of funding streams including Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) Supplemental, Title I, Expanded Learning Opportunities Grant (ELO), and Elementary and Secondary Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER). These funds are disbursed to community partners based on needs identified at the school and district level through a collaborative process that includes educational partner input.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| **12** | **LCAP PAC** | Who ensures School Site Council rules and standards are being met? |
|   |   | School Site Council (SSC) is regulated by Educational Code under the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). The Title I Program Manager provides training and guidance to principals to ensure that they are aware of the rules and standards for SSC, including composition and involvement, are followed. Site plans are reviewed for educational partner engagement, SSC composition and approval. In addition, the site supervisors including Elementary and Secondary directors support principals with involving educational partners in the process. San Juan Teachers Association provides training to teachers representatives around their role on SSC. <br><br> Finally, the California Department of Education conducts Federal Program Monitoring (FPM) accountability checks every other year. During the FPM Review, random sites are chosen and examined for compliance around SSC elections, composition, and involvement. The 2022-23 FPM review included 9 randomly selected Title I school sites. All documentation of SSC was required to be submitted to the reviewers. Additionally, site visits were conducted at each site and each SSC was interviewed. The FPM review resulted in 100% compliance with SSC mandates. |
| **13** | **LCAP PAC** | What are the names of the training programs available or mandated and where can they be found in the budget and what are the names of the parent companies? |
|   |   | Available training opportunities in San Juan are optional to meet the diverse needs of school sites across our district. San Juan staff often provide the training and are funded using a variety of funding sources including Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) Base and Supplemental, Expanded Learning Opportunities Grant (ELO), and Elementary and Secondary Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER). For example, training provided by Coordinators, Trauma Informed Schools include: <br> • A Trauma-Informed Perspective <br> • The Regulated Classroom <br> • Trauma-Informed Teaching <br> • Trauma-Informed Environmental Design |

# LCFF Budget Overview for Parents

The LCFF gives school districts more flexibility in deciding how to use state funds. In exchange, school districts must work with parents, educators, students, and the community to develop a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) that shows how they will use these funds to serve students.

### Plan Summary 2022-23

#### General Information
A description of the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades transitional kindergarten–12, as applicable to the LEA.

Choices Charter School (“CCS” or “Choices”) is a 6-12 Independent Study School that involves parents/guardians as partners in the education of their children. A highly qualified and dedicated faculty educates a diverse population of students, with the great majority being at some level of academic risk (“at-risk” students). Choices students typically attend small classes and/or meet with a faculty member in a one-on-one setting for one to six hours each week. Class attendance is not generally required; however, attendance is based on the completion of assigned work. Students accomplish much of their learning through assignments that are completed independently, most of which are available online, under the supervision of parents/guardians, while they are at home. Founded in 1999, the school’s charter was renewed in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019 for five-year terms. A two-year extension on all charters was granted due to the COVID-19 pandemic; Choices’ charter will be eligible for renewal in 2026. CCS is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC).

Within the Charter Schools Act, the “at-risk” student is defined as “a pupil who, because of physical, emotional, socioeconomic, or cultural factors, is less likely to succeed in a conventional educational environment.” The expression “at-risk,” when referring to CCS students, encompasses a wide range of academic challenges; some students are simply not reaching their greatest academic potential in the traditional school format, while others are failing and/or at risk of dropping out of school altogether. CCS serves at-risk students with the belief that all students, given the appropriate conditions and tools, can succeed and be educated, contributing members of society. CCS is committed to providing students and parents with educational alternatives not readily available in the traditional public school environment.

The primary goal of CCS is to offer personalized educational alternatives organized around how students learn best. Due to small class sizes and one-on-one instruction, CCS students and faculty members work together in a meaningful way to address individual students’ needs and to work effectively with students’ learning styles and strengths. CCS teachers utilize subject-specific diagnostic, formative, and summative assessment data to identify what students have learned and to re-teach to fill the identified gaps in knowledge. Teachers then customize curriculum and instruction to fit the needs of the individual, while encouraging all students to utilize and build upon their strengths, in order to meet grade-level standards and progress toward graduation. Teachers engage students in the learning process by providing relevant and memorable online and classroom learning experiences that involve collaborative conversation among classmates as they seek solutions to academic prompts/problems. Honors and Advanced Placement courses are offered to students who qualify for more challenging academic course work. Remedial courses and modified assignments provide extra help in target areas for students who struggle. A-G coursework, dual

enrollment at community colleges, a Career Technical Education (“CTE”) Pathway in Business & Finance, and two World Language tracks that lead to blitery support students as they become college and career ready. A variety of elective courses - offered both online and in the classroom setting - provide students with the opportunity to earn credits while exploring individual interests and developing life skills. CCS’s personalized educational environment builds students’ confidence, interpersonal skills, commitment to school, and engagement in learning, which leads to the accomplishment of high academic standards.

One of CCS’s greatest strengths in educating students lies with the program and faculty’s ability to rehabilitate learners who have lost both confidence in themselves as students and motivation to excel academically. CCS students typically re-engage in their education while at Choices, thanks to the guidance and encouragement of faculty members who meet them where they are and help them to experience incremental academic successes that build confidence and promote a sense of pride in their accomplishments. Students feel they are both seen and respected at CCS and thrive both academically and socially in a safe environment where student misbehavior and bullying are virtually nonexistent. CCS students come to feel empowered and optimistic about education and about their ability to reach academic goals and make positive changes in their lives.

Once students find success with their academics at CCS, they are supported in their decision to remain at Choices for the duration of their middle school and/or high school careers or to return to the traditional school environment. The CCS Staff facilitates students’ return to traditional schools if and when they are ready. This has a negative effect on test scores and data but shows that CCS’s highest priority is to help students to get back on track with their education. Students who remain at Choices are provided a breadth of courses, field trips and extracurricular opportunities, a supportive staff, and individualized counseling, all designed to prepare students for post-secondary academic and/or professional pursuits. One hundred percent of 2022 graduates stated that they would recommend the program to other students. Thirty-four percent of the graduates stated that they would not have graduated from high school if they had not attended CCS. Fifty-seven percent of those graduates planned to attend college or trade school in the coming year.

Reflections: Successes  
A description of successes and/or progress based on a review of the California School Dashboard (Dashboard) and local data.

Though 2023 data is not yet available, Choices Charter School is extremely proud of its students’ progress in academic achievement, college and career readiness, and emotional well-being, which is demonstrated by data from 2022 and previous recent years. Due to small sample sizes, to protect the privacy of individual students, data results for English Learners (6%) and Foster Youth (1%) are typically not reported publicly; most data highlighted here focuses on the successes of All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students (46%).

Thanks to the staff’s dedication to continuous program improvement, combined with a seamless transition to COVID-19 Distance Learning, supported by standards-based online curriculum, online instruction, and augmented outreach to families, Choices has made notable recent progress in the following areas, in spite of unprecedented challenging circumstances:

- **Graduation Rate:** The Graduation Rates of All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students grew in 2020, 2021, and 2022. The Graduation Rates of each group have remained nearly equal or equal (2022) to one another, demonstrating equity of the Choices.  
Page 7 of 66  
266
<!-- Page 267 -->
![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+B)

- **CAASPP (ELA SBA, Math SBA, and Science CAST)**: In 2021, disadvantaged student subgroups exceeded the proficiency of All Students in almost all categories. Rates of proficiency fell in all subjects, for all student groups, in 2022. Disadvantaged student subgroups lagged behind All Students in ELA and Math. However, “Ever-EL” English Learners lagged by very little in both subjects. In Science, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students outperformed All Students, while “Ever-EL” English Learners performed less well. SBA and CAST performance and achievement gaps between All Students and disadvantaged student subgroups have fluctuated over time. Due to small sample sizes, statistics often change significantly from year to year. Multiple years of data are studied to identify trends. Significant gains in proficiency by all student groups in 2021 seemed to suggest that the modified, shorter SBA exams given in 2021 were less challenging than the standard version that was administered in 2019. However, State of California data shows that students of all subgroups experienced declines in performance, on average, across the state in 2021. In fact, Choices students not only improved in 2021; they significantly outperformed the state proficiency rates in nearly all categories. Choices students may have fared better than most students in the state, due to consistency in curriculum and instruction and dedicated outreach to families throughout 2020 and 2021. Whereas traditional schools often struggled to adjust to distance learning conditions, Choices was able to transition nearly seamlessly. Most rates of proficiency dropped between 2021 and 2022 for both Choices and the State of California. However, in most cases, Choices students in all student groups have outperformed state averages in both years.

- **College Career Indicator**: The College Career Indicator (“CCI”) of Choices graduates has grown steadily in recent years. The CCI for both All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students grew in 2020. Thanks to a growing focus on Choices’ college and career readiness opportunities, such as A-G courses, dual enrollment at community colleges, a Career Technical Education Pathway in Business & Finance, and two World Language tracks that lead to biliteracy, more Choices students are considered “Prepared” for college and career each year.

- **Student Anxiety Levels (School Satisfaction Survey)**: While the percentage of new students reporting that “social/other anxiety” was a primary reason for enrolling at Choices grew significantly in 2021 and remained nearly equal to this elevated level in 2022, the percentage of students who reported feeling the same or less anxiety since enrolling at Choices remains very strong. Choices is often a refuge for students experiencing anxiety, and the vast majority of students stabilize or improve in CCS’s safe, caring, and flexible program.

Choices Charter School’s small, personalized learning program, which is flexible in meeting the various needs of individual students, is particularly effective at supporting all students in an equitable fashion. LCFCC funding that allows for supplemental services that target the needs of disadvantaged student populations is helpful in achieving this equity. LCAP support services such as tutoring, college & career planning support, community enhancements, technology resources, and accommodations for mental health challenges will continue to meet a variety of important student needs.

![Reflections: Identified Needs](attachment_b.png)

**Reflections: Identified Needs**  
A description of any areas that need significant improvement based on a review of Dashboard and local data, including any areas of low performance and significant performance gaps among student groups on Dashboard indicators, and any steps taken to address those areas.

- **Chronic Absenteeism** grew significantly for All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students between 2019 and 2021 (no data available in 2020). This was concerning to the CCS staff; however, less consistent completion of homework during distance learning likely contributed to absences that were initially recorded when homework was late but ultimately completed for academic credit. Because the rise in Chronic Absenteeism did not coincide with a drop in CAASPP scores, the concern about this metric was limited. Though Chronic Absenteeism at Choices remains elevated in 2022, this is also true for students throughout the state; 2022 Chronic Absenteeism metrics for All Students, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, and English Learners at Choices began to drop in 2022 and were lower than the corresponding figures for the State of California. This metric remains a concern and will be tracked carefully for expected stabilization in 2023 and beyond.

Choices is very pleased with the growth and equity reflected in its Graduation Rate, CAASPP scores, College Career Indicator, and encouraging mental health data. However, data that lags behind corresponding state averages continues to point to areas of need. In 2022, the Graduation Rates of All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students were lower than corresponding state averages, as were the percentage of All Students, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, and “Ever-EL” English Learners who met or exceeded standard on the CAASPP SBA Math. “Ever-EL” English Learners at Choices scored at or above standard on the CAASPP Science CAST less frequently than “Ever-EL” English Learners across the state. The California State average College Career Indicator is also significantly higher for All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students than it is at Choices. The recent changes in Chronic Absenteeism Rates, which have increased at Choices, have moved in tandem with those of the state but to a slightly less dramatic extent.

Building Choices’ students’ Math proficiency and college and career readiness are primary areas of focus at Choices, based on student data. LCAP funds will continue to target these areas of need where Choices expects to continue to experience incremental growth.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal 1

| Goal # | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1      | Improve and support student learning to close achievement gaps and ensure all students graduate college and career ready. <br> **Focus 1:** Provide professional development and support for quality first instruction leading to increased student learning (research based instructional practices which acknowledge and respect cultural and economic diversity). <br> **Focus 2:** Provide school-based structures and services which supply early intervention for and prevention of learning difficulties. <br> **Focus 3:** Provide academic support structures and services which increase rates of students graduating on time and college and career ready. <br> **Focus 4:** Provide engaging and relevant classes and activities on campuses. |

### State Priorities:
1. Basic (Conditions of Learning)
2. Implementation of State Standards (Conditions of Learning)
3. Parent Involvement (Engagement)
4. Student Achievement (Pupil Outcomes)
5. Student Engagement (Engagement)
6. School Climate (Engagement)
7. Course Access (Conditions of Learning)
8. Student Outcomes (Pupil Outcomes)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
The Choices Charter School LCAP Goals were chosen to align with the San Juan Unified School District’s LCAP Goals and in an effort to close all achievement gaps between student subgroups, ensuring an equitable educational environment for all. Students in disadvantaged student subgroups at Choices have often lagged behind the performance of All Students in the past; however, LCAP services have been and continue to be effective at meeting needs of students in a variety of situations, and data currently points to a highly equitable learning environment at CCS.

## Goal Analysis for 2022-23
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

### Actions/Services Not Implemented as Planned:
Due to evolving resources and perspectives, the following planned LCAP services were offered in a different format or paused in 2022-23:

**Tutoring:**
- Tutor prioritizing Students with Disabilities (providing on-site and online tutoring). +15 Tutor hours per week  
  - Instead of hiring a tutor to work with Students with Disabilities, one part-time Resource Specialist / Teacher expanded to full time, and a second full-time Resource Specialist / Teacher was hired. Each individual spent many hours each week providing individualized instruction and support to Students with Disabilities.

**College & Career Planning Support:**
- Provide students and families with three College & Career presentations per year. Focus on University, Trade School, and Community College applications. Promote events via automated phone message, ParentSquare email, and class announcements by Faculty. +30 Counselor hours per year  
  - One College & Career Family Night was offered in the fall, during the new College & Career Week. The presentation covered university, community college, and trade school paths. This presentation will be expanded to two presentations during the College & Career Week in 2023 and will include extensive information about scholarships. In 2022-23, a College & Career presentation tailored to students with IEPs was offered to Students with Disabilities, and this will be repeated in 2023-24, as well.
  
- Prepare for an on-campus Career Fair in Fall 2022. +5 Community Liaison hours per year  
  - Due to resource restrictions and the belief that there are more efficient ways to provide college/career-oriented experiences to students, the Career Fair has been suspended. In 2022-23, the College & Career Week was expanded to include guest speakers, and the Counselor organized trips to the SJUSD College Fair and the CSUS College Fair.  
  - Host on-campus speakers who will share information about their professions and the entrance requirements in their fields. Posters about guest speakers to be featured around the school. +40 Counselor hours per year

- Speakers did not come to campus throughout the year, but two speakers did present to students during College & Career Week. More speakers will be invited to speak to students throughout the school year in 2023-24.

## Community Enhancements:
- Continue to add at least one extra-curricular activity each year. +2 Staff hours per week
  - In 2022-23, several new activities have taken place. With the return of Intramurals, students meet together weekly to play games and sports. A Podcasting Club meets weekly and produces Choices Chatter. Each organization involves occasional trips off campus.
- Provide at least four field trip experiences: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th grade (possibly 11th grade). +80 Faculty hours per year
  - Many field trips were offered to students in 2022-23, but they were not necessarily specific to grade levels. One field trip for 6th graders (to the CSUS Planetarium) was offered, while other field trips, such as the SJUSD College Fair, the CSUS College Fair, the Sacramento Speaker Series, and Grad Night were made available to all high school students. In 2023-24, more field trips will be made available to both middle and high school students.
- Virtual Reality Science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics) Labs (+2 Faculty hours per week + cost of curriculum)
  - Virtual Reality Science Labs were paused for one year but will be made available to students in 2023-24.

## Miscellaneous Support:
- Provide four in-person, evening training sessions for parents: use of School Pathways, PLP, and best practices for supporting an independent study student. +40 Director hours per year
  - Parent training sessions were paused for one year but will be made available again in 2023-24.
- Vertical Teaming in Departments (Professional Development) once per month. +25 Faculty hours per month
  - Due to an upcoming WASC accreditation visit, most professional development time in 2022-23 has been used to analyze data, re-evaluate the Choices program, and document findings in WASC Focus Groups. A return to working more in departments will occur in 2023-24.
- Continue to provide intervention services for students who struggle academically and/or socially. Advisory Teachers implement a new official intervention process at the close of each log period. (+Full-time Community Liaison, + 18 Counselor hours per week, +9 Assistant Director hours per week, + 40 Faculty hours per week)
  - Intervention services were offered, but a formal process occurring at the close of each log period was not implemented by Advisory Teachers. This will remain in the plan to be implemented in 2023-24.
- Formative Assessment with iReady in English and Math 3X per year +120 Faculty hours per year
  - iReady diagnostic and formative assessments were administered twice in 2022-23 and will be administered twice in 2023-24, as well.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.

In 2022-23, funds assigned to actions/services that were not ultimately implemented as planned were diverted to the new implementations of the actions/services or to other activities that addressed the needs of disadvantaged student subgroups. Fewer expenditures than planned in the areas of college & career presentations, a career fair, on-campus speakers, virtual science labs, parent training, vertical teaming, and iReady administration were somewhat offset by greater expenditures than planned in tutoring, the College & Career Week, extracurricular activities, field trips, and school program analysis. Estimated actual expenditures were lower than planned expenditures but remained well above 2022-23 LCFF requirements.

An explanation of how effective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal.

No data is yet available for the 2022-23 school year. However, given that most of the actions/services that Choices provided in 2022-23 are the same or very similar to those provided in recent previous years, data from 2019-2022 provides some direction in evaluating the effectiveness of CCS’s efforts to provide student services in an equitable manner. Some data types have been unavailable in recent years, and data for English Learners and Foster Youth are often not published due to insufficient sample sizes. However, the data that is available is largely positive:

Graduation Rate: The Graduation Rates of All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students grew in 2020, 2021, and 2022. The Graduation Rates of each group have remained nearly equal or equal (2022) to one another, demonstrating equity of the Choices Charter program. Approximately one-third of 2022 graduates stated that they would not have graduated from high school had they not enrolled at Choices, and more than half of them planned to immediately enroll in colleges or trade schools.

CAASPP (ELA SBA, Math SBA, and Science CAST): In 2021, disadvantaged student subgroups exceeded the proficiency of All Students in almost all categories. Rates of proficiency fell in all subjects, for all student groups, in 2022. Disadvantaged student subgroups lagged behind All Students in ELA and Math. However, “Ever-EL” English Learners lagged by very little in both subjects. In Science, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students outperformed All Students, while “Ever-EL” English Learners performed less well. SBA and CAST performance and achievement gaps between All Students and disadvantaged student subgroups have fluctuated over time. Due to small sample sizes, statistics often change significantly from year to year. Multiple years of data are studied to identify trends. Significant gains in proficiency by all student groups in 2021 seemed to suggest that the modified, shorter SBA exam given in 2021 were less challenging than the standard version that was administered in 2019. However, State of California data shows that students in all subgroups experienced declines in performance, on average, across the state in 2021. In fact, Choices students not only improved in 2021; they significantly outperformed the state proficiency rates in nearly all categories. Choices students may have fared better than most students in the state, due to consistency in curriculum and instruction and dedicated outreach to families throughout 2020 and 2021. Whereas traditional schools often struggled to adjust to distance learning conditions, Choices was able to transition nearly seamlessly. Most rates of proficiency dropped between 2021 and 2022 for both Choices and the State of California. However, in most cases, Choices students in all student groups have outperformed state averages in both years.

**College Career Indicator:** The College Career Indicator (“CCI”) of Choices graduates has grown steadily in recent years. The CCI for both All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students grew in 2020. Thanks to a growing focus on Choices’ college and career readiness opportunities, such as A-G courses, co-enrollment at community colleges, a Career Technical Education Pathway in Business & Finance, and two World Language tracks that lead to biliteracy, more Choices students are considered “Prepared” for college and career each year.

**A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice:**

In addition to the changes made to the LCAP for 2023-24 that were based on input from all educational partners, the following changes to Goal 1 have been made based specifically on reflection of prior practice:

- The Career Fair has been suspended and has been replaced with field trips to the SJUSD College Fair and the CSUS College Fair.
- College & Career presentations for families will take place during College & Career Week instead of being offered throughout the school year.
- The cost of providing breakfast and lunch to students during standardized testing will be eliminated from the LCAP, as all breakfast and lunch for all students throughout the school year is now free.
- A College/Career page will be more prominently featured on the new school website to debut in 2023-24.
- Field trips will be grade-specific in grades 6-8, but high school field trips will be available to all high school students, and most will be focused on college and career exploration.

![Goal 2](attachment_b)

| Goal # | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 2      | Foster a respectful, collaborative, and reflective school culture that ensures academic success and social/emotional well-being of each student. <br> **Focus 1:** Expand health and social/emotional support services and interventions to students and their families. <br> **Focus 2:** Increase the voice of parents and students to ensure feedback loops on key initiatives and issues. <br> **Focus 3:** Improve the collaborative culture throughout the school among staff, students, families, and community. |

**State Priorities:**  
5. Student Engagement (Engagement)  
6. School Climate (Engagement)  

**An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal:**  
The Choices Charter School LCAP Goals were chosen to align with the San Juan Unified School District’s LCAP Goals and in an effort to close all achievement gaps between student subgroups, ensuring an equitable educational environment for all. In 2022, 34% of new students reported that “social/other anxiety” was a primary reason for enrolling at Choices. School surveys show that roughly half of both All Students and Students with Disabilities feel less anxious once enrolled at Choices, suggesting equitable experiences across various students subgroups. An overwhelming majority of students report that they feel safe at Choices. Choices recognizes that students learn best when they feel safe and well and that the program’s ability to meet these needs is a hallmark of its success. CCS seeks to continue to support students’ social/emotional needs in an equitable fashion, ensuring equal access to education for all.

# Goal Analysis for 2022-23
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.

## A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

### Actions/Services Not Implemented:
All planned actions/services were implemented for Goal 2 in 2022-23.

### Actions/Services Added to the LCAP & Implemented:
No new actions/services were added to this goal in 2022-23.

## An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.
There were no material differences between planned and actual services for Goal 2 in 2022-23.

## An explanation of how effective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal.

### Student Anxiety Levels (School Satisfaction Survey):
While the percentage of new students reporting that “social/other anxiety” was a primary reason for enrolling at Choices grew significantly in 2021 (to 37%) and remained nearly equal to this elevated level in 2022 (34%), the percentage of students who reported feeling the same or less anxiety since enrolling at Choices remained strong (88% in 2022). Choices is often a refuge for students experiencing anxiety, and the vast majority of students stabilize or improve in CCS’s safe, caring, and flexible program.

## A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.
Because students have been permitted to attend on-campus classes and activities for two school years, following the COVID-19 campus closure in 2020-21, the Goal 2, Action 2 title has been modified from **Expanded Mental Health Support to Support Students’ Return to In-Person Learning** to **Mental Health Support for Students**. Because the Community Liaison does not provide counseling support and most often is not the individual to refer students to tutoring services or to counseling services through SJUSD or local community colleges, the Community Liaison has been removed from the Goal 2, Action 2 Description.

## A report of the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for last year’s actions may be found in the Annual Update Table. A report of the Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services for last year’s actions may be found in the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table.

## Required Descriptions

For each action being provided to an entire school, or across the entire school district or county office of education (COE), an explanation of (1) how the needs of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students were considered first, and (2) how these actions are effective in meeting the goals for these students.

### 2023-24 Actions/ Services:

**Tutoring:** Tutoring is available for all students but targets, in particular, needs of students who do not receive help at home, who have special learning needs/disabilities, and/or who require additional assistance with English Language Acquisition. 2023-24 tutoring services will include tutoring via Zoom, serving students from a distance when they have transportation difficulties or other responsibilities in the home that prevent them from leaving. An emphasis on skill-building will guide tutoring sessions. Math tutoring will be prioritized in Middle School to address existing deficiencies in skills and to prevent deficiencies from developing. Tutoring hours will be communicated to the entire school community online; students will be able to sign up to meet tutors or teachers for assistance at specific times, for specific subjects, as needed. This includes the availability of tutoring to meet the needs of English Learners who are enrolled in an English Learner Development course. Students with IEPs receive regular homework assistance from Resource Specialists on campus or via Zoom.

**College & Career Planning Support:** Choices’ college and career planning support is available to all students but serves perhaps most importantly the students whose parents are not equipped with the resources or experience to effectively guide their students in the approach to their post-secondary college and career pursuits. These services are also especially important for Students with Disabilities who face additional obstacles in pursuing post-secondary educational opportunities and need specialized information and assistance. All services are offered to students with these needs in mind. College & Career presentations will be offered to students and their families in the evenings during College & Career Week, in an effort to reach all families, including those who work during school hours. Presentations will include information about applying for scholarships so that no student will feel that college is financially inaccessible. College & Career information on the CCS website brings resources into the family home. An on-campus Counselor supports students and families on an individual basis with college research and assistance with applications at no additional charge. Students will be guided toward college and career readiness at each grade level, 6-12, with projects tailored to specific age groups incorporated into English courses. All other classroom-based courses offer students at least one college/career-oriented assignment per year that requires students to consider post-secondary pursuits that align with the given subject matter of the course. On-campus speakers, field trips, and the Sacramento Speaker Series will introduce students to various professions that may be new to them, sparking interests and engaging them in their education. Students will attend the SJUSD College Fair and the CSUS College Fair. College visits will include American River College, CSU Sacramento, and UC Davis. While on college campuses, when possible, students will visit the Disabilities Services and Programs for Students (DSPS) and Financial Aid offices. An annual College & Career Week brings long-term planning into focus with college & career-oriented campus decorations, celebrations, presentations, and prize giveaways. A College & Career Workshop for Students with Disabilities provides informational resources tailored to students who need special services in their post-secondary educational pursuits. Choices offers several academic pathways to college and career readiness. A Career Technical Education (CTE) Pathway in Business & Finance debuted in Fall 2018. A second CTE Pathway in Public Services/ Public Safety or Arts, Media, & Entertainment will debut in coming years. A-G, Advanced Placement, and World Language courses support students in becoming college and career ready. The Choices Charter School Graduation Outcomes center on the process of setting goals, adjusting goals as needed, persevering through challenges, and ultimately, accomplishing objectives.

**Community Enhancements:** Each year, CCS expands its elective and extracurricular offerings, in an effort to more effectively engage students in school. English Learners, in particular, are encouraged to enroll in classroom-based elective courses and participate in extracurricular activities, as a means of improving their English Language skills through peer interaction. An EL Coordinator guides formal intervention for English Learners and teaches an ELD course. In order to further engage students, in 2023-24, CCS will continue to offer field trips that are designed to expose students, particularly those who are disadvantaged, to new experiences. New Virtual Reality labs will also provide a new dimension for exploring information and ideas. All electives, extracurricular events, and field trips are offered, free of charge, and are designed to reach students where they are through direct experience. Choices seeks to engage students in their education in a safe learning environment where they are supported with basic needs and guidance. On campus, students in need are supported through a clothes closet and free hygiene supplies, and all students may enjoy breakfast and lunch at school at no cost. Because positive reinforcement is a powerful motivator, Choices seeks to expand its set of rewards systems that regularly and frequently acknowledge academic progress, growth, and character in 2023-24.

**Technology Resources:** Annual technology upgrades support student learning in the classroom and in the computer lab and allow for the administration of computerized exams. In 2023-24, CCS will continue to refer families in need to a provider that offers discounted internet service rates to qualifying families. Laptops will also be available for loan; the supply of computers available for this purpose will grow each year.

as new models are purchased for testing and classroom use. Wi-Fi hotspots will be provided where necessary. Technical support will be available to both students and staff, both on campus and at home. Every effort will be made to ensure that technology and support is available to students, regardless of financial need or language barrier.

**Miscellaneous Support:** At CCS, students in targeted subgroup populations are supported through thoughtful course enrollment, academic counseling, and formal interventions when students are struggling. Student data is collected and analyzed on a regular basis; changes in curriculum, instruction, or program format are made to address areas of need. The CCS Staff is trained on administration of standardized exams to ensure that students are afforded a comfortable testing environment that can be tailored, in some cases, to students’ individual needs. SJUSD Food Services provides students with free breakfast and lunch throughout the school year. Student intervention services assist students who struggle academically and/or socially. In 2023-24, additional resources will be devoted to supporting parents as they support their students, through more extensive training during the registration process and in the evenings throughout the year. Advisory Teachers check in with new families shortly after students begin school, introducing themselves as a main contact for the family. A New Families Liaison also connects with families throughout their first month of enrollment to facilitate a smooth transition to the independent study model. Faculty members will meet in departments each month to optimize consistency within subject areas and to ensure that standards are adequately addressed at each grade level. Diagnostic and Formative Assessment with iReady will allow teachers of English and Math to determine individual students’ strengths and areas of need and to gauge academic growth throughout the year, reteaching concepts when deemed necessary.

**Identify, Support, and Track Progress of Students with Anxiety:** Because many of CCS’s students with anxiety have Individualized Education Plans, CCS developed and piloted a system of identifying, supporting, and tracking the progress of students with anxiety in the Students with Disabilities subgroup first. In 2017-18, this process was expanded into the general student population in an effort to more effectively reach all students who are struggling. In August 2018, the CCS Staff was formally trained by an anxiety specialist. The CCS program is well-suited to welcome students with anxiety, thanks to the flexible nature of the independent study model and the knowledgeable and compassionate staff. The CCS staff seeks to continue to increase the percentage of students who report that their anxiety levels are lower since enrolling at Choices through compassion and flexibility.

**Mental Health Support for Students:** The CCS Staff is committed to conducting vigilant outreach to students who are struggling academically or emotionally. The Counselor assists students with referrals to free tutoring, free counseling, or referrals to SJUSD or other community counseling services, as needed.

A description of how services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students are being increased or improved by the percentage required.

**Percentage of Students in Targeted Subgroups (2022):**  
Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students: 46%  
English Learners: 6%  
Foster Youth: 1%  

At Choices, students in disadvantaged student subgroups comprise roughly half of total school enrollment. All LCAP services are designed to support All Students but are targeted in particular to serve those who may have fewer opportunities due to disabilities, financial challenges, language barriers, and/or familial instability. CCS seeks to make academic content, instruction, school community, mental health support, and college & career services accessible to all students in an equitable fashion.

A description of the plan for how the additional concentration grant add-on funding identified above will be used to increase the number of staff providing direct services to students at schools that have a high concentration (above 55 percent) of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students, as applicable.

**NA:** Choices Charter School does not qualify for additional concentration grant add-on funding.

**Introduction and Instructions**  
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) requires local educational agencies (LEAs) to engage their local educational partners in an annual planning process to evaluate their progress within eight state priority areas encompassing all statutory metrics (COEs have 10 state priorities). LEAs document the results of this planning process in the LCAP using the template adopted by the State Board of Education.

The LCAP development process serves three distinct, but related functions:

- **Comprehensive Strategic Planning**: The process of developing and annually updating the LCAP supports comprehensive strategic planning (California Education Code [EC] Section 52064[e][1]). Strategic planning that is comprehensive connects budgetary decisions to teaching and learning performance data. LEAs should continually evaluate the hard choices they make about the use of limited resources to meet student and community needs to ensure opportunities and outcomes are improved for all students.

- **Meaningful Engagement of Educational Partners**: The LCAP development process should result in an LCAP that reflects decisions made through meaningful engagement (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Local educational partners possess valuable perspectives and insights about an LEA's programs and services. Effective strategic planning will incorporate these perspectives and insights in order to identify potential goals and actions to be included in the LCAP.

- **Accountability and Compliance**: The LCAP serves an important accountability function because aspects of the LCAP template require LEAs to show that they have complied with various requirements specified in the LCFF statutes and regulations, most notably:
  - Demonstrating that LEAs are increasing or improving services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students in proportion to the amount of additional funding those students generate under LCFF (EC Section 52064[b][4-6]).

---

Page 44 of 66

<!-- Page 304 -->
- Establishing goals, supported by actions and related expenditures, that address the statutory priority areas and statutory metrics (EC sections 52064[b][1] and [2]).

- Annually reviewing and updating the LCAP to reflect progress toward the goals (EC Section 52064[b][7]).

The LCAP template, like each LEA’s final adopted LCAP, is a document, not a process. LEAs must use the template to memorialize the outcome of their LCAP development process, which should: (a) reflect comprehensive strategic planning (b) through meaningful engagement with educational partners that (c) meets legal requirements, as reflected in the final adopted LCAP. The sections included within the LCAP template do not and cannot reflect the full development process, just as the LCAP template itself is not intended as a tool for engaging educational partners.

If a county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction over a single school district, the county board of education and the governing board of the school district may adopt and file for review and approval a single LCAP consistent with the requirements in EC sections 52060, 52062, 52066, 52068, and 52070. The LCAP must clearly articulate to which entity’s budget (school district or county superintendent of schools) all budgeted and actual expenditures are aligned.

The revised LCAP template for the 2021–22, 2022–23, and 2023–24 school years reflects statutory changes made through Assembly Bill 1840 (Committee on Budget), Chapter 243, Statutes of 2018. These statutory changes enhance transparency regarding expenditures on actions included in the LCAP, including actions that contribute to meeting the requirement to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students, and to streamline the information presented within the LCAP to make adopted LCAPs more accessible for educational partners and the public.

At its most basic, the adopted LCAP should attempt to distill not just what the LEA is doing for students in transitional kindergarten through grade twelve (TK–12), but also allow educational partners to understand what and why, and whether those strategies are leading to improved opportunities and outcomes for students. LEAs are strongly encouraged to use language and a level of detail in their adopted LCAPs intended to be meaningful and accessible for the LEA’s diverse educational partners and the broader public.

In developing and finalizing the LCAP for adoption, LEAs are encouraged to keep the following overarching frame at the forefront of the strategic planning and educational partner engagement functions:

Given present performance across the state priorities and on indicators in the California School Dashboard (Dashboard), how is the LEA using its budgetary resources to respond to TK–12 student and community needs, and address any performance gaps, including by meeting its obligation to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students?

LEAs are encouraged to focus on a set of metrics and actions that the LEA believes, based on input gathered from educational partners, research, and experience, will have the biggest impact on behalf of its TK–12 students.

These instructions address the requirements for each section of the LCAP, but may include information about effective practices when developing the LCAP and completing the LCAP itself. Additionally, information is included at the beginning of each section emphasizing the purpose that each section serves.

# Plan Summary

## Purpose
A well-developed Plan Summary section provides a meaningful context for the LCAP. This section provides information about an LEA’s community as well as relevant information about student needs and performance. In order to provide a meaningful context for the rest of the LCAP, the content of this section should be clearly and meaningfully related to the content included in the subsequent sections of the LCAP.

## Requirements and Instructions

### General Information
– Briefly describe the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades TK–12, as applicable to the LEA. For example, information about an LEA in terms of geography, enrollment, or employment, the number and size of specific schools, recent community challenges, and other such information as an LEA wishes to include can enable a reader to more fully understand an LEA’s LCAP.

### Reflections: Successes
– Based on a review of performance on the state indicators and local performance indicators included in the Dashboard, progress toward LCAP goals, local self-assessment tools, input from educational partners, and any other information, what progress is the LEA most proud of and how does the LEA plan to maintain or build upon that success? This may include identifying specific examples of how past increases or improvements in services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students have led to improved performance for these students.

### Reflections: Identified Need
– Referring to the Dashboard, identify: (a) any state indicator for which overall performance was in the “Red” or “Orange” performance category or any local indicator where the LEA received a “Not Met” or “Not Met for Two or More Years” rating AND (b) any state indicator for which performance for any student group was two or more performance levels below the “all student” performance. What steps is the LEA planning to take to address these areas of low performance and performance gaps? An LEA that is required to include a goal to address one or more consistently low-performing student groups or low-performing schools must identify that it is required to include this goal and must also identify the applicable student group(s) and/or school(s). Other needs may be identified using locally collected data including data collected to inform the self-reflection tools and reporting local indicators on the Dashboard.

### LCAP Highlights
– Identify and briefly summarize the key features of this year’s LCAP.

### Comprehensive Support and Improvement
– An LEA with a school or schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement (CSI) under the Every Student Succeeds Act must respond to the following prompts:

---

Page 46 of 66  
305
<!-- Page 306 -->
- **Schools Identified:** Identify the schools within the LEA that have been identified for CSI.

- **Support for Identified Schools:** Describe how the LEA has or will support the identified schools in developing CSI plans that included a school-level needs assessment, evidence-based interventions, and the identification of any resource inequities to be addressed through the implementation of the CSI plan.

- **Monitoring and Evaluating Effectiveness:** Describe how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the CSI plan to support student and school improvement.

### Engaging Educational Partners

**Purpose**

Significant and purposeful engagement of parents, students, educators, and other educational partners, including those representing the student groups identified by LCFF, is critical to the development of the LCAP and the budget process. Consistent with statute, such engagement should support comprehensive strategic planning, accountability, and improvement across the state priorities and locally identified priorities (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Engagement of educational partners is an ongoing, annual process.

This section is designed to reflect how the engagement of educational partners influenced the decisions reflected in the adopted LCAP. The goal is to allow educational partners that participated in the LCAP development process and the broader public understand how the LEA engaged educational partners and the impact of that engagement. LEAs are encouraged to keep this goal in the forefront when completing this section.

Statute and regulations specify the educational partners that school districts and COEs must consult when developing the LCAP: teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, local bargaining units of the LEA, parents, and students. Before adopting the LCAP, school districts and COEs must share it with the Parent Advisory Committee and, if applicable, to its English Learner Parent Advisory Committee. The superintendent is required by statute to respond in writing to the comments received from these committees. School districts and COEs must also consult with the special education local plan area administrator(s) when developing the LCAP.

Statute requires charter schools to consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, parents, and students in developing the LCAP. The LCAP should also be shared with, and LEAs should request input from, schoolsite-level advisory groups, as applicable (e.g., schoolsite councils, English Learner Advisory Councils, student advisory groups, etc.), to facilitate alignment between schoolsite and district-level goals and actions.

Information and resources that support effective engagement, define student consultation, and provide the requirements for advisory group composition, can be found under Resources on the following web page of the CDE’s website: [CDE Resources](https://www.cde.ca.gov/re/lc/).

- Inclusion of action(s) or a group of actions
- Elimination of action(s) or group of actions
- Changes to the level of proposed expenditures for one or more actions
- Inclusion of action(s) as contributing to increased or improved services for unduplicated students

**Goals and Actions**

**Purpose**  
Well-developed goals will clearly communicate to educational partners what the LEA plans to accomplish, what the LEA plans to do in order to accomplish the goal, and how the LEA will know when it has accomplished the goal. A goal statement, associated metrics and expected outcomes, and the actions included in the goal should be in alignment. The explanation for why the LEA included a goal is an opportunity for LEAs to clearly communicate to educational partners and the public why, among the various strengths and areas for improvement highlighted by performance data and strategies and actions that could be pursued, the LEA decided to pursue this goal, and the related metrics, expected outcomes, actions, and expenditures.

A well-developed goal can be focused on the performance relative to a metric or metrics for all students, a specific student group(s), narrowing performance gaps, or implementing programs or strategies expected to impact outcomes. LEAs should assess the performance of their student groups when developing goals and the related actions to achieve such goals.

# Requirements and Instructions

LEAs should prioritize the goals, specific actions, and related expenditures included within the LCAP within one or more state priorities. LEAs should consider performance on the state and local indicators, including their locally collected and reported data for the local indicators that are included in the Dashboard in determining whether and how to prioritize its goals within the LCAP.

In order to support prioritization of goals, the LCAP template provides LEAs with the option of developing three different kinds of goals:

- **Focus Goal:** A Focus Goal is relatively more concentrated in scope and may focus on a fewer number of metrics to measure improvement. A Focus Goal statement will be time bound and make clear how the goal is to be measured.

- **Broad Goal:** A Broad Goal is relatively less concentrated in its scope and may focus on improving performance across a wide range of metrics.

- **Maintenance of Progress Goal:** A Maintenance of Progress Goal includes actions that may be ongoing without significant changes and allows an LEA to track performance on any metrics not addressed in the other goals of the LCAP.

At a minimum, the LCAP must address all LCFF priorities and associated metrics.

## Focus Goal(s)

**Goal Description:** The description provided for a Focus Goal must be specific, measurable, and time bound. An LEA develops a Focus Goal to address areas of need that may require or benefit from a more specific and data intensive approach. The Focus Goal can explicitly reference the metric(s) by which achievement of the goal will be measured and the time frame according to which the LEA expects to achieve the goal.

**Explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal:** Explain why the LEA has chosen to prioritize this goal. An explanation must be based on Dashboard data or other locally collected data. LEAs must describe how the LEA identified this goal for focused attention, including relevant consultation with educational partners. LEAs are encouraged to promote transparency and understanding around the decision to pursue a focus goal.

## Broad Goal

**Goal Description:** Describe what the LEA plans to achieve through the actions included in the goal. The description of a broad goal will be clearly aligned with the expected measurable outcomes included for the goal. The goal description organizes the actions and expected outcomes in a cohesive and consistent manner. A goal description is specific enough to be measurable in either quantitative or qualitative terms. A broad goal is not as specific as a focus goal. While it is specific enough to be measurable, there are many different metrics for measuring progress toward the goal.

**Explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal:** Explain why the LEA developed this goal and how the actions and metrics grouped together will help achieve the goal.

**Maintenance of Progress Goal**  
**Goal Description:** Describe how the LEA intends to maintain the progress made in the LCFF State Priorities not addressed by the other goals in the LCAP. Use this type of goal to address the state priorities and applicable metrics not addressed within the other goals in the LCAP. The state priorities and metrics to be addressed in this section are those for which the LEA, in consultation with educational partners, has determined to maintain actions and monitor progress while focusing implementation efforts on the actions covered by other goals in the LCAP.

**Explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal:** Explain how the actions will sustain the progress exemplified by the related metrics.

**Required Goals**  
In general, LEAs have flexibility in determining what goals to include in the LCAP and what those goals will address; however, beginning with the development of the 2022–23 LCAP, LEAs that meet certain criteria are required to include a specific goal in their LCAP.

**Consistently low-performing student group(s) criteria:** An LEA is eligible for Differentiated Assistance for three or more consecutive years based on the performance of the same student group or groups in the Dashboard. A list of the LEAs required to include a goal in the LCAP based on student group performance, and the student group(s) that lead to identification, may be found on the CDE’s Local Control Funding Formula web page at [CDE Local Control Funding](https://www.cde.ca.gov/fq/aa/lc/).

- **Consistently low-performing student group(s) goal requirement:** An LEA meeting the consistently low-performing student group(s) criteria must include a goal in its LCAP focused on improving the performance of the student group or groups that led to the LEA’s eligibility for Differentiated Assistance. This goal must include metrics, outcomes, actions, and expenditures specific to addressing the needs of, and improving outcomes for, this student group or groups. An LEA required to address multiple student groups is not required to have a goal to address each student group; however, each student group must be specifically addressed in the goal. This requirement may not be met by combining this required goal with another goal.

- **Goal Description:** Describe the outcomes the LEA plans to achieve to address the needs of, and improve outcomes for, the student group or groups that led to the LEA’s eligibility for Differentiated Assistance.

- **Explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal:** Explain in why the LEA is required to develop this goal, including identifying the student group(s) that lead to the LEA being required to develop this goal, how the actions and associated metrics included in this goal differ from previous efforts to improve outcomes for the student group(s), and why the LEA believes the actions, metrics, and expenditures included in this goal will help achieve the outcomes identified in the goal description.

Low-performing school(s) criteria: The following criteria only applies to a school district or COE with two or more schools; it does not apply to a single-school district. A school district or COE has one or more schools that, for two consecutive years, received the two lowest performance levels on all but one of the state indicators for which the school(s) receive performance levels in the Dashboard and the performance of the “All Students” student group for the LEA is at least one performance level higher in all of those indicators. A list of the LEAs required to include a goal in the LCAP based on school performance, and the school(s) that lead to identification, may be found on the CDE’s Local Control Funding Formula web page at https://www.cde.ca.gov/fq/aa/lc/.

- **Low-performing school(s) goal requirement:** A school district or COE meeting the low-performing school(s) criteria must include a goal in its LCAP focusing on addressing the disparities in performance between the school(s) and the LEA as a whole. This goal must include metrics, outcomes, actions, and expenditures specific to addressing the needs of, and improving outcomes for, the students enrolled at the low-performing school or schools. An LEA required to address multiple schools is not required to have a goal to address each school; however, each school must be specifically addressed in the goal. This requirement may not be met by combining this goal with another goal.

- **Goal Description:** Describe what outcomes the LEA plans to achieve to address the disparities in performance between the students enrolled at the low-performing school(s) and the students enrolled at the LEA as a whole.

- **Explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal:** Explain why the LEA is required to develop this goal, including identifying the schools(s) that lead to the LEA being required to develop this goal; how the actions and associated metrics included in this goal differ from previous efforts to improve outcomes for the school(s); and why the LEA believes the actions, metrics, and expenditures included in this goal will help achieve the outcomes for students enrolled at the low-performing school or schools identified in the goal description.

**Measuring and Reporting Results:**
For each LCAP year, identify the metric(s) that the LEA will use to track progress toward the expected outcomes. LEAs are encouraged to identify metrics for specific student groups, as appropriate, including expected outcomes that would reflect narrowing of any existing performance gaps.

Include in the baseline column the most recent data associated with this metric available at the time of adoption of the LCAP for the first year of the three-year plan. LEAs may use data as reported on the 2019 Dashboard for the baseline of a metric only if that data represents the most recent available (e.g., high school graduation rate).

Using the most recent data available may involve reviewing data the LEA is preparing for submission to the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS) or data that the LEA has recently submitted to CALPADS. Because final 2020–21 outcomes on some metrics may not be computable at the time the 2021–24 LCAP is adopted (e.g., graduation rate, suspension rate), the most recent data available may include a point in time calculation taken each year on the same date for comparability purposes.

The baseline data shall remain unchanged throughout the three-year LCAP.

Complete the table as follows:

- **Metric:** Indicate how progress is being measured using a metric.
- **Baseline:** Enter the baseline when completing the LCAP for 2021–22. As described above, the baseline is the most recent data associated with a metric. Indicate the school year to which the data applies, consistent with the instructions above.
- **Year 1 Outcome:** When completing the LCAP for 2022–23, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies, consistent with the instructions above.
- **Year 2 Outcome:** When completing the LCAP for 2023–24, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies, consistent with the instructions above.
- **Year 3 Outcome:** When completing the LCAP for 2024–25, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies, consistent with the instructions above. The 2024–25 LCAP will be the first year in the next three-year cycle. Completing this column will be part of the Annual Update for that year.
- **Desired Outcome for 2023–24:** When completing the first year of the LCAP, enter the desired outcome for the relevant metric the LEA expects to achieve by the end of the 2023–24 LCAP year.

The metrics may be quantitative or qualitative; but at minimum, an LEA's LCAP must include goals that are measured using all of the applicable metrics for the related state priorities, in each LCAP year as applicable to the type of LEA. To the extent a state priority does not specify one or more metrics (e.g., implementation of state academic content and performance standards), the LEA must identify a metric to use within the LCAP. For these state priorities, LEAs are encouraged to use metrics based on or reported through the relevant self-reflection tool for local indicators within the Dashboard.

**Actions:** Enter the action number. Provide a short title for the action. This title will also appear in the action tables. Provide a description of the action. Enter the total amount of expenditures associated with this action. Budgeted expenditures from specific fund sources will be provided in the summary tables. Indicate whether the action contributes to meeting the increase or improved services requirement as described in the Increased or Improved Services section using a “Y” for Yes or an “N” for No. (Note: for each such action offered on an LEA-wide or schoolwide basis, the LEA will need to provide additional information in the Increased or Improved Summary Section to address the requirements in California Code of Regulations, Title 5 [5 CCR] Section 15496(b) in the Increased or Improved Services Section of the LCAP).

**Actions for English Learners:** School districts, COEs, and charter schools that have a numerically significant English learner student subgroup must include specific actions in the LCAP related to, at a minimum, the language acquisition programs, as defined in EC Section 306, provided to students and professional development activities specific to English learners.

**Actions for Foster Youth:** School districts, COEs, and charter schools that have a numerically significant Foster Youth student subgroup are encouraged to include specific actions in the LCAP designed to meet needs specific to Foster Youth students.

**Goal Analysis:**

Enter the LCAP Year.

Using actual annual measurable outcome data, including data from the Dashboard, analyze whether the planned actions were effective in achieving the goal. Respond to the prompts as instructed.

- Describe the overall implementation of the actions to achieve the articulated goal. Include a discussion of relevant challenges and successes experienced with the implementation process. This must include any instance where the LEA did not implement a planned action or implemented a planned action in a manner that differs substantively from how it was described in the adopted LCAP.

- Explain material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and between the Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services, as applicable. Minor variances in expenditures or percentages do not need to be addressed, and a dollar-for-dollar accounting is not required.

- Describe the effectiveness of the specific actions to achieve the articulated goal as measured by the LEA. In some cases, not all actions in a goal will be intended to improve performance on all of the metrics associated with the goal. When responding to this prompt, LEAs

Page 54 of 66  
313
<!-- Page 314 -->
![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+B)

may assess the effectiveness of a single action or group of actions within the goal in the context of performance on a single metric or group of specific metrics within the goal that are applicable to the action(s). Grouping actions with metrics will allow for more robust analysis of whether the strategy the LEA is using to impact a specified set of metrics is working and increase transparency for educational partners. LEAs are encouraged to use such an approach when goals include multiple actions and metrics that are not closely associated.

- Describe any changes made to this goal, expected outcomes, metrics, or actions to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis and analysis of the data provided in the Dashboard or other local data, as applicable.

## Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students

### Purpose
A well-written Increased or Improved Services section provides educational partners with a comprehensive description, within a single dedicated section, of how an LEA plans to increase or improve services for its unduplicated students in grades TK–12 as compared to all students in grades TK–12, as applicable, and how LEA-wide or schoolwide actions identified for this purpose meet regulatory requirements. Descriptions provided should include sufficient detail yet be sufficiently succinct to promote a broader understanding of educational partners to facilitate their ability to provide input. An LEA’s description in this section must align with the actions included in the Goals and Actions section as contributing.

### Requirements and Instructions

**Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants:** Specify the amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grant funds the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year based on the number and concentration of low income, foster youth, and English learner students.

**Projected Additional LCFF Concentration Grant (15 percent):** Specify the amount of additional LCFF concentration grant add-on funding, as described in EC Section 42238.02, that the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year.

**Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year:** Specify the estimated percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

**LCFF Carryover — Percentage:** Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

Page 55 of 66  
314
<!-- Page 315 -->
![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+B)

**LCFF Carryover — Dollar:** Specify the LCFF Carryover — Dollar amount identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover amount is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify an amount of zero ($0).

**Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year:** Add the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the Proportional LCFF Required Carryover Percentage. This is the LEAs percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year, as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

**Required Descriptions:**

For each action being provided to an entire school, or across the entire school district or COE, an explanation of (1) how the needs of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students were considered first, and (2) how these actions are effective in meeting the goals for these students.

For each action included in the Goals and Actions section as contributing to the increased or improved services requirement for unduplicated pupils and provided on an LEA-wide or schoolwide basis, the LEA must include an explanation consistent with 5 CCR Section 15496(b). For any such actions continued into the 2021–24 LCAP from the 2017–2020 LCAP, the LEA must determine whether or not the action was effective as expected, and this determination must reflect evidence of outcome data or actual implementation to date.

**Principally Directed and Effective:** An LEA demonstrates how an action is principally directed towards and effective in meeting the LEA’s goals for unduplicated students when the LEA explains how:

- It considers the needs, conditions, or circumstances of its unduplicated pupils;
- The action, or aspect(s) of the action (including, for example, its design, content, methods, or location), is based on these considerations; and
- The action is intended to help achieve an expected measurable outcome of the associated goal.

As such, the response provided in this section may rely on a needs assessment of unduplicated students.

Conclusive statements that a service will help achieve an expected outcome for the goal, without an explicit connection or further explanation as to how, are not sufficient. Further, simply stating that an LEA has a high enrollment percentage of a specific student group or groups does not meet the increase or improve services standard because enrolling students is not the same as serving students.

For example, if an LEA determines that low-income students have a significantly lower attendance rate than the attendance rate for all students, it might justify LEA-wide or schoolwide actions to address this area of need in the following way:

---

Page 56 of 66  
315
<!-- Page 316 -->
![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+B)

After assessing the needs, conditions, and circumstances of our low-income students, we learned that the attendance rate of our low-income students is 7 percent lower than the attendance rate for all students. (Needs, Conditions, Circumstances [Principally Directed])

In order to address this condition of our low-income students, we will develop and implement a new attendance program that is designed to address some of the major causes of absenteeism, including lack of reliable transportation and food, as well as a school climate that does not emphasize the importance of attendance. Goal N, Actions X, Y, and Z provide additional transportation and nutritional resources as well as a districtwide educational campaign on the benefits of high attendance rates. (Contributing Action[s])

These actions are being provided on an LEA-wide basis and we expect/hope that all students with less than a 100 percent attendance rate will benefit. However, because of the significantly lower attendance rate of low-income students, and because the actions meet needs most associated with the chronic stresses and experiences of a socio-economically disadvantaged status, we expect that the attendance rate for our low-income students will increase significantly more than the average attendance rate of all other students. (Measurable Outcomes [Effective In])

COEs and Charter Schools: Describe how actions included as contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement on an LEA-wide basis are principally directed to and effective in meeting its goals for unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priorities as described above. In the case of COEs and charter schools, schoolwide and LEA-wide are considered to be synonymous.

For School Districts Only:

Actions Provided on an LEA-Wide Basis:

Unduplicated Percentage > 55 percent: For school districts with an unduplicated pupil percentage of 55 percent or more, describe how these actions are principally directed to and effective in meeting its goals for unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priorities as described above.

Unduplicated Percentage < 55 percent: For school districts with an unduplicated pupil percentage of less than 55 percent, describe how these actions are principally directed to and effective in meeting its goals for unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priorities. Also describe how the actions are the most effective use of the funds to meet these goals for its unduplicated pupils. Provide the basis for this determination, including any alternatives considered, supporting research, experience, or educational theory.

Actions Provided on a Schoolwide Basis:

School Districts must identify in the description those actions being funded and provided on a schoolwide basis, and include the required description supporting the use of the funds on a schoolwide basis.

Page 57 of 66  
316
<!-- Page 317 -->
For schools with 40 percent or more enrollment of unduplicated pupils: Describe how these actions are principally directed to and effective in meeting its goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priorities.

For school districts expending funds on a schoolwide basis at a school with less than 40 percent enrollment of unduplicated pupils: Describe how these actions are principally directed to and how the actions are the most effective use of the funds to meet its goals for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students in the state and any local priorities.

A description of how services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students are being increased or improved by the percentage required.

Consistent with the requirements of 5 CCR Section 15496, describe how services provided for unduplicated pupils are increased or improved by at least the percentage calculated as compared to the services provided for all students in the LCAP year. To improve services means to grow services in quality and to increase services means to grow services in quantity. Services are increased or improved by those actions in the LCAP that are included in the Goals and Actions section as contributing to the increased or improved services requirement, whether they are provided on an LEA-wide or schoolwide basis or provided on a limited basis to unduplicated students. A limited action is an action that only serves foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income students. This description must address how these action(s) are expected to result in the required proportional increase or improvement in services for unduplicated pupils as compared to the services the LEA provides to all students for the relevant LCAP year.

For any action contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement that is associated with a Planned Percentage of Improved Services in the Contributing Summary Table rather than an expenditure of LCFF funds, describe the methodology that was used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. See the instructions for determining the Planned Percentage of Improved Services for information on calculating the Percentage of Improved Services.

A description of the plan for how the additional concentration grant add-on funding identified above will be used to increase the number of staff providing direct services to students at schools that have a high concentration (above 55 percent) of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students, as applicable.

An LEA that receives the additional concentration grant add-on described in EC Section 42238.02 is required to demonstrate how it is using these funds to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent as compared to the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is equal to or less than 55 percent. The staff who provide direct services to students must be certificated staff and/or classified staff employed by the LEA; classified staff includes custodial staff.

Provide the following descriptions, as applicable to the LEA:

Page 58 of 66  
317
<!-- Page 318 -->
![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+B)

An LEA that does not receive a concentration grant or the concentration grant add-on must indicate that a response to this prompt is not applicable.

Identify the goal and action numbers of the actions in the LCAP that the LEA is implementing to meet the requirement to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

An LEA that does not have comparison schools from which to describe how it is using the concentration grant add-on funds, such as an LEA that only has schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, must describe how it is using the funds to increase the number of credentialed staff, classified staff, or both, including custodial staff, who provide direct services to students at selected schools and the criteria used to determine which schools require additional staffing support.

In the event that an additional concentration grant add-on is not sufficient to increase staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, the LEA must describe how it is using the funds to retain staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

Complete the table as follows:

- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA. The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA. The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of full time equivalent (FTE) staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.

- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA. The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA. The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of FTE staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.

### Action Tables

Complete the Data Entry Table for each action in the LCAP. The information entered into this table will automatically populate the other Action Tables. Information is only entered into the Data Entry Table, the Annual Update Table, the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, and the LCFF Carryover Table. With the exception of the Data Entry Table, the word “input” has been added to column headers to aid in identifying the column(s) where information will be entered. Information is not entered on the remaining Action tables.

The following tables are required to be included as part of the LCAP adopted by the local governing board or governing body:

Data Entry Table  
The Data Entry Table may be included in the LCAP as adopted by the local governing board or governing body, but is not required to be included. In the Data Entry Table, input the following information for each action in the LCAP for that applicable LCAP year:

- LCAP Year: Identify the applicable LCAP Year.

- 1. Projected LCFF Base Grant: Provide the total amount of LCFF funding the LEA estimates it will receive for the coming school year, excluding the supplemental and concentration grants and the add-ons for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Grant Program and the Home to School Transportation Program, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8).

  See EC sections 2574 (for COEs) and 42238.02 (for school districts and charter schools), as applicable, for LCFF apportionment calculations.

- 2. Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants: Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants the LEA estimates it will receive on the basis of the number and concentration of unduplicated students for the coming school year.

- 3. Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year: This percentage will not be entered; it is calculated based on the Projected LCFF Base Grant and the Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the coming LCAP year.

![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+B)

- **LCFF Carryover — Percentage:** Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table from the prior LCAP year. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

- **Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year:** This percentage will not be entered; it is calculated based on the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the LCFF Carryover — Percentage. This is the percentage by which the LEA must increase or improve services for unduplicated pupils as compared to the services provided to all students in the coming LCAP year.

- **Goal #:** Enter the LCAP Goal number for the action.

- **Action #:** Enter the action’s number as indicated in the LCAP Goal.

- **Action Title:** Provide a title of the action.

- **Student Group(s):** Indicate the student group or groups who will be the primary beneficiary of the action by entering “All,” or by entering a specific student group or groups.

- **Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?:** Type “Yes” if the action is included as contributing to meeting the increased or improved services; OR, type “No” if the action is not included as contributing to meeting the increased or improved services.

- **If “Yes” is entered into the Contributing column, then complete the following columns:**
  - **Scope:** The scope of an action may be LEA-wide (i.e., districtwide, countywide, or charterwide), schoolwide, or limited. An action that is LEA-wide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of the LEA. An action that is schoolwide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of a single school. An action that is limited in its scope is an action that serves only one or more unduplicated student groups.
  
  - **Unduplicated Student Group(s):** Regardless of scope, contributing actions serve one or more unduplicated student groups. Indicate one or more unduplicated student groups for whom services are being increased or improved as compared to what all students receive.
  
  - **Location:** Identify the location where the action will be provided. If the action is provided to all schools within the LEA, the LEA must indicate “All Schools.” If the action is provided to specific schools within the LEA or specific grade spans only, the LEA must enter “Specific Schools” or “Specific Grade Spans.” Identify the individual school or a subset of schools or grade spans (e.g., all high schools or grades transitional kindergarten through grade five), as appropriate.

- **Time Span:** Enter “ongoing” if the action will be implemented for an indeterminate period of time. Otherwise, indicate the span of time for which the action will be implemented. For example, an LEA might enter “1 Year,” or “2 Years,” or “6 Months.”

- **Total Personnel:** Enter the total amount of personnel expenditures utilized to implement this action.

- **Total Non-Personnel:** This amount will be automatically calculated based on information provided in the Total Personnel column and the Total Funds column.

- **LCFF Funds:** Enter the total amount of LCFF funds utilized to implement this action, if any. LCFF funds include all funds that make up an LEA’s total LCFF target (i.e., base grant, grade span adjustment, supplemental grant, concentration grant, Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant, and Home-To-School Transportation).
  - **Note:** For an action to contribute towards meeting the increased or improved services requirement it must include some measure of LCFF funding. The action may also include funding from other sources; however, the extent to which an action contributes to meeting the increased or improved services requirement is based on the LCFF funding being used to implement the action.

- **Other State Funds:** Enter the total amount of Other State Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

- **Local Funds:** Enter the total amount of Local Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

- **Federal Funds:** Enter the total amount of Federal Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

- **Total Funds:** This amount is automatically calculated based on amounts entered in the previous four columns.

- **Planned Percentage of Improved Services:** For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the planned quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%). A limited action is an action that only serves foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income students.
  - **Note:** As noted in the instructions for the Increased or Improved Services section, when identifying a Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA must describe the methodology that it used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. The percentage of improved services for an action corresponds to the amount of LCFF funding that the LEA estimates it would expend to implement the action if it were funded.

  For example, an LEA determines that there is a need to analyze data to ensure that instructional aides and expanded learning providers know what targeted supports to provide to students who are foster youth. The LEA could implement this action by hiring additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students, which the LEA estimates would cost $165,000.

<!-- Page 322 -->
![Attachment B](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+B)

Instead, the LEA chooses to utilize a portion of existing staff time to analyze data relating to students who are foster youth. This analysis will then be shared with site principals who will use the data to coordinate services provided by instructional assistants and expanded learning providers to target support to students. In this example, the LEA would divide the estimated cost of $165,000 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Planned Percentage of Improved Service for the action.

## Contributing Actions Table
As noted above, information will not be entered in the Contributing Actions Table; however, the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column will need to be checked to ensure that only actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses.

## Annual Update Table
In the Annual Update Table, provide the following information for each action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditures to implement this action, if any.

## Contributing Actions Annual Update Table
In the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, check the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses. Provide the following information for each contributing action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

- **6. Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants:** Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants the LEA estimates it will actually receive based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the current school year.

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditure of LCFF funds used to implement this action, if any.

- **Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services:** For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis only to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the total estimated actual quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%).

Page 63 of 66  
322
<!-- Page 323 -->
- Building on the example provided above for calculating the Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA in the example implements the action. As part of the annual update process, the LEA reviews implementation and student outcome data and determines that the action was implemented with fidelity and that outcomes for foster youth students improved. The LEA reviews the original estimated cost for the action and determines that it had hired additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students that estimated actual cost would have been $169,500 due to a cost of living adjustment. The LEA would divide the estimated actual cost of $169,500 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

### LCFF Carryover Table
- **9. Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant:** Provide the total amount of LCFF funding the LEA estimates it will receive for the current school year, excluding the supplemental and concentration grants and the add-ons for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Grant Program and the Home to School Transportation Program, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8).

- **10. Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Current School Year:** This percentage will not be entered. The percentage is calculated based on the amounts of the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9) and the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants (6), pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8), plus the LCFF Carryover – Percentage from the prior year. This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the current LCAP year.

### Calculations in the Action Tables
To reduce the duplication of effort of LEAs, the Action Tables include functionality such as pre-population of fields and cells based on the information provided in the Data Entry Table, the Annual Update Summary Table, and the Contributing Actions Table. For transparency, the functionality and calculations used are provided below.

### Contributing Actions Table
- **4. Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (LCFF Funds)**
  - This amount is the total of the Planned Expenditures for Contributing Actions (LCFF Funds) column.

- **5. Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services**
  - This percentage is the total of the Planned Percentage of Improved Services column.

- Planned Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the coming school year (4 divided by 1, plus 5)

- This percentage is calculated by dividing the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) by the Projected LCFF Base Grant (1), converting the quotient to a percentage, and adding it to the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5).

## Contributing Actions Annual Update Table

Pursuant to EC Section 42238.07(c)(2), if the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) is less than the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants (6), the LEA is required to calculate the difference between the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5) and the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (7). If the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) is equal to or greater than the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants (6), the Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services will display “Not Required.”

- **6. Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants**
  - This is the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants the LEA estimates it will actually receive based on of the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the current school year.

- **4. Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (LCFF Funds)**
  - This amount is the total of the Last Year's Planned Expenditures for Contributing Actions (LCFF Funds).

- **7. Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions**
  - This amount is the total of the Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (LCFF Funds).

- **Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (Subtract 7 from 4)**
  - This amount is the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (7) subtracted from the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4).

- **5. Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (%)**
  - This amount is the total of the Planned Percentage of Improved Services column.

- **8. Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (%)**
  - This amount is the total of the Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services column.

- **Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (Subtract 5 from 8)**

<!-- Page 325 -->
- This amount is the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5) subtracted from the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (8)

## LCFF Carryover Table
- **10. Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Current School Year** (6 divided by 9 + Carryover %)
  - This percentage is the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants (6) divided by the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9) plus the LCFF Carryover – Percentage from the prior year.

- **11. Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services** (7 divided by 9, plus 8)
  - This percentage is the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (7) divided by the LCFF Funding (9), then converting the quotient to a percentage and adding the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (8).

- **12. LCFF Carryover — Dollar Amount LCFF Carryover** (Subtract 11 from 10 and multiply by 9)
  - If the Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (11) is less than the Estimated Actual Percentage to Increase or Improve Services (10), the LEA is required to carry over LCFF funds.
  
  The amount of LCFF funds is calculated by subtracting the Estimated Actual Percentage to Increase or Improve Services (11) from the Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (10) and then multiplying by the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9). This amount is the amount of LCFF funds that is required to be carried over to the coming year.

- **13. LCFF Carryover — Percentage** (12 divided by 9)
  - This percentage is the unmet portion of the Percentage to Increase or Improve Services that the LEA must carry over into the coming LCAP year. The percentage is calculated by dividing the LCFF Carryover (12) by the LCFF Funding (9).

# Superintendent's Message

San Juan Unified’s mission to empower all in our inclusive learning community to contribute and thrive in a radically evolving world must be guided by careful fiscal management that allows us to make strategic investments in our programs and services.

Over the past several years, one-time funds have allowed us to make crucial investments in supporting our students’ academic and social-emotional growth. We recognize that as this one-time funding will soon be coming to an end, we will need to make tough decisions on where to continue investments. Our team will spend this year working towards targeting our investments in areas that have been identified as having the most impact on our students and their success.

As I enter into my first full school year as superintendent of San Juan Unified, we will begin a strategic planning process to create an updated vision and direction for our district. We will be engaging with our community throughout this process, and I look forward to working collaboratively with our staff members, families, students and community members.

I am truly grateful for the San Juan Unified community’s continued support of our students and schools.

In community,

Melissa Bassanelli  
Superintendent of Schools

![Introduction 2023-24 Adopted Budget San Juan Unified School District](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Introduction+2023-24+Adopted+Budget+San+Juan+Unified+School+District)

**CORE MESSAGES**
- Governor Newsom released his revised 2023-24 budget on May 12, 2023. It reflects a shortfall of $31.5 billion, up from the $22.5 billion in the Governor’s Budget released in January 2023.
- The proposal includes a 8.22% COLA to the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and is applied to categorical programs such as special education and school nutrition.
- The Governor’s proposal also includes the use of approximately $2.7 billion one-time funds to support the overall LCFF costs in 2023-24.
- The May Revision extends the expenditure deadline for Expanded Learning Opportunity Program (ELOP) for funds received in 2021-22 and 2022-23 from June 30, 2023, to June 30, 2024.
- The May Revision continues to fully fund the first and second years of expanded eligibility for Transitional Kindergarten (TK) and allows the continuation of waiving family fees from July 1, 2023, through September 20, 2023, for the California State Preschool Program, using funds from the 2022 Budget Act.
- The district will be eligible for concentration grant funds in 2023-24.
- The district will continue to exercise caution and flexibility in long-term fiscal planning.

**SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION (SCOE)**
The Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) reviews all district budgets and interim budget reports. SCOE has an oversight obligation to monitor the district’s long-term fiscal health as prescribed in AB 1200. SCOE has provided the following guidance:
- Re-evaluate spending priorities to address student achievement and begin new initiatives only if long-term solvency can be maintained (avoid cycles of additions and reductions).
- Strategically invest stimulus funds to help students recover learning loss, provide wrap-around supports and reduce future operational costs.
- Exercise caution and maintain flexibility in collective bargaining process. Neighboring districts have widely divergent levels of funding. Consider increases to pension rates, rising health care costs, and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
- Maintain reserves greater than the minimum requirement.
- Support on-going expenditures with on-going revenues.

**PROPOSITION 55 AND THE EDUCATION PROTECTION ACT (EPA)**
Proposition 55 was passed by voters in November 2016. It extends the temporary personal income tax increase first enacted by Proposition 30. While the higher tax rates for high-income earners will be extended for an additional 12 years (though 2030), the sales tax increase expired at the end of 2016.
<!-- Page 335 -->
# STATE FUNDING AND AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE

California funds schools based on student attendance, also known as Average Daily Attendance (ADA). A student attending every day would equal one ADA. ADA is not the same as enrollment, which is the number of students officially enrolled in district schools. Average Daily Attendance is used to calculate a district’s proportionate share of state revenue from resources such as; the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), Special Education, and Lottery funds.

## San Juan Unified School District Funded ADA

| Year                | Funded ADA   |
|---------------------|--------------|
| 2021-22 Actual      | 37,497.75    |
| 2022-23 Actual      | 36,393.26    |
| 2023-24 Projected   | 35,282.08    |
| 2024-25 Projected   | 35,012.57    |
| 2025-26 Projected   | 35,201.03    |

## 2023-24 LCFF Funding Factors

Students are funded based on grade spans. Students in grades K-3 receive an adjustment for smaller class sizes as well as TK students commencing in 2022/23. Students in grades 9-12 receive an adjustment for Career Technical Education (CTE).

| Grade Span | 2022-23 Base Grant Per ADA | Grade Span Adjustment | 2022-23 Total Base Grant Per ADA |
|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| K-3        | $9,919                      | $1,032                | $10,951                           |
| 4-6        | $10,069                     | $9,037                |                                   |
| 7-8        | $10,367                     | $9,304                |                                   |
| 9-12       | $12,015                     | $312                  | $11,327                           |
| TK Add-on  | $9,919                      | $3,044                | $12,963                           |

![San Juan Unified School District 2023-24 Adopted Budget - Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) 2023-24 Budget Book Summary](https://example.com/image-url)

# What is the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)?
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) is a California law passed in 2013 that changed the method of distributing funds from the state to local school districts. LCFF funds include a base level grant for all Local Education Agencies (LEA) based on Average Daily Attendance. Additional funding is provided through supplemental and concentration grants based on the unduplicated number of high need students in the following categories: English learner, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and foster youth.

## Grants
### Supplemental Grants
Every student who is low-income, learning English, or in foster care generates 20% more funding above the base grant. These funds must be spent on increasing and improving services for these high-need student groups in order to increase their achievement.

### Concentration Grants
In districts where at least 55% of students are high-need, those high-need students above the 55% enrollment threshold generate an extra 50% of the base grant. These funds must be spent to increase or improve services for high-need students.

## Eight Areas of State Priority
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) also lists eight state priority areas that every district must address in their Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) to ensure a high-quality educational program for students focused on conditions for learning, engagement, and pupil outcomes.

### Conditions for Learning
- Basic Services
- Implementation of State Standards
- Course Access

### Engagement
- Parent Engagement
- Pupil Engagement
- School Climate

### Pupil Outcomes
- Pupil Achievement
- Other Pupil Outcomes

# What is the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP)?
In order to access the funds from the State of California, LEAs develop a Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) in partnership with their communities, families, students, staff, advisory committees, and labor partners. The LCAP is a three-year plan aligned to the Eight State Priorities that describes the goals, actions, services, and expenditures to address identified student needs with an emphasis on increasing or improving services for English learner, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and foster youth students.

![LCAP Focus Areas and Goals](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=LCAP+Focus+Areas+and+Goals)

**LCAP Focus Areas and Goals**  
Beginning with the 2019-2020 school year, San Juan launched an expansive listening and learning process as part of the development of a new district strategic framework and a new 3-year LCAP that resulted in the development of four focus areas and goals. These focus areas are aligned to the Eight State Priorities, drive our continuous improvement work across the district, and serve as San Juan’s LCAP plan goals.

- **Connected Schools**  
  Caring staff actively build community relationships, identify assets and needs, and connect students and families with resources to help them access the best opportunities our schools have to offer.

- **Healthy Environments**  
  All staff cultivate inclusive, safe, equitable, culturally responsive and healthy environments by integrating social and emotional learning to ensure essential student development.

- **Engaging Academics**  
  All educators engage and support each student in a challenging and broad course of study that builds skills, knowledge and experiences preparing all to be critical thinkers who communicate effectively, collaborate and are civic minded.

- **Clear Pathways**  
  Our whole school community engages each student in discovering their limitless potential, and through coordinated efforts prepares them for college, career and bright futures filled with opportunity.

---

**California School Dashboard**  
California has adopted state and local indicators to measure school district and individual school site performance in each of the state priorities. Performance data on state and local indicators is publicly reported on the California School Dashboard to provide parents and educators with information on school and district progress as well as assist in identifying strengths, challenges, and areas in need of improvement. State Indicators apply to all districts, schools, and student groups and are based on data that is collected consistently across the state whereas Local Indicators apply to districts and charters and are collected at the district level.

![Performance Indicator](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Performance+Indicator)  
**Red** - LOWEST PERFORMANCE  
**Orange**  
**Yellow**  
**Green**  
**Blue** - HIGHEST PERFORMANCE

# Budget, July 1
San Juan Unified  
2022-23 Estimated Actuals  
Indirect Cost Rate Worksheet  
34 67447 000000  
Form ICR  
E8B4MAYAYY(2023-24)

## Part I - General Administrative Share of Plant Services Costs
California's indirect cost plan allows that the general administrative costs in the indirect cost pool may include that portion of plant services costs (maintenance and operations costs and facilities rents and leases costs) attributable to the general administrative offices. The calculation of the plant services costs attributed to general administration and included in the pool is standardized and automated using the percentage of salaries and benefits relating to general administration as proxy for the percentage of square footage occupied by general administration.

### A. Salaries and Benefits - Other General Administration and Centralized Data Processing
1. Salaries and benefits paid through payroll (Funds 01, 09, and 62, objects 1000-3999 except 3701-3702)  
   (Functions 7200-7700, goals 0000 and 9000)  
   **$20,539,611.00**

2. Contracted general administrative positions not paid through payroll  
   a. Enter the costs, if any, of general administrative positions performing services ON SITE but paid through a contract, rather than through payroll, in functions 7200-7700, goals 0000 and 9000, Object $800.  
   b. If an amount is entered on Line A2a, provide the title, duties, and approximate FTE of each general administrative position paid through a contract. Retain supporting documentation in case of audit.

### B. Salaries and Benefits - All Other Activities
1. Salaries and benefits paid through payroll (Funds 01, 09, and 62, objects 1000-3999 except 3701-3702)  
   (Functions 1000-8999, 7100-7480, & 8100-8400; Functions 7200-7700, all goals except 0000 & 9000)  
   **$489,604,326.00**

### C. Percentage of Plant Services Costs Attributable to General Administration  
(Line A1 plus Line A2a, divided by Line B1; zero if negative) (See Part III, Lines A5 and A6)  
**4.20%**

## Part II - Adjustments for Employment Separation Costs
When an employee separates from service, the local educational agency (LEA) may incur costs associated with the separation in addition to the regular salary and benefits for the final pay period. These costs can be categorized as "normal" or "abnormal" or "mass" separation costs.

Normal separation costs include items such as pay for accumulated unused leave or routine severance pay authorized by governing board policy. Normal separation costs are not allowable as direct costs to federal programs, but are allowable as indirect costs. State programs may have similar restrictions. Where federal or state program guidelines require that the LEA charge an employee's normal separation costs to an unrestricted resource rather than to the restricted program in which the employee worked, the LEA may identify and enter these costs on Line A for inclusion in the indirect cost pool.

Abnormal or mass separation costs are those costs resulting from actions taken by an LEA to influence employees to terminate their employment earlier than they normally would have. Abnormal or mass separation costs include retirement incentives such as a Golden Handshake or severance packages negotiated to effect termination. Abnormal or mass separation costs may not be charged to federal programs as their direct costs or indirect costs. Where an LEA paid abnormal or mass separation costs on behalf of positions in general administrative functions included in the indirect cost pool, the LEA must identify and enter these costs on Line B for exclusion from the pool.

### A. Normal Separation Costs (optional)  
Enter any normal separation costs paid on behalf of employees of restricted state or federal programs that were charged to an unrestricted resource (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 1000-6999 or 8100-8400 rather than to the restricted program. These costs will be moved in Part III from base costs to the indirect cost pool. Retain supporting documentation.

### B. Abnormal or Mass Separation Costs (required)  
Enter any abnormal or mass separation costs paid on behalf of general administrative positions charged to unrestricted resources (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 7200-7700. These costs will be moved in Part III from the indirect cost pool to base costs. If none, enter zero.  
**$0.00**

## Part III - Indirect Cost Rate Calculation (Funds 01, 09, and 62, unless indicated otherwise)
### A. Indirect Costs
1. Other General Administration, less portion charged to restricted resources or specific goals  
   (Functions 7200-7600, objects 1000-5999, minus Line B9)  
   **$15,186,952.00**

2. Centralized Data Processing, less portion charged to restricted resources or specific goals  
   (Function 7700, objects 1000-5999, minus Line B10)  
   **$8,683,982.00**

Indirect Cost Rate Worksheet  

The need for LEAs to file amended federal reports when their actual indirect costs vary from the estimated indirect costs on which the approved rate was based.  
Where the ratio of indirect costs incurred in the current year is less than the estimated ratio of indirect costs on which the approved rate for use in the current year was based, the carry-forward adjustment is limited by either the approved rate times current year base costs, or the highest rate actually used to recover costs from any program times current year base costs, if the highest rate used was less than the approved rate. Rates used to recover costs from programs are displayed in Exhibit A.

A. Indirect costs incurred in the current year (Part III, Line A8)  
26,604,220.52  

B. Carry-forward adjustment from prior year(s)  
1. Carry-forward adjustment from the second prior year  
(2,841,726.78)  
2. Carry-forward adjustment deferred from prior year(s), if any  
(425,000.00)  

C. Carry-forward adjustment for under- or over-recovery in the current year  
1. Under-recovery: Part III, Line A8, plus carry-forward adjustment from prior years, minus (approved indirect cost rate (3.24%) times Part III, Line B19); zero if negative  
3,315,469.38  
2. Over-recovery: Part III, Line A8, plus carry-forward adjustment from prior years, minus the lesser of (approved indirect cost rate (3.24%) times Part III, Line B19) or (the highest rate used to recover costs from any program (3.24%) times Part III, Line B19); zero if positive  
0.00  

D. Preliminary carry-forward adjustment (Line C1 or C2)  
3,315,469.38  

E. Optional allocation of negative carry-forward adjustment over more than one year  
Where a negative carry-forward adjustment causes the proposed approved rate to fall below zero or would reduce the rate at which the LEA could recover indirect costs to such an extent that it would cause the LEA significant fiscal harm, the LEA may request that the carry-forward adjustment be allocated over more than one year. Where allocation of a negative carry-forward adjustment over more than one year does not resolve a negative rate, the CDE will work with the LEA on a case-by-case basis to establish an approved rate.  
1. Preliminary proposed approved rate (Part III, Line D) if entire negative carry-forward adjustment is applied:  
not applicable  
Option 2. Preliminary proposed approved rate (Part III, Line D) if one-half of negative carry-forward adjustment is applied to the current year calculation and the remainder is deferred to one or more future years:  
not applicable  
Option 3. Preliminary proposed approved rate (Part III, Line D) if one-third of negative carry-forward adjustment is applied to the current year calculation and the remainder is deferred to one or more future years:  
not applicable  

F. Carry-forward adjustment used in Part III, Line A9 (Line D minus amount deferred if Option 2 or Option 3 is selected)

**DATA ENTRY:** Enter an explanation if the standard is not met.

1a. **STANDARD NOT MET:** Projected P-2 ADA to enrollment ratio is above the standard for one or more of the budget or two subsequent fiscal years. Provide reasons why the projected ratio exceeds the district's historical average ratio by more than 0.5%.

**Explanation:**  
The District experienced a higher absenteeism rate in prior years due to COVID that decreased the historical average ratio for this criterion. Attendance rates are starting to recover and are anticipated to continue to move towards pre-COVID levels.

### 4. CRITERION: LCFF Revenue

**STANDARD:** Projected local control funding formula (LCFF) revenue for any of the budget year or two subsequent fiscal years has not changed from the prior fiscal year by more than the change in population, plus the district's gap funding or cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)* and its economic recovery target payment, plus or minus one percent.

For basic aid districts, projected LCFF revenue has not changed from the prior fiscal year by more than the percent change in property tax revenues plus or minus one percent.

* Districts that are already at or above their LCFF target funding as described in Education Code Section 42238.36(d) receive no gap funding. These districts have a COLA applied to their LCFF target, but their year-over-year revenue increase might be less than the statutory COLA due to certain local factors and components of the funding formula.

### 4C. Comparison of District LCFF Revenue to the Standard

**DATA ENTRY:** Enter an explanation if the standard is not met.

1a. **STANDARD NOT MET** - Projected change in LCFF revenue is outside the standard in one or more of the budget or two subsequent fiscal years. Provide reasons why the projection(s) exceed the standards and a description of the methods and assumptions used in projecting LCFF revenue.

**Explanation:** The District's LCFF funding for 23-24 is based using the 3 prior year average ADA and an 8.22% COLA that is higher than the standard. The 22-23 funding includes a COLA increase of 3.84%, which is also applied to the Add-On funding the district receives. The COLA was not previously applied to the Add-On funding, which is increasing the overall LCFF funding above the standard rate.

Identify new labor agreements, as well as new commitments provided as part of previously ratified multiyear agreements; and include all contracts, including all administrator contracts (and including all compensation). For new agreements, indicate the date of the required board meeting. Compare the increase in new commitments to the projected increase in ongoing revenues, and explain how these commitments will be funded in future fiscal years.

If salary and benefit negotiations are not finalized at budget adoption, upon settlement with certificated or classified staff, the school district must determine the cost of the settlement, including salaries, benefits, and any other agreements that change costs, and provide to the county office of education (COE) with an analysis of the cost of the settlement and its impact on the operating budget.

The county superintendent shall review the analysis relative to the criteria and standards, and may provide written comments to the president of the district governing board and superintendent.

![Education Protection Account (EPA)](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Education+Protection+Account+(EPA))

The Education Protection Account (EPA) provides local educational agencies (LEAs) with general purpose state aid funding pursuant to Proposition 30, the Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act of 2012, approved by the voters on November 6, 2012. Proposition 55 (2016), continues the use of EPA. The EPA funding is a component of an LEA's or Charter School’s total Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) revenue. Proposition 55 takes effect on January 1, 2018, and remains in effect through December 31, 2030.

The revenues generated from Propositions 30 and 55 are deposited into the EPA and a corresponding reduction is made to the district’s or charter school’s LCFF revenue. For 2023-24, the reduction is approximately 23% of the total LCFF funding. The district began receiving EPA payments quarterly in Fiscal Year 2013–14.

### Funding Before Proposition 30
- Local Taxes: 28%
- State Aid: 72%

### Funding After Proposition 30
- Local Taxes: 28%
- State Aid: 49%
- EPA: 23%

Proposition 30 requires that each LEA shall have sole authority to determine how the moneys received from the Education Protection Account are spent in the school or schools within its jurisdiction, provided, however, that the appropriate governing board or body shall make these spending determinations in open session of a public meeting of the governing board or body and shall not use any of the funds from the Education Protection Account for salaries or benefits of administrators or for any other administrative costs. An LEA may allocate the EPA entitlement entirely to one program for expenditure.

Propositions 30 and 55 require all districts, counties, and charter schools to report on their Web sites an accounting of how much money was received from the EPA and how that money was spent. District EPA information for previous years can be found by selecting the Budget Info link on the District’s website.

Listed on the next page is the Education Protection Account Expenditure plan listing how the moneys received from the Education Protection Account are proposed to be spent in 2023-24.

# GLOSSARY

This glossary provides definitions of current terms used in school business documents.

**Accounts Payable**  
Amounts due and owed to private persons, business firms, governmental units, or others for goods received and/or services rendered prior to the end of the fiscal year. Includes amounts billed but not paid. Does not include amounts due to other funds of the same school district.

**Accounts Receivable**  
Amounts due and owed the district from private persons, business firms, governmental units, or others for goods or services rendered by the district prior to the end of the fiscal year. Includes amounts billed but not received. Does not include amounts due from other funds of the same school district.

**Apportionments**  
State aid given to a school district or county office of education. Apportionments are calculated three times for each school year. The First Principal Apportionment (P-1) is calculated in February of the school year corresponding to the P-1 ADA (See Attendance Reports); the Second Principal Apportionment (P-2) is calculated in June corresponding to the P-2 ADA; and the annual recalculation of the apportionment is made in February following the school year and is based on P-2 ADA, except for programs where the annual count of ADA is used.

**Available Balance**  
Budgeted amount less expenditures to date and encumbrances.

**Average Daily Attendance (ADA)**  
The student days of actual attendance divided by the number of days school was in session. A student attending every day of school would equal one ADA. ADA is usually lower than enrollment due to factors such as students moving, dropping out, or staying home due to illness. The state uses a school district’s ADA to determine its general purpose revenue and other funding.

**Bond Measure**  
Bonds allow school districts to borrow funds to pay for a large capital investment—much as a person borrows to purchase a home. Districts can choose to seek bond passage with either a two-thirds vote or a 55% vote which requires greater accountability measures. The principal and interest are repaid by local property owners through an increase in property taxes. A simple majority of state voters may approve a state general obligation bond, which is repaid by state taxes and has no impact on property tax rates.

**Bonded Indebtedness**  
An obligation incurred by the sale of bonds for acquisition of school facilities or other capital expenditures. Since 1986, districts have been able to levy a local property tax to amortize bonded indebtedness provided the taxes are approved by a two-thirds vote of the electorate.

**Consumer Price Index (CPI)**  
A measure of the cost of living compiled by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Separate indexes of inflation are calculated regularly for the United States, California, some regions within California, and selected cities. The Consumer Price Index is one of several measures of economic change.

**Contribution**  
A term used in school finance to describe the situation in which a program’s costs surpass its funding, thus forcing school officials to use funds meant for other purposes to pay for these additional costs. Contributions occur in most districts which provide services for children with disabilities. Other contributions are caused by deficit factors or local decisions to allocate general purpose funds to special purpose programs.

**Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA)**  
An increase in funding for government programs, including revenue limits or categorical programs. Current law ties the COLA for most education programs to the annual percentage change in the “Implicit Price Deflator” for State and Local Governments – a government price index. (See Education Code Section 42238.1.)

**Deficit Spending**  
The amount by which total expenditures exceed total revenues for the fiscal year. Deficit spending results in a reduction of fund balance.

**Direct Support Charges**  
Charges for a support program and services that directly benefit other programs.

**Discretionary Funds**  
General purpose or unrestricted funds subject to local control.

**Encroachment**  
The expenditure of school districts’ general purpose funds in support of a categorical program, i.e. the categorical expenses encroaches into the district’s general fund for support. Encroachment occurs in most district and county offices that provide special education and transportation. Other encroachment is caused by local decisions to allocate general purpose funds to special purpose programs.

**Encumbrances**

**Ending Balance**

The ending balance is divided into restricted and unrestricted funds that a school district has remaining at the end of a fiscal year. A school district must have a Reserve for Economic Uncertainties within their ending balance which meets the criteria and standards minimums as established by the State Board of Education.

**Free/Reduced Price Meals**  
A federal program to provide food-typically lunch and/or breakfast- for students from low-income families. The number of students participating in the National School Lunch Program is often used as a way to measure the poverty level of a school or district population. The number of children in this program can affect schools’ or districts’ eligibility for grants or other funding aimed at helping lower-income families.

**Full Time Equivalent (FTE)**  
A term describing the percentage of day an employee works compared to a full day. 1.0 FTE is equal to a full day.

**Fund**

Accounting term used by the state and school districts to differentiate general revenues and expenditures from those placed in separate budget funds for specific uses.

**General Obligation Bonds (GO Bonds)**  
A local bond for renovating, reconstructing, and building new facilities or for acquiring certain new equipment. The principal and interest are repaid by local property owners through an increase in property taxes. School districts can seek either two thirds or 55% voter approval.

# Information
## 2023-24 Adopted Budget
### San Juan Unified School District

---

### Income
A term used in accounting for a proprietary fund type to represent the excess of revenues earned over the expenses incurred in carrying on the fund’s operations. The term “income” should not be used in lieu of revenue in governmental-type funds.

### Indirect Cost Rate
The rate set by the State to cover a portion of the general expenses of operating the district (overhead costs) to a specific grant or program. School districts may assess indirect costs to some state and federal grants.

### Interfund Transfers
Money that is taken from one fund under the control of the governing board and added to another fund under the board’s control. Interfund transfers are not revenue or expenditures of the school district.

### Liabilities
Legal obligations (with the exception of encumbrances) that are unpaid.

### Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) replaced the previous K-12 finance system in the fiscal year 2013-14. The LCFF includes the following components for school districts and charter schools:
- Provides an adjustment of 2.6 percent on the base grant amount for grades nine through twelve (9-12) and 10.4% on the base grant amount for grades K-3.
- Provides a supplemental grant equal to 20 percent of the adjusted base grant multiplied by the unduplicated percent of targeted disadvantaged students. Targeted students are those classified as English Learners (EL), eligible to receive a free or reduced-price meal (FRPM), foster youth, or any combination of these factors (unduplicated count).
- Provides a concentration grant equal to 50 percent of the adjusted base grant for targeted students exceeding 55 percent of an LEA’s enrollment.
- Add-ons equal to 2012-13 funding for Transportation and Targeted Instruction Improvement Block grant.

### OASDHI (Social Security)
The official name for Social Security is Old Age, Survivor, Disability, Health Insurance Act, sometimes abbreviated to OASDI or OADHI.

### Object
A term that applies to the expenditure classification of the article purchased or the service obtained.

### Principal Apportionment
Funding from the State School Fund for school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools. The Advance Principal Apportionment is certified by the Superintendent of Public Instruction in July of each school year, followed by the First Principal Apportionment (P1) in February, and the Second Principal Apportionment (P2) in June.

### Prior Year’s Taxes
Taxes collected within the current fiscal year for levies in previous fiscal years.

**Projections**  
Projected expenses based on spending patterns. Projected revenues based on current information.

**Program**  
A group of related activities that operate together to accomplish common ends.

**Proposition 98 (1988)**  
Voter-approved initiatives that amended the California constitution in 1988 and 1990 to guarantee a minimum amount of funding from property and state taxes for K-14 (kindergarten through community college) education each year. The propositions included formulas for calculating the guarantee under different economic conditions.

**Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS)**  
A retirement fund to which classified employees, their district, and the state must contribute according to California law.

**Regional Occupational Center Or Program (ROC/P)**  
A vocational educational program for high school students and adults. An ROC/P may be operated by a single district, by a consortium of districts under a joint powers agreement (JPA), or by a county office of education for the districts within that county.

**Reserves**  
Funds set aside in a school district budget to provide for future expenditures or to offset future losses, for working capital, or for other purposes.

**Revenue**  
Addition to assets not accompanied by an obligation to perform service or deliver products.

**Revolving Cash Fund**  
A stated amount of money used primarily for emergency or small or sundry disbursements and reimbursed periodically through properly documented expenditures, which are summarized and charged to proper accounting classifications.

**Special Education**  
Programs to identify and meet the educational needs of children with emotional, learning, or physical disabilities. Federal law requires that all children with disabilities be provided a free and appropriate education between 3 and 22 years of age.

**Standardized Account Code Structure (SACS)**  
As a result of legislation in 2000, all California school districts were required to convert to a new system of accounting for and reporting of school district revenues and expenditures. The new structure enables the state to electronically capture consistent data from district to district. Additionally, the new structure allows California data reporting to the federal government to be consistent with what other states are doing.

**State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS)**  
A retirement fund to which all certificated employees, school districts, and the state must contribute according to California law.

**Unappropriated Fund Balance**  
The portion of a fund balance not segregated for specific purposes. All assets and income available for appropriation are credited to the account and General Reserve; appropriations and obligations are debited. The net value of the account represents the unappropriated fund balance.

**Unduplicated Count**  
The number of pupils receiving special education or special services under the Master Plan for Special Education on the census dates of December 1 and April 1. (It also refers to the count of students who qualify for free or reduced price meals, English learners, or foster youth.) Even though a pupil may receive multiple services, each pupil is counted only once in the unduplicated count.

**Unencumbered Balance**  
That portion of an appropriation or allotment not yet expended or obligated.

**Unrestricted**  
May be used for general purpose.

### ACTION REQUESTED:  
The superintendent is recommending that the board hold a public hearing, review and adopt Resolution No. 4082 to permit temporary interfund borrowing of cash.  

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:  
Temporary interfund borrowing of cash is permitted by Education Code section (E.C.) 42603 for K-12 districts.  

E.C. 42603 states:  
. . . the governing board of any school district may direct that moneys held in any fund or account may be temporarily transferred to another fund or account of the district for payment of obligations. The transfer shall be accounted for as temporary borrowing between funds or accounts and shall not be available for appropriation or be considered income to the borrowing fund or account. Amounts transferred shall be repaid either in the same fiscal year or in the following fiscal year if the transfer takes place within the final 120 calendar days of a fiscal year. Borrowing shall occur only when the fund or account receiving the money will earn sufficient income, during the current fiscal year, to repay the amount transferred. No more than 85 percent of the maximum of moneys held in any fund or account during a current fiscal year may be transferred.  

This action would only be necessary should any fund have a temporary shortage of cash. Funds included:  
- General Fund  
- Charter Schools Fund  
- Adult Education Fund  
- Child Development Fund  
- Cafeteria Fund

**Section IV: Statement of Goals, Implementation Year Two Progress, and Course Corrections**

**Directions:** For each eligible participating school, please respond to the five questions. Please copy and paste the questions for LEAs with more than three school sites.

**Eligible Participating School #1:** Dyer-Kelly Elementary.

1. The “big picture” goals stated in the Literacy Action Plan (which can be located in Section 2: Literacy Action Plan Components).
   - Building capacity around our tier 1 ELA/ELD program (Benchmark) through LETRS training across K-3 grade levels.
   - Purchase and implement a supplemental foundational skills program, across K-3 grade levels.
   - Receive training on staff approved supplemental curriculum, across K-3 grade levels. Begin using supplemental curriculum in the classroom, across K-3 grade levels.
   - Improving student oral reading fluency with supplemental curriculum, across K-3 grade levels.

2. The actions the LEA and school site have taken to progress toward those goals in year two of the grant.
   - Building capacity around our tier 1 ELA/ELD program (Benchmark) through LETRS training across K-3 grade levels. - All K-3 teachers continued to progress in units 3 and 4 of LETRS. New K-3 teachers started LETRS training.
   - Implement (Purchase) a supplemental foundational skills program, across K-3 grade levels. - We purchased The 95% Group core phonics curriculum grades K-3 and The 95% Core Phonics Library for supplemental intervention materials. We also purchased University of Florida Literacy Institute (UFLI) manuals to bridge the gap between Heggerty and The 95% Group materials.
   - Receive training on staff approved supplemental curriculum, across K-3 grade levels. Begin using supplemental curriculum in the classroom, across K-3 grade levels. - The purchased materials are being utilized in K-3. Training was received, however, site funds (not ELSB) were used for this training.
   - Improving student oral reading fluency with supplemental curriculum, across K-3 grade levels. - Fluency is built into The 95% Group materials and UFLI. Utilizing automaticity assessments is still a goal, but has not yet been implemented.

3. The metrics the LEA and school site are using to measure progress on actions (implementation) and/or growth (student data). (Please include the year two results.)
   - The 95% Group Skills Phonics Screener for Intervention (PSI), i-Ready data both used site-wide.

**Implementation Year 2: 2022–23**

4. Please provide an analysis of the metrics and specifically, if the metrics are demonstrating progress towards goals.  
The PASI/PSI demonstrates that systematic phonics instruction is making a difference on students' phonological awareness and phonics knowledge. The PASI identifies holes in phonological and phonemic awareness understanding but is not as reflective to the challenges that language learners face related to the working memory part of the assessment that uses a word recall model and includes words that language learners may be unfamiliar with.  
The formative assessments embedded within the 95% phonics program intervention materials need to be applied more consistently across grade levels so that instructional adjustments can be made in a more timely manner.  

i-Ready is another source of data. Although it is not directly connected to 95% phonics instruction, the results demonstrate a growth in phonics and literacy knowledge. It also ensures we are aware of a need for comprehension and vocabulary development, other critical aspects of reading that we will be prioritizing during Implementation Year Three.

5. What changes are needed, if any, as the school site enters into year three?  
The metrics demonstrate consistent and strong growth with phonics, while also highlighting the need for comprehension and vocabulary development.  
We will need to be intentional in our conversations during the hiring process to articulate that there are site-wide agreements around instructional practices and professional development specific to literacy instruction, including LETRS. We will work with the newly hired ELSB K-3 Site Coach to offer support for new staff onboarding after hire. The ELSB K-3 Site Coach will also support literacy training for three newly hired ELSB K-3 Instructional Assistants (IA). These ELSB K-3 IAs will provide literacy instruction to small student groups who are not making adequate progress with our Universal Access Time.  
Our next steps in literacy instruction will need to be specific to comprehension and vocabulary development, as well as writing. This will include looking into instructional materials and/or practices that are in alignment with our phonemic, phonological, and phonics growth and allow us to capitalize on the growth made during Implementation Year 2.  
Our site will also need to increase K-3 teacher use of oral reading fluency assessments. We will need to garner site-wide agreement in the use of evidence-based assessment tools. We will also need to select a common assessment tool to ensure shared learning, calibration, and expectations are employed.

**Goal of the Early Literacy Support Block Grant**

The Goal of the Early Literacy Support Block Grant is to develop and implement literacy instruction and support programs, particularly focused on literacy in early grades (TK/K–3), ultimately resulting in improved student outcomes.

The ELSB Literacy Action Plan Template and Rubric are designed to work in tandem to support sites/LEAs in the development of a three-year literacy action plan to meet the goal of the grant. The Literacy Action Plan Template and Rubric Overview provides a snapshot of the process for developing the Literacy Action Plan. Use the Rubric for examples of evidence to include in the Literacy Action Plan.

**Section 1, the Planning Phase**, is required by statute and includes stakeholder engagement, root cause analysis, and a needs assessment.

**Section 2, Literacy Action Plan Components**, is also required by statute and includes the plan’s goals and actions, metrics, and expenditures that are aligned to the categories in Section 3.

**Section 3, Categories 1-4**, includes allowable programs and services. Plans must include one or more of the four categories based on the needs assessment.

The Expert Lead in Literacy will provide a step-by-step process from planning phase to plan approval, with expert technical assistance and ongoing support and feedback. Refer to the ELSB Grant Resources Padlet for additional support and resources.

| **1.1 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT**<br>The local educational agency shall consult with stakeholders, including school staff, school leaders, parents, and community members, at each eligible school about the root cause analysis and needs assessment and proposed expenditures of the grant funds. The local educational agency may use an existing school site council established pursuant to Section 65000 of the Education Code for this purpose. If the school site council is used for this purpose, the school shall provide public notice of meetings and shall conduct meetings in the manner required by Section 35147 of the Education Code. | Our proposal team solicited stakeholder engagement by creating a presentation of our proposal work to explain the purpose of this grant, our process in identifying the problem statement and our proposed plan to address the problem statement identified in the root cause analysis. The proposal of our plan shares our SMARTe objectives to address our problem statement.<br><br>Information about the ELSB grant has been shared with faculty and staff at the faculty meetings and the committee was formed to participate in sessions on writing the grant and presented at May, 2021, the school site council meeting. ELSB Grant Team, grade level leads, Categorical Programs Advisor and Local School Leadership Council met regularly to analyze data including Fountas and Pinnell scores, DIBELS, K-5 Assessment, Interim Assessment, iReady data to support the ELSB grant writing team with the Root Cause Analysis, Needs Assessment and collecting the evidence. The information about the early literacy grant as well as the needs assessment results were shared with parents at the School Site Council and Whole School Staff meetings. SSC members, teachers and parents provided input to refine literacy plans.<br><br>We solicited comments from the SSC members, teachers and parents provided input to refine literacy plans.<br><br>Parents supported the proposals to allocate funding for teachers x-time and professional development. Parents supported our motion to purchase additional materials and resources to enhance students' foundational reading skills. Parents discussed the effectiveness of the programs including comparison of electronic software and traditional literacy plans. | May Staff & Site Council Meeting (site council slide 6)<br>Site Council Meeting Minutes (Page 5)<br>Stakeholder Presentation (presented during staff meeting)<br>Staff Survey Results |

**1.2 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**  
The root cause analysis and needs assessment shall examine both school-level and local educational agency-level practices or unmet needs, including those relating to school climate, social-emotional learning, and the experience of pupils who are below grade-level standard on the English language arts content standards adopted by the State Board of printed materials. One parent mentioned having several children, the multiple supports we have and offer at Dyer-Kelly and specifically how “our site has a high number of EL students, however, the concern without having such strong programs in place and a variety of programs available many of our English as their primary language will fall behind.” As previously stated, this is an example of a statement informing and supporting our root cause analysis and needs assessment, showing a need for increased professional learning on explicit systematic foundational skill instruction, to in turn support students foundational gaps.

Through an in-depth data analysis we identified that few of our students are not able to decode complex grade-level texts by the end of third grade. Based on feedback from our parents, teachers and community and through analytical the development of our Root Cause Analysis we found a lack of consistent Phonemic Awareness and Oral Reading Fluency instruction, and agreed upon literacy assessments across our school site.

[Root Cause Analysis](#)  
[Student Data](#)  
<!-- Page 582 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Education and their families, that have contributed to low pupil outcomes for pupils in grade 3 on the consortium summative assessment in English language arts.

The root cause analysis and needs assessment shall identify the strengths and weaknesses of both the eligible school and the local educational agency with regard to literacy instruction in kindergarten and grades 1 to 3, inclusive. The local educational agency shall review all relevant diagnostic measures, including, but not limited to, pupil performance data, data on effective and ineffective practices, and equity and performance gaps.

### 1.3 NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The root cause analysis and needs assessment shall examine both school-level and local educational agency-level practices or unmet needs, including those relating to school climate, social-emotional learning, and the experience of pupils who are below grade-level standard on the English language arts content standards adopted by the State Board of Education and their families, that have contributed to low pupil outcomes for pupils in grade 3 on the consortium summative assessment in English language arts.

The root cause analysis and needs assessment shall identify the strengths and weaknesses of both the eligible school and the local educational agency with regard to literacy instruction in kindergarten and grades 1 to 3.

**Need 1:**
We will improve in deepening our understanding of our core program (Benchmark) by teaching with coherence and intention by utilizing LETRS™ with district support to fill foundational skill gaps. By acquiring a site literacy coach (2021-2024) and a district curriculum consultant (TOSA) as measured by ORF, iReady, staff observations, and feedback by June 2022.

**Rational of Need 1:**
Based on feedback from our parents, teachers and community and through analytical development of our root causes, we found it would be most formatively and summatively to support our teachers in deepening their individual pedagogical practices in foundational skills. As well as the practice utilizing common assessments to identify and assess students foundation needs.

[Needs Assessment](#)  
[Student Data](#)
<!-- Page 583 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1265.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Need 2:**
We, the teachers of Dyer-Kelly Elementary, will further improve our implementation of an explicit systematic foundational skill instructional (i.e. SIPPS, Open Court Foundational Skills, Heggerty phonemic awareness, word recognition for K-2; if needed) program across grade levels, K-3, by acquiring supplemental curriculum and training to support our year 1 goal of deepening our early literacy pedagogy as measured by data collections, collaborative lesson plans and peer observations by August 2022-June 2024.

**Rational of Need 2:**
Based on feedback from our parents, teachers and community and through analytical development, Year 2’s improvement goal continues work started in Year 1 by providing curriculum and professional development in explicit systematic foundational skill instruction to support the learning gaps identified in year 1 and support for student needs.

**Need 3:**
We, the teachers of Dyer-Kelly Elementary, will improve student oral reading fluency by showing that when asked, a STUDENT will read a short story independently with 95% oral reading accuracy and will answer 3 of 5 comprehension questions correctly, as measured by collecting data and growth monitoring in Fall, Winter and Spring trimester reading assessments and classroom data by August 2023-June 2024.

**Rational of Need 3:**
We currently do not have site wide consistent explicit instruction or assessments in foundational reading skills or Oral Reading Fluency. In year 3, based on feedback from our parents, teachers and community and through analytical development of our root causes, we will use common assessments tied to the new foundational skills curriculum from year 2. This assessment data will allow us to monitor and address foundational reading skill gaps site wide.

| Category 1 Descriptors | Action Item(s) | Evidence | Explanation/Rationale |
|------------------------|----------------|----------|-----------------------|
| **3.1a SUPPORT PERSONNEL**<br>Hiring of literacy coaches or instructional aides to provide support to struggling pupils, including, among others, bilingual reading specialists to support English learner programs. | **Example (action item):**<br>By September 2021, hire a literacy coach to work with students in grades K–3, focusing specifically on foundational reading skills using the SiPPs curriculum. | Connection to stakeholder engagement, root cause analysis, and needs assessment evident in identified metrics. | The plan includes strategies (effective practices), milestones (implementation indicators), actions (steps to the milestone), outputs (produced in completing actions), and a timeline (for completion of actions and meeting of milestones.) |
| | In support of goals 1, 2 and 3 by **August 2021**<br>**January 31, 2022**, hire a literacy coach to work with students in grades K–3, focusing specifically on foundational reading skills using the LETRS program, quarterly assessments support, and foundational skills program implementation.<br>Coach was contracted with Consortium on Reading Excellence (CORE) due to inability to fill position within school district. | As seen in our screening data [Student Data], our root cause analysis, and our Needs Assessment increased student access to targeted, evidence-based foundational reading skills instruction is an urgent need.<br>Attached is our job description for the hiring of our literacy coach [Site Resource Teacher - Literacy Coach]. | **Example (action item):**<br>A majority of our K–3 students are testing below proficiency in phonemic awareness and phonics according to our screening data. We need to become more targeted in our instructional practices in regards to foundational skills. A literacy coach will be utilized to coach teachers. |

| In support of goals 1, 2 and 3 by August 2021, acquire a LETRS TOSA to work with staff and literacy coach/CORE consultant focusing specifically on analyzing and supporting benchmark curriculum, across K-3 grade levels. | In support of goal 3 by September of 2022, find and purchase supplemental curriculum through a curriculum vetting process to the staff for feedback and analysis, across K-3 grade levels. Literacy Action Team will develop and facilitate a plan for literacy instruction and literacy intervention K-3. Currently, the Literacy Action Team members include site teachers from multiple grade levels, a site administrator, and a district administrator. Additional site teachers in grades K-3 will be compensated for time spent on this action item beyond their contractual hours, including training on the supplemental curriculum, literacy instruction, and literacy intervention. Developing the capacity of teachers to implement peer to peer coaching is also a key focus this year. Purchased supplemental curriculum: 95% Core Phonics program K-3 classroom kits and the Phonics Lesson Library. Evaluate effectiveness of this supplemental curriculum to determine if additional materials should be purchased. |

![SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION AGENDA ITEM: I-6](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SAN+JUAN+UNIFIED+SCHOOL+DISTRICT+BOARD+OF+EDUCATION+AGENDA+ITEM:+I-6)

**MEETING DATE:** 06/13/2023

**SUBJECT:** Special Education Community Advisory Committee Bylaw Revision  
**DEPARTMENT:** Administration  

**CHECK ONE:**  
For Discussion: ☐  
For Action: ☑  
Report: ☐  
Workshop: ☐  
Recognition: ☐  
Emergency Action: ☐  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending the board approve proposed revisions to the Special Education Community Advisory Committee bylaws.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The Special Education Community Advisory Committee bylaws were last updated in 2014. Recent legislative changes now allow for the committee to operate under the state’s Greene Act rather than the Brown Act while the board has expressed an interest to align practices and standards between committees to better establish expectations and the ability for members of the public to participate. The proposed revisions call out the committee’s use of the Greene Act and the district’s rules of order; reaffirm the authority, charge and function of the committee to provide input and feedback on the creation and updating of the special education local plan; and aligns practices on meeting dates, staff liaison support, membership selection, terms, officer election, annual organizational meeting, agenda development, public comments during meetings and processes for amendments with those of other board appointment committees. The proposed changes would move membership selection from a pure application process to an appointment by board member and superintendent process mirroring what is used for the LCAP Parent Advisory Committee. In reviewing initial drafts of the proposal, committee members expressed concern over limits to serving on only one committee, had questions around limits to three terms, and expressed a desire to ensure there were appropriate roles for maintaining parent majorities on the committee. Due to the significance of changes proposed, a redline version of the bylaws is not being provided.

## XV. Agendas
To provide consistency in how the public may expect to engage with district committees, the committee’s agenda and minutes format will mirror that of the school board and other appointed committees.

### A. Visitor comments
1. General visitor comments regarding topics not on the agenda shall be heard prior to regular committee discussion or action items.
2. Visitor comments related to an agendized item shall be heard after the item is presented but prior to discussion by the committee to allow for consideration of comments in the discussion.
3. Visitor comments will be limited to two minutes. Time shall be extended for those who use a translator or need other communication supports.
4. Visitors must submit a speaker card to the designated committee member or staff person at the meeting informing the committee of their interest to speak.

### B. Agenda Items
1. Agenda item requests from committee members shall be forwarded to the committee chairperson and staff liaison. If the chairperson and staff liaison jointly determine that the topic meets the charge of the committee, is aligned with current board priorities and staff resources are available, the item shall be placed on a future agenda. The superintendent or superintendent’s designee may also place an item on the committee agenda in preparation for a future board discussion.
2. If the chairperson and staff liaison are not in agreement that a requested agenda item meets the charge of the committee, is aligned with current board priorities or can be met with available staff resources, the question may be appealed to the superintendent who shall make a final determination.
3. To determine if a majority of the board would like committee input on a topic, the committee may, after majority vote, request that the board liaison present the topic to the board president and superintendent. At the discretion of the board president and superintendent, the item may be placed on a board agenda for discussion. A majority of the board, through action or consent, may or may not refer the topic back to the committee for further research and discussion.

### C. Posting Requirements
1. Agendas for all meetings must be posted to the committee’s webpage at least 72 hours prior to the meeting.
2. Members of the public who require agendas in an alternative format may request accommodations through the committee’s staff liaison.

# DRAFT

## XVI. Annual and Board Reports
A. The committee chairperson will prepare an annual summary report for the board no later than June 15 of each year.
   1. The report should compare committee activities and products with its charge and function.
   2. The report should be concise and of one to two letter-size pages.
   3. The report will outline work in progress, unforeseen issues and provide a summary of input and feedback collected by and generated from the committee.

B. The committee chairperson may provide update reports to the board on topics and business directly related to the committee’s work.
   1. Written updates may be delivered to board members via email.
   2. Time is provided on each regular agenda of the board of education for board-appointed and other district committees to provide updates. Because the specific committees and topics provided under this agenda item are not agendized in advance for public consideration, updates provided should be brief in nature and for the purpose of informing members of the board. If a topic requires or would benefit from significant board discussion or public participation, it must be agendized as a business item on the board agenda and should not be presented as a committee update report. As a courtesy, the committee chair should notify the staff liaison of their intent to provide an update at a board meeting no later than noon on the day of the meeting.

## XVII. Budget
The board will determine the budget, which will cover the operating cost of all board advisory committees.

## XVIII. Amendments
As the authorizing and appointing body, the Board of Education must approve changes to the committee bylaws. Amendments can be made in one of two ways:
A. A majority of the committee at a scheduled and agendized committee meeting may vote to recommend changes. The staff liaison will present changes supported by a majority vote of the committee to the superintendent for consideration and recommendation to the board.

B. District staff may propose revisions to align the bylaws with Board of Education interests, current practices or changes to legal requirements when necessary. Such recommendations will be presented to the committee for input and feedback prior to being placed on the board agenda for consideration.

Adopted by the Board of Education June 13, 2023

**San Juan Unified School District**

**Policy 5141.52: Suicide Prevention**  
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/27/2017 | **Last Revised Date:** 11/17/2020 | **Last Reviewed Date:** 11/17/2020

The Governing Board recognizes that suicide is a leading cause of death among youth; prevention is a collective effort that requires stakeholder engagement, and that school personnel who regularly interact with students are often in a position to recognize the warning signs of suicide and to offer appropriate referral and/or assistance. To attempt to reduce suicidal behavior, its impact on students and families and other trauma associated with suicide, the superintendent or designee shall develop measures, strategies, practices, and supports for suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention.

In developing policy and strategies for suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention, the superintendent or designee shall consult with school and community stakeholders such as administrators, other staff, parents/guardians, and students; school-employed mental health professionals such as school counselors, school psychologists, school social workers, and school nurses; suicide prevention experts such as local health agencies, mental health professionals, and community organizations; law enforcement; and, in developing policy for grades K-6, the county mental health plan. (Education Code section 215)

The board shall ensure that measures and strategies for students in grades K-6 are age appropriate and delivered and discussed in a manner that is sensitive to the needs of young students. (Education Code section 215)

Measures and strategies for suicide prevention, intervention, and postvention shall include, but are not limited to:

1. Staff development on suicide awareness and prevention for teachers, interns school counselors, and other district employees who interact with students, including, as appropriate, substitute teachers, coaches, expanded day learning staff, crossing guards, tutors, and volunteers, as described in the accompanying administrative regulation.

2. Instruction to students in problem-solving, coping, and resiliency skills to promote students' mental, emotional, and social health and well-being, as well as instruction in recognizing and appropriately responding to warning signs of suicidal intent in others.

3. Methods for promoting a positive school climate that enhances students' feelings of connectedness with the school and that is characterized by caring staff and harmonious interrelationships among students.

4. The review of materials and resources used in awareness efforts and communications to ensure they align with best practices for safe and effective messaging about suicide.

5. The provision of information to parents/guardians regarding risk and protective factors, warning signs of suicide, the severity of the youth suicide problem, the district's suicide prevention policy and procedures, basic steps for helping suicidal youth, the importance of communicating with appropriate staff if suicide risk is present or suspected, access to suicide prevention training, and/or school and community resources that can help youth in crisis.

6. Encouragement for students to notify appropriate school personnel or other adults when they are experiencing thoughts of suicide or when they suspect or have knowledge of another student's suicidal intentions. 

**616**
<!-- Page 617 -->
7. Crisis intervention procedures for addressing suicide threats or attempts.

8. Counseling and other postvention strategies for helping students, staff, and others cope in the aftermath of a student's suicide.

9. Establishment of district and/or school-site crisis intervention team(s) to ensure the proper implementation and review of this policy and other district practices related to the emotional and behavioral wellness of students, including, but not limited to, the oversight of mental health and suicide prevention training, collaboration with community mental health organizations, identification of resources and organizations that provide evidence-based treatment, collaboration to build community response, and compliance with Education Code section 215.

As appropriate, these measures and strategies shall specifically address the needs of students who are at high risk of suicide, including, but not limited to, students who are bereaved by suicide; students with disabilities, mental illness, or substance use disorders; students who are experiencing homelessness or who are in out-of-home settings such as foster care; and students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or questioning youth. (Education Code section 215)

**Suicide Prevention Explanation for TK-6th Grade**

San Juan Unified School District wants to keep all students safe. We have people who can help if you are not feeling okay.

We work together with the county mental health plan so students can get free help if they need it.

We also have ways to get help on our website at: https://www.sanjuan.edu/suicideprevention

We can help all students, including those who:
- Feel sad or depressed;
- Feel anxious or upset;
- Have lost someone to suicide;
- Are disabled;
- Have mental illness;
- Have substance use disorders;
- Are homeless or in and out-of-home settings like foster care; or
- Who are LGBTQ

To keep students healthy and prevent self-harm, San Juan Unified School District uses Second Step and Signs of Suicide to teach students:
- To be mindful of their self and their feelings;
- How to be kind to everyone;
- How to make good decisions;
- What to do if someone is being mean or a bully;
- How to ask for help;
- How to get help for others; and

If you need help or someone to talk to you can ask a school staff person for help. School staff can only help within the authorization and scope of their credential or license. Only
<!-- Page 618 -->
those with the right training and license can diagnose or treat mental illness. Every staff person, however, must be kind and caring.

School staff are trained by experts to help:

• Look for students who are in crisis or display warning signs;  
• Find the right mental health services at school and outside school; and  
• Refer students and families to those services.

If school staff hear or see any warning signs, they will ask a counselor to help the student. Any student who is in crisis will not be left alone. The school counselor will decide the risk of harm and how best to help the student.

If students try to hurt themselves at school, staff will:

• Remain calm and let the principal know what is happening;  
• Get emergency medical services for the student;  
• Be caring and stay with the student until help arrives;  
• Offer help to the student and their family; and  
• Help the student come back to school when they are ready.

If students try to hurt themselves away from school, staff will:

• Let the principal know what is happening;  
• Offer help to the student and their family; and  
• Help the student come back to school when they are ready.

After a student has or knows someone who has had a crisis, staff will:

• Share what happened with only those who need to know;  
• Make a plan with the family to help the student;  
• Help the student make up any missed work;  
• Be caring and help the student in school; and  
• Follow up with the student and family often to see what help is needed.

If someone dies by suicide staff will:

• Send a team to the school to help anyone who is in need, and  
• Offer help to any families who are in need.

If any student ever needs help, they can:

• Ask any staff person for help;  
• Fill out a school request for help form;  
• Text NAMI to 741-741 to be connected to a free, trained crisis counselor on the Crisis Text Line;  
• Call the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) at 1-800-950-6264  
• Call the Crisis Hotline at 1-800-991-5272; or  
• Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255

If a referral is made for mental health or related services for a student in grade K-6 who is a Medi-Cal beneficiary, the superintendent or designee shall coordinate and consult with the county mental health plan. (Education Code 618)

section 215)

District employees shall act only within the authorization and scope of their credential or license. Nothing in this policy shall be construed as authorizing or encouraging district employees to diagnose or treat mental illness unless they are specifically licensed and employed to do so. (Education Code section 215)

The board shall review, and update as necessary, this policy at least every five years. (Education Code section 215)

The superintendent or designee shall post this policy on the district's web site, in a prominent location and in a manner that is easily accessible to parents/guardians and students. (Education Code section 234.6)

![Board Policy Manual](https://via.placeholder.com/768x971.png?text=Board+Policy+Manual)

**Policy 5141.33: Head Lice**  
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992  
**Child Care Facilities, rev. March 2012**  
**San Juan Unified School District**

Because head lice are not uncommon and are easily spread, the Superintendent or designee shall send information about the treatment and control of head lice to parents/guardians as needed to prevent the spread of infestations. As part of the health curriculum, teachers shall stress the importance of preventive measures.

The Governing Board recognizes that the responsibility for the treatment of head lice rests with the home. When lice or untreated nits are found, the student shall be sent home as soon as possible with proper parental notification.

*(cf. 5112.2 - Exclusions from Attendance)*

Staff shall make every effort to maintain the privacy of students identified as having head lice and excluded for treatment.

The Governing Board recognizes that head lice infestations among students require treatment but do not pose a risk of transmitting disease. The superintendent or designee shall encourage early detection and treatment in a manner that minimizes disruption to the educational program and reduces student absences.

The superintendent or designee may distribute information to parents/guardians of students regarding routine screening, symptoms, accurate diagnosis, and proper treatment of head lice infestations. The superintendent or designee may also provide related information to school staff.

School employees shall report all suspected cases of head lice to the school nurse or designee as soon as possible.

If a student is found with active adult head lice, they shall be allowed to stay in school until the end of the school day. The parent/guardian of any such student shall be given information about the treatment of head lice and encouraged to begin treatment of the student immediately and to check all members of the family. The parent/guardian also shall be informed that the student shall be checked upon return to school the next day and allowed to remain in school if no active head lice are detected.

Upon the student's return to school, the school nurse or designee shall check the student for active head lice. If it is determined that the student remains infected with head lice, the school nurse or designee shall contact the student's parent/guardian to discuss treatment. As needed, staff may provide additional resources and/or referral to the local health department, health care providers, or other agencies.

If a student is found consistently infested with head lice, they may be referred to a multidisciplinary team, which may consist of the school nurse, representatives from the local health department and social services, and other appropriate individuals to determine the best approach for identifying and resolving problems contributing to the student's head lice infestations.

When it is determined that one or more students in a class or school are infested with head lice, the principal or designee may, at their discretion, notify parents/guardians of students in that class or school and provide them with information about the detection and treatment of head lice.
