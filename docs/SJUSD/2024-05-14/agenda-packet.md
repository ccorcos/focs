![San Juan Unified School District New High School Courses for 2024-2025 Rationale/Background](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=San+Juan+Unified+School+District+New+High+School+Courses+for+2024-2025+Rationale/Background)

**Advanced Placement (AP) Physics C - Mechanics (A-G):**  
AP Physics C: Mechanics is equivalent to a one-semester, calculus-based, college-level physics course, especially appropriate for students planning to specialize or major in physical science or engineering. The course explores topics such as kinematics; Newton’s laws of motion; work, energy, and power; systems of particles and linear momentum; circular motion and rotation; and oscillations and gravitation. Introductory differential and integral calculus is used throughout the course. (“d”) (District)

**Advanced Placement (AP) Pre-Calculus (A-G):**  
In AP Precalculus, students explore everyday situations using mathematical tools and lenses. Through regular practice, students build deep mastery of modeling and functions, and they examine scenarios through multiple representations. They will learn how to observe, explore, and build mathematical meaning from dynamic systems, an important practice for thriving in an ever changing world. AP Precalculus prepares students for other higher-level mathematics and science courses. The framework delineates content and skills common to college precalculus courses that are foundational for careers in mathematics, physics, biology, health science, social science, and data science. (“c”) (District)

**Art and Ethnic Studies (A-G):**  
In this Art & Ethnic Studies course, students will develop and cultivate respect, empathy, and solidarity with historically marginalized groups of people reflected in our local demographics (Native Americans, African Americans, Latino/a/x Americans, and Asian & Pacific Islander Americans, among others) through developing Visual Arts including (but not limited to) drawing, painting, collage, murals, photography, public art, and mixed media. This survey course would provide a foundation that future classes could build upon for a more in-depth exploration of art forms in varying cultures and communities. (“f”) (“non a-g”) (Del Campo)

**Data Science (A-G):**  
In this course, students will learn to understand, ask questions, and represent data through project-based units. The units will give students opportunities to be data explorers through active engagement, developing their understanding of data analysis, sampling, correlation/causation, bias, and uncertainty, modeling with data, making and evaluating data-based arguments, and the importance of data in society. At the end of the course, students will have a portfolio of their data science work to showcase their newly developed knowledge and understanding. The curriculum will be adaptable so that teachers can either use the data sets provided or bring in data sets most relevant to their own students. We will apply for A-G approval of the course, which would mean the course can be taken as an alternative to Algebra 2, or in addition to Algebra 2. (“c”) (Del Campo)

**English 3: Ethnic Studies (A-G):**  
Students in the English 3 Ethnic Studies course read and analyze a broad range of nonfiction and fiction selections, deepening their awareness of how language works in effectively communicating an idea. Additionally, this course aims to educate students to be civically, socially, and economically conscious through the themes of identity, history and movement, systems of power, and social movements and equity. By studying the historic struggle of communities of color, taking into account the intersectionality of identity, students will develop respect and empathy for individuals and groups of people locally, nationally, and globally to build self-awareness, empathy, and foster active social engagement.

FEEDBACK RESULTS  

10. Considering the needs of district students, what are the strengths and limitations of the recommended materials?  

**Strengths**  
- Substantial amount of authentic material in written and audio forms  
- Sources come from real life situations, interviews, advertisements and include varied accents from around Spanish-speaking countries  
- Each unit is scaffolded into manageable chunks that will ultimately conclude with an end-of-unit assessment  
- Each “TEMA” (theme/topic) has subtopics “CONTEXTOS” that align with AP Spanish Language and Culture course themes. They also allow for a more in depth understanding of the topics.  
- End of unit assessment and other assessments and activities mirror the skills needed to prepare for the proficiencies required on the AP Exam  

**Limitations**  
- Material and sources can become outdated quickly  
- More differentiation to support student learning differences would be helpful  
- There is a lot of content--a pacing guide would help best use of the materials  

11. What were the results of the evaluation and what are the recommended materials?  
The teacher evaluated the materials based on the Key Indicators and recommended Temas, 3rd Edition.

AGENDA ITEM: G-9

**SUBJECT:** 2022-2023 Audit Reports for Measures J, N, P and S  
**DEPARTMENT:** Fiscal Services  

**CHECK ONE:**  
For Discussion: ☐  
For Action: ☑  
Report: ☐

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board accept the 2022-2023 Audit Reports for Measures J, N, P and S as prepared by Gilbert Associates, Inc. (the district’s independent auditor for Measures J, N, P and S).  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Each year the agreed-upon procedures for Measure S and the annual financial and performance audit for Measures J, N and P general obligation bonds are conducted by the district’s outside auditor. Measures J, N and P are subject to the requirements of Proposition 39, passed in 2000. These audits are for the bond funds for the year ending June 2023 and are conducted in accordance with the Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.  

Gilbert Associates, Inc., has expressed its opinion, “The financial statements referred to Measures J, N and P present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Measures J, N and P Building Fund of the district, as of June 30, 2023, and the changes in financial position thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.”  

As for the performance audit report, Gilbert concluded that, “Based upon the procedures performed, we found that, for the items tested, the San Juan Unified School District has properly accounted for the expenditures of Measures J, N and P General Obligation Bonds.”

# INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS REPORT ON APPLYING AGREED-UPON PROCEDURES

**Board of Education**  
San Juan Unified School District  
3738 Walnut Avenue  
Carmichael, California 95609-0477  

We have performed the procedures enumerated below on San Juan Unified School District (District) management’s assertions concerning Measure "S" ballot language and San Juan Unified School District Board of Education Resolution No. 2090 as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023. District management is responsible for evaluating assertions concerning Measure "S" ballot language and San Juan Unified School District Board of Education Resolution No. 2090.

The Board of Education has agreed to and acknowledged that the procedures performed are appropriate to meet the intended purpose of the engagement, which is to assist in evaluating San Juan Unified School District management assertions concerning Measure “S” ballot language and Resolution No 2090 for the year ended June 30, 2023.

A. That "Measure S Bond funds are spent only on school improvements, not on District salaries or administration."

B. That the District has continued "funding the Deferred Maintenance Program at a level of no less than $2 million annually."

C. That the District has funded "housekeeping and maintenance and operations budgets as necessary to properly maintain all District facilities."

This report may not be suitable for any other purpose. The procedures performed may not address all the items of interest to a user of this report and may not meet the needs of all users in this report and, as such, users are responsible for determining whether the procedures performed are appropriate for their purposes.

The procedures and associated findings are as follows:

A. We obtained the Measure S Building Fund detailed general ledger for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. We applied the following procedures to this report:

1. Recomputed subtotals and totals of the report. No exceptions noted.

2. Reviewed the detailed general ledger for unallowable expenditures. No exceptions noted.

B. The District's Deferred Maintenance Program was funded at an amount of $2 million for the 2022-2023 fiscal year, which meets the requirement of at least $2 million annually. The $2 million was transferred from the General Fund. We agreed these totals to the District's audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023. No exceptions noted.

C. On June 28, 2022, the 2022-23 Budget was adopted by the Board of Education. Included in the 2022-23 Budget is the School District Criteria and Standards Review. The standard for criterion 7 is to “confirm that the annual contribution for facilities maintenance funding is not less than the amount required pursuant to Education Code Section 17070.75, if applicable, and that the district is providing adequately to preserve the functionality of its facilities for their normal life in accordance with Education Code sections 52060(d)(1) and 17002(d)(1).” The District met this standard and fulfilled the requirement for budgeting for the Restricted Routine Maintenance Account. For the year ended June 30, 2023, the District fulfilled the requirement by transferring $15,852,237 from the General Fund Unrestricted accounts to General Fund Restricted Routine Maintenance Account. No exceptions noted.  

We were engaged by the District to perform this agreed-upon procedures engagement and conducted our engagement in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. We were not engaged and did not conduct an examination or review engagement, the objective of which would be the expression of such an opinion or conclusion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion or conclusion. Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that would have been reported to you.  

We are required to be independent of the District and to meet our ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements related to our agreed-upon procedures engagement.  

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Education and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

Independent Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee  
and Board of Education  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

## Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

### Opinion

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Measure J Building Fund of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Measure J Building Fund of the District as of June 30, 2023, and the changes in financial position for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

### Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

### Emphasis of Matter

As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements present only the Measure J Building Fund, and do not purport to, and do not present fairly the financial position of the District as of June 30, 2023, or the changes in its financial position for the year ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

### Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

**Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards**

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated April 15, 2024, on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

### NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
#### JUNE 30, 2023  

As of June 30, 2023, total outstanding debt related to Measure J is $41,774,932.  

The Board of Supervisors of Sacramento County is empowered and obligated to annually levy ad valorem taxes, without limitation as to rate or amount, upon all property subject to taxation within the District (except for certain property which is taxable at limited rates), for payment of interest and principal of the Bonds when due. The District has established separate debt service funds to account for the collection and remittance of bond principal and interest payments. Additional information on the bonds’ payment schedules can be found in the District’s financial statements.  

## 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

**Basis of presentation** – The District accounts for its financial transactions in accordance with the policies and procedures of the California Department of Education's California School Accounting Manual. The accounting policies of the District conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  

**Measurement focus and basis of accounting** – Measurement focus indicates the type of resources being measured, while the basis of accounting indicates the timing of transactions or events for recognition in the financial statements. The Measure J Building Fund is a governmental fund, and has been presented using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available, and are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the District considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Expenditures are generally recorded when the related liability is incurred.  

**Cash and cash equivalents** – For the purpose of the financial statements, cash equivalents are defined as financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less.  

**Restricted cash and cash equivalents** – Cash that is externally restricted to purchase or construct capital or other assets is classified as a restricted asset in the balance sheets.  

**Restricted fund balance** – Restricted fund balance includes resources which are legally or contractually restricted by external third parties. Fund balance is restricted for capital projects of the Measure J Building Fund in accordance with the project list for the 2002 General Obligation Bonds.  

**Estimates used in financial reporting** – In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

### 3. RESTRICTED CASH AND EQUIVALENTS  

Cash and equivalents as of June 30, 2023, consist of the following:  

- Cash and equivalents with County Treasury  $ 12,377,677  
- Cash and equivalents with fiscal agents  1,895  
- **Total cash and equivalents**  $ 12,379,572  

**Cash and equivalents in County Treasury** – The Measure J Building Fund maintains cash in the Sacramento County Treasury (the Treasury). The Treasury pools funds with those of other districts in the county and invests the cash. The share of each fund in the pooled cash account is separately accounted for and interest earned is apportioned quarterly based on the relationship of a fund’s daily balance to the total of pooled cash and investments.  

Participants’ equity in the Treasury investment pool is determined by the dollar amount of the participant deposits, adjusted for withdrawals and distributed income.  

The Treasury is authorized to deposit cash and invest excess funds by California Government Code Section 53648 et seq. and is restricted by Government Code Section 53635, pursuant to Section 53601.  

**Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent** – Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent are held by the Treasury and represent bond proceeds restricted for capital projects.  

**Derivative investments** – The Measure J Building Fund did not directly enter into any derivative investments. Information regarding the amount invested in derivatives by the Treasury was not available.  

**Interest rate risk** – Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to changes in market interest rates. As of June 30, 2023, weighted average maturity of the investments contained in the Treasury is approximately 267 days.  

**Credit risk** – Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. This is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The Treasury investment pool does not have a rating provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  

**Custodial credit risk** – Custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, a government will not be able to recover its deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. The California Education Code and the District’s investment policy do not contain legal or policy requirements that would limit the exposure to custodial credit risk for deposits other than the following provision for deposits: The California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits that are made by state or local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral pool held by a depository regulated under state law (unless so waived by the governmental unit). The market value of the pledged securities in the collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total amounts deposited by the public agencies.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

**Independent Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee and Board of Education San Juan Unified School District Carmichael, California**

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the Measure J Building Fund of the San Juan Unified School District (the District), which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated April 15, 2024.

## Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements, on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified.

**Report on Compliance and Other Matters**

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Purpose of This Report**

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the organization’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

**Board of Education and Independent Citizens’ Bond**  
**Oversight Committee for Measure J**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Carmichael, California**

We have conducted a performance audit of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) Measure J General Obligation Bonds for the year ended June 30, 2023.

We conducted our performance audit in accordance with Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for the findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Our audit was limited to the objectives listed on page 2 of this report which includes determining compliance with the performance requirements for the Proposition 39 and Measure J General Obligation Bonds under the applicable provisions of Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution and Proposition 39 as they apply to the bonds and the net proceeds thereof. Management is responsible for the District’s compliance with those requirements.

Solely to assist us in planning and performing our performance audit, we obtained an understanding of the internal controls of the District to determine if internal controls were adequate to help ensure the District’s compliance with the requirements of Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution. Accordingly, we do not express any assurance on the internal controls.

The results of our tests indicated that, in all significant respects, the San Juan Unified School District expended Measure J General Obligation Bond funds for the year ended June 30, 2023 only for the specific projects developed by the District’s Board of Trustees and approved by the voters, in accordance with the requirements of Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution.

As of June 30, 2023, total outstanding debt related to Measure J is $41,774,932.

The financial activity related to the Measure J General Obligation Bonds is recorded in sub-Fund 23 (Measure J Building Fund) of Fund 21 (Building Fund) in the District's audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023.

**PROCEDURES PERFORMED**

We obtained the Measure J Building Fund detailed general ledger for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. We obtained the actual invoices and other supporting documentation for a sample of expenditures to ensure compliance with Proposition 39 and Measure J General Obligation Bond funding. We performed the following procedures:

- We verified the mathematical accuracy of the expenditures included in the Measure J Building Fund detailed general ledger for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.

- Solely to assist us in planning and performing our performance audit, we obtained an understanding of the internal controls of the District to determine if internal controls are adequate to help ensure the District’s compliance with the requirements of Proposition 39.

- We determined that the Independent Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee is fulfilling its duties as required by Education Code 15278 and as outlined in their Committee Bylaws.

- We selected a sample of 16 expenditures in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The sample was selected to provide a representation across construction projects, vendors, and expenditure amounts. For each selection, we performed the following procedures:
  1. Reviewed supporting documentation to ensure that funds were properly expended on the specific projects outlined on the publicized list and met the requirements for bidding, if applicable.
  2. Verified the expenditure was for construction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, including furnishing and equipping of District facilities, deferred maintenance upgrades or the acquisition or lease of real property facilities and verified that funding was not used for salaries of school administrators or other operating expenditures of the District.

The District incurred expenditures of $1,612,781 for the year ended June 30, 2023, for the Measure J projects listed in the following Schedule of Activities.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

Independent Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee  
and Board of Education  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**

**Opinion**  
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Measure N Building Fund of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Measure N Building Fund of the District as of June 30, 2023, and the respective changes in financial position for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Basis for Opinion**  
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Emphasis of Matter**  
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements present only the Measure N Building Fund and do not purport to and do not present fairly the financial position of the District as of June 30, 2023, or the changes in its financial position for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**  
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

**Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards**

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated April 15, 2024, on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and to not provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

### JUNE 30, 2023  

1. **ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF ACTIVITIES**  

The San Juan Unified School District (the District) was established in 1960 and serves a 75-square mile area covering the communities of Arden-Arcade, Carmichael, Citrus Heights, Fair Oaks, Gold River, and Orangevale. The District currently operates 65 schools and provides early learning, kindergarten through 12th grade, and adult program education to approximately 40,000 students.  

These financial statements present only the Measure N General Obligation Bonds Building Fund, which is recorded in sub-Fund 24 (Measure N Building Fund) of Fund 21 (Building Fund) in the District's audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023. These financial statements do not include financial data for the remainder of the District’s funds and component unit, which accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require to be presented with the financial statements of the District.  

On November 6, 2012, the electorate of the San Juan Unified School District approved the $350 million Measure N general obligation bonds with greater than 55% of the votes in favor.  

- On January 13, 2013, the District issued General Obligation Bonds Election of 2012, Series A (Series A Bonds) in the amount of $20,000,000 to build, acquire, construct, and furnish school facilities. The bonds matured during succeeding years through August 2015. The bonds were issued at an interest rate of 1.00%.  

- On July 1, 2014, the District issued General Obligation Bonds Election of 2012, Series B (Series B Bonds) in the amount of $80,000,000 to build, acquire, construct, and furnish school facilities. The bonds mature during succeeding years through August 2027. The bonds were issued at interest rates ranging from 1.00% to 4.00%.  

- On March 7, 2017, the District issued General Obligation Bonds Election of 2012, (Series 2017 Bonds) in the amount of $70,000,000 to finance specific construction, acquisition, and modernization projects.

interest and principal of the Bonds when due. The District has established separate debt service funds to account for the collection and remittance of bond principal and interest payments. Additional information on the bonds’ payment schedules can be found in the District’s financial statements.

## 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

**Basis of presentation** – The District accounts for its financial transactions in accordance with the policies and procedures of the California Department of Education's California School Accounting Manual. The accounting policies of the District conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

**Measurement focus and basis of accounting** – Measurement focus indicates the type of resources being measured, while the basis of accounting indicates the timing of transactions or events for recognition in the financial statements. The Measure N Building Fund is a governmental fund, and has been presented using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available, and are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the District considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Expenditures are generally recorded when the related liability is incurred.

**Cash and cash equivalents** – For the purpose of the financial statements, cash equivalents are defined as financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less.

**Restricted cash and cash equivalents** – Cash that is externally restricted to purchase or construct capital or other assets is classified as a restricted asset in the balance sheet.

**Restricted fund balance** – Restricted fund balance includes resources which are legally or contractually restricted by external third parties. Fund balance is restricted for capital projects of the Measure N Building Fund in accordance with the project list for the 2012 General Obligation Bonds.

**Estimates used in financial reporting** – In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

### 3. RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  

Cash and equivalents as of June 30, 2023, consist of the following:  

- Cash and equivalents with County Treasury: $ 4,134,140  
- Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent: $ 10,298,314  
- **Total cash and equivalents:** $ 14,432,454  

**Cash and equivalents in County Treasury** – The Measure N Building Fund maintains cash in the Sacramento County Treasury (the Treasury). The Treasury pools funds with those of other districts in the county and invests the cash. The share of each fund in the pooled cash account is separately accounted for and interest earned is apportioned quarterly based on the relationship of a fund’s daily balance to the total of pooled cash and investments.  

Participants’ equity in the Treasury investment pool is determined by the dollar amount of the participant deposits, adjusted for withdrawals and distributed income.  

The Treasury is authorized to deposit cash and invest excess funds by California Government Code Section 53648 et seq. and is restricted by Government Code Section 53635, pursuant to Section 53601.  

**Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent** – Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent are held by the Treasury and represent bond proceeds restricted for capital projects.  

**Derivative investments** – The Measure N Building Fund did not directly enter into any derivative investments. Information regarding the amount invested in derivatives by the Treasury was not available.  

**Interest rate risk** – Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to changes in market interest rates. As of June 30, 2023, weighted average maturity of the investments contained in the Treasury is approximately 267 days.  

**Credit risk** – Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. This is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The Treasury investment pool does not have a rating provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  

**Custodial credit risk** – Custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, a government will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. The California Education Code and the District’s investment policy do not contain legal or policy requirements that would limit the exposure to custodial credit risk for deposits other than the following provision for deposits: the California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits that are made by state or local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral pool held by a depository regulated under state law (unless so waived by the governmental unit). The market value of the pledged securities in the collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total amounts deposited by the public agencies.

4. **INTERFUND TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER DISTRICT FUNDS**  

Transfers to and from other District Funds are operating transfers from a fund receiving revenue to a fund through which the resources are being expended. Transfers in from other District Funds were as follows for the year ended June 30, 2023:  

The District’s County State Schools Facilities Fund transferred $2,115,222 to the Measure N Building Fund as reimbursement of state matching funds from the Office of Public School Construction.  

5. **COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**  

The District is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of the ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Measure N Building Fund.  

As of June 30, 2023, the Measure N Building Fund has approximately $3 million in outstanding commitments on ongoing construction contracts.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

**Independent Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee and Board of Education**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Carmichael, California**

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the Measure N Building Fund of the San Juan Unified School District (the District), which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated April 15, 2024.

## Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements, on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified.

**Report on Compliance and Other Matters**

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Purpose of This Report**

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the organization’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

**Board of Education and Independent Citizens’ Bond**  
**Oversight Committee for Measure N**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Carmichael, California**

We have conducted a performance audit of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) Measure N General Obligation Bonds for the year ended June 30, 2023.

We conducted our performance audit in accordance with **Government Auditing Standards** issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for the findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Our audit was limited to the objectives listed on page 2 of this report which includes determining compliance with the performance requirements for the Proposition 39 and Measure N General Obligation Bonds under the applicable provisions of Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution and Proposition 39 as they apply to the bonds and the net proceeds thereof. Management is responsible for the District’s compliance with those requirements.

Solely to assist us in planning and performing our performance audit, we obtained an understanding of the internal controls of the District to determine if internal controls were adequate to help ensure the District’s compliance with the requirements of Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution. Accordingly, we do not express any assurance on the internal controls.

The results of our tests indicated that, in all significant respects, the San Juan Unified School District expended Measure N General Obligation Bond funds for the year ended June 30, 2023 only for the specific projects developed by the District’s Board of Trustees and approved by the voters, in accordance with the requirements of Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution.

## PERFORMANCE AUDIT  
### JUNE 30, 2023

The financial activity related to the Measure N General Obligation Bonds is recorded in sub-Fund 24 (Measure N Building Fund) of Fund 21 (Building Fund) in the District's audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023.

### PROCEDURES PERFORMED

We obtained the Measure N Building Fund detailed general ledger for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. We obtained the actual invoices and other supporting documentation for a sample of expenditures to ensure compliance with Proposition 39 and Measure N General Obligation Bond funding. We performed the following procedures:

- We verified the mathematical accuracy of the expenditures included in the Measure N Building Fund detailed general ledger for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.

- Solely to assist us in planning and performing our performance audit, we obtained an understanding of the internal controls of the District to determine if internal controls are adequate to help ensure the District’s compliance with the requirements of Proposition 39.

- We determined that the Independent Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee is fulfilling its duties as required by Education Code 15278 and as outlined in their Committee Bylaws.

- We selected a sample of 18 expenditures in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The sample was selected to provide a representation across construction projects, vendors, and expenditure amounts. For each selection, we performed the following procedures:
  1. Reviewed supporting documentation to ensure that funds were properly expended on the specific projects outlined on the publicized list and met the requirements for bidding, if applicable.
  2. Verified the expenditure was for construction, rehabilitation, or replacement of school facilities, including furnishing and equipping of District facilities, deferred maintenance upgrades or the acquisition or lease of real property facilities and verified that funding was not used for salaries of school administrators or other operating expenditures of the District.

The District incurred total expenditures of $4,933,900 through June 30, 2023, for the Measure N projects listed in the following Schedule of Activities.

and Board of Education  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**

**Opinion**  
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Measure P Building Fund of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, as listed in the table of contents.  

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Measure P Building Fund of the District as of June 30, 2023, and the respective changes in financial position for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

**Basis for Opinion**  
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  

**Emphasis of Matter**  
As discussed in Note 1, the financial statements present only the Measure P Building Fund and do not purport to and do not present fairly the financial position of the District as of June 30, 2023, or the changes in its financial position for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.  

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**  
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

**Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards**

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated April 15, 2024, on our consideration of the District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

### NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### JUNE 30, 2023  

1. **ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF ACTIVITIES**  

The San Juan Unified School District (the District) was established in 1960 and serves a 75-square mile area covering the communities of Arden-Arcade, Carmichael, Citrus Heights, Fair Oaks, Gold River, and Orangevale. The District currently operates 65 schools and provides early learning, kindergarten through 12th grade, and adult program education to approximately 40,000 students.  

These financial statements present only the Measure P General Obligation Bonds Building Fund, which is recorded in sub-Fund 26 (Measure P Building Fund) of Fund 21 (Building Fund) in the District's audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023. These financial statements do not include financial data for the remainder of the District’s funds and component unit, which accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require to be presented with the financial statements of the District.  

On November 8, 2016, the electorate of the San Juan Unified School District approved the $750 million Measure P general obligation bonds with greater than 55% of the votes in favor.  

- On March 7, 2017, the District issued General Obligation Bonds Election of 2016 (Series 2017 Bonds) in the amount of $39,920,000 to finance specific construction, acquisition, and modernization projects. These bonds matured during succeeding years through August 2019, and were issued at interest rates ranging from 2.00% to 2.50%.  

- On January 22, 2019, the District issued General Obligation Bonds of Election 2016 (Series 2019 Bonds) in the amount of $80,000,000 to finance specific construction, acquisition, and modernization projects. These bonds mature during succeeding years through August 2029 and were issued at 4.00% interest rate.  

- On October 29, 2020, the District issued General Obligation Bonds, Election 2016, Series 2020 in the amount of $150,000,000. The bonds range in maturity date with final payoff on August 1, 2041 and interest rates ranging from 0.25% - 4.00%.  

- On April 21, 2022, the District issued General Obligation Bonds, Election 2016, Series 2022 in the amount of $150,000,000. The bonds range in maturity date with final payoff of August 1, 2046 and interest rates ranging from 2.18% to 5.00%.  

As of June 30, 2023, total outstanding debt related to Measure P is $301,110,000.  

The Board of Supervisors of Sacramento County is empowered and obligated to annually levy ad valorem taxes, without limitation as to rate or amount, upon all property subject to taxation within the District (except for certain property which is taxable at limited rates), for payment of interest and principal of the Bonds when due. The District has established separate debt service funds to account for the collection and remittance of bond principal and interest payments. Additional information on the bonds’ payment schedules can be found in the District’s financial statements.

## 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

**Basis of presentation** – The District accounts for its financial transactions in accordance with the policies and procedures of the California Department of Education's *California School Accounting Manual*. The accounting policies of the District conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).  

**Measurement focus and basis of accounting** – Measurement focus indicates the type of resources being measured, while the basis of accounting indicates the timing of transactions or events for recognition in the financial statements. The Measure P Building Fund is a governmental fund, and has been presented using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measurable and available, and are considered to be available when they are collectible within the current period or soon thereafter to pay liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the District considers revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. Expenditures are generally recorded when the related liability is incurred.  

**Cash and cash equivalents** – For the purpose of the financial statements, cash equivalents are defined as financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less.  

**Restricted cash and cash equivalents** – Cash that is externally restricted to purchase or construct capital or other assets is classified as a restricted asset in the balance sheet.  

**Restricted fund balance** – Restricted fund balance includes resources which are legally or contractually restricted by external third parties. Fund balance is restricted for capital projects of the Measure P Building Fund in accordance with the project list for the 2016 General Obligation Bonds.  

**Estimates used in financial reporting** – In preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenditures during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

## 3. RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  

Cash and equivalents as of June 30, 2023, consist of the following:  

- Cash and equivalents with County Treasury  $ 6,802,655  
- Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent  $ 103,715,605  
- **Total cash and equivalents**  $ 110,518,260  
<!-- Page 125 -->
# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## MEASURE P BUILDING FUND  
### NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### JUNE 30, 2023  

**Cash and equivalents in County Treasury** – The Measure P Building Fund maintains cash in the Sacramento County Treasury (the Treasury). The Treasury pools funds with those of other districts in the county and invests the cash. The share of each fund in the pooled cash account is separately accounted for and interest earned is apportioned quarterly based on the relationship of a fund’s daily balance to the total of pooled cash and investments.

Participants’ equity in the Treasury investment pool is determined by the dollar amount of the participant deposits, adjusted for withdrawals and distributed income.

The Treasury is authorized to deposit cash and invest excess funds by California Government Code Section 53648 et seq. and is restricted by Government Code Section 53635, pursuant to Section 53601.

**Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent** – Cash and equivalents with fiscal agent are held by the Treasury and represent bond proceeds restricted for capital projects.

**Derivative investments** – The Measure P Building Fund did not directly enter into any derivative investments. Information regarding the amount invested in derivatives by the Treasury was not available.

**Interest rate risk** – Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value to changes in market interest rates. As of June 30, 2023, weighted average maturity of the investments contained in the Treasury is approximately 267 days.

**Credit risk** – Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. This is measured by the assignment of a rating by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The Treasury investment pool does not have a rating provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.

**Custodial credit risk** – Custodial credit risk for deposits is the risk that, in the event of the failure of a depository financial institution, a government will not be able to recover its deposits or will not be able to recover collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. The California Education Code and the District’s investment policy do not contain legal or policy requirements that would limit the exposure to custodial credit risk for deposits other than the following provision for deposits: the California Government Code requires that a financial institution secure deposits that are made by state or local governmental units by pledging securities in an undivided collateral pool held by a depository regulated under state law (unless so waived by the governmental unit). The market value of the pledged securities in the collateral pool must equal at least 110% of the total amounts deposited by the public agencies.

### 4. INTERFUND TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER DISTRICT FUNDS  

Transfers to and from other District Funds are operating transfers from a fund receiving revenue to a fund through which the resources are being expended. Transfers in from other District Funds were as follows for the year ended June 30, 2023:

The District’s General Fund transferred $5,000,000 to the Measure P Building Fund for Arcade Fundamental Middle School Construction project.

#### JUNE 30, 2023  

The District’s County State Schools Facilities Fund transferred $3,781,931 to the Measure P Building Fund as reimbursement of state matching funds from the Office of Public School Construction.

5. **COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**  
The District is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of the ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Measure P Building Fund.

As of June 30, 2023, the Measure P Building Fund has approximately $172.6 million in outstanding commitments and construction contracts.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

**Independent Bond Citizens’ Oversight Committee and Board of Education San Juan Unified School District Carmichael, California**

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the Measure P Building Fund of the San Juan Unified School District (the District), which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated April 15, 2024.

## Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the District’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements, on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified.

**Report on Compliance and Other Matters**

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Purpose of This Report**

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the organization’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the District’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

**Board of Education and Independent Citizens’ Bond**  
**Oversight Committee for Measure P**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Carmichael, California**

We have conducted a performance audit of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) Measure P General Obligation Bonds for the year ended June 30, 2023.

We conducted our performance audit in accordance with Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our conclusion based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for the findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Our audit was limited to the objectives listed on page 2 of this report which includes determining compliance with the performance requirements for the Proposition 39 and Measure P General Obligation Bonds under the applicable provisions of Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution and Proposition 39 as they apply to the bonds and the net proceeds thereof. Management is responsible for the District’s compliance with those requirements.

Solely to assist us in planning and performing our performance audit, we obtained an understanding of the internal controls of the District to determine if internal controls were adequate to help ensure the District’s compliance with the requirements of Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution. Accordingly, we do not express any assurance on the internal controls.

The results of our tests indicated that, in all significant respects, the San Juan Unified School District expended Measure P General Obligation Bond funds for the year ended June 30, 2023 only for the specific projects developed by the District’s Board of Trustees and approved by the voters, in accordance with the requirements of Proposition 39, as specified by Section 1(b)(3)(C) of Article XIII A of the California Constitution.

**PROCEDURES PERFORMED**

- Solely to assist us in planning and performing our performance audit, we obtained an understanding of the internal controls of the District to determine if internal controls are adequate to help ensure the District’s compliance with the requirements of Proposition 39.

- We determined that the Independent Citizens’ Bond Oversight Committee is fulfilling its duties as required by Education Code 15278 and as outlined in their Committee Bylaws.

- We selected a sample of 47 expenditures in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The sample was selected to provide a representation across construction projects, vendors and expenditures. For each selection, we performed the following procedures:

**CONCLUSION**

Based upon the procedures performed, we found that, for the items tested, the San Juan Unified School District has properly accounted for the expenditures of the Measure P General Obligation Bonds. Further, it was noted that the funds were not used for salaries of school administrators or other operating expenditures. Our audit does not provide a legal determination on the District’s compliance with specific requirements.

**MANAGEMENT COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

None.

**Communications With Those Charged With Governance**

We have audited the financial statements of the Measure J, N, and P Building Funds of the San Juan Unified School District (the District) information for the year ended June 30, 2023. Professional standards require that we provide you with information related to our audit. We are providing the District’s Bond Oversight Committee (BOC) and the Board of Education (Board) with information regarding the scope and results of the audit to assist the BOC and the Board in overseeing management’s financial reporting and disclosure process. This information is intended solely for the use of the BOC, Board, and management of the District and is not intended to be, and should not be, used by anyone other than these specified parties. The following pages summarize these required communications.

![Management and Auditor Responsibilities](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Management+and+Auditor+Responsibilities)

**MANAGEMENT AND AUDITOR RESPONSIBILITIES**

**Auditors’ Responsibilities under Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.**

The financial statements are the responsibility of management. As stated in our engagement contract, our responsibility is to express opinions about whether the financial statements prepared by management with your oversight are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our audit of the financial statements does not relieve you or management of your responsibilities.

As part of our audit, we considered the internal control of the District. Such considerations were solely for the purpose of determining our audit procedures and not to provide any assurance concerning such internal control.

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the District’s financial statements are free of material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit.

We issued unmodified opinions on the financial statements of the Measure J, N, and P Building Funds for the year ended June 30, 2023.

The financial statements of the Measure J, N, and P Building Funds of the District present only the Measure J, N, and P Building Funds and do not purport to, and do not present fairly the financial position of the District as of June 30, 2023, or the changes in its financial position for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our opinions were not modified with respect to this matter.

# QUALITATIVE ASPECTS OF ACCOUNTING PRACTICES

## Significant Accounting Policies

Management is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies. In accordance with the terms of our engagement contract, we advised management about the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application.

The significant accounting policies used by the Measure J, N, and P Building Funds of the District are described in Note 2 to the financial statements.  
We noted no transactions entered into by the Measure J, N, and P Building Funds of the District during the year for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus. There are no significant transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements in a different period than when the transaction occurred.

## Management Judgments and Accounting Estimates

Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based on management’s knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ significantly from those expected.

Certain financial statement disclosures are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statement users.

We noted no estimates or disclosures that we consider particularly sensitive.

# INTERACTIONS WITH MANAGEMENT

**Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit**  
We performed the audit according to the planned scope and timing previously communicated in our engagement contract.

**Management Consultations with Other Independent Accountants**  
In some cases, management may decide to consult with other accountants about auditing and accounting matters, similar to obtaining a “second opinion” on certain situations. If a consultation involves application of an accounting principle to the District’s financial statements or a determination of the type of auditor’s opinion that may be expressed on those statements, our professional standards require the consulting accountant to check with us to determine that the consultant has all the relevant facts.  
To our knowledge, there were no such consultations with other accountants.

**Disagreements with Management**  
For purposes of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as a financial accounting, reporting, or auditing matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, that could be significant to the financial statements or the auditor’s report.  
We are pleased to report that no such disagreements arose during the course of our audit.

**Management Representations**  
We requested certain representations from management in a letter to us.

**Difficulties Encountered in Performing the Audit**  
We encountered no significant difficulties in dealing with management in performing and completing our audit. Management and staff were well prepared and very cooperative.

![Other Matters](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Other+Matters)

| **OTHER MATTERS** |  |
|-------------------|--|
| **Other Audit Findings or Issues** | We generally discuss a variety of matters, including the application of accounting principles and auditing standards, with management each year prior to retention as the District’s auditors. However, these discussions occurred in the normal course of our professional relationship and our responses were not a condition to our retention. |
| **Significant Risks Identified by the Auditor** | In order to design appropriate audit procedures in accordance with GAAS, the engagement team is required to perform a risk assessment during its audit planning process. The following significant risks of material misstatement presumed by the auditing standards were incorporated into our audit plan: <ul><li>Properly approved project expenditures</li><li>Management override of controls.</li></ul> |
| **Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements** | Professional standards require us to accumulate all known and likely misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that are trivial, and communicate them to the appropriate level of management. No significant adjustments were identified during our audit. |

**FIRST AMENDMENT TO SITE LEASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN STC FIVE LLC AND SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT**

THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO SITE LEASE AGREEMENT (the “First Amendment”) is made effective this ___ day of ____, 2024 (“Effective Date”), by and between SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (hereinafter referred to as “Lessor”) and STC FIVE LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, by and through its Attorney In Fact, Global Signal Acquisitions II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (hereinafter referred to as “Lessee”).

**RECITALS**

WHEREAS, Lessor and Sprint Spectrum, L.P. (“Original Lessee”) entered into a Site Lease Agreement dated February 13, 2001 (the “Agreement”) whereby Original Lessee leased certain real property, together with access and utility easements, located in Sacramento County, California from Lessor (the “Site”), all located within certain real property owned by Lessor (“Lessor’s Property”); and

WHEREAS, STC LLC is currently the Lessee under the Agreement as successor in interest to the Original Lessee; and

WHEREAS, the Site may be used for the purpose of constructing, maintaining and operating a communications facility, including tower structures, equipment shelters, cabinets, meter boards, utilities, antennas, equipment, any related improvements and structures and uses incidental thereto; and

WHEREAS, the Agreement had an initial term that commenced on July 31, 2001 and expired on July 30, 2006. The Agreement provides for six (6) extensions of three (3) years each, all six (6) of which were exercised by Lessee, followed by one (1) extension of two years (each extension is referred to as a “Renewal Term”). According to the Agreement, the final extension expires on July 30, 2026; and

WHEREAS, Lessor and Lessee desire to amend the Agreement on the terms and conditions contained herein.

NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, Lessor and Lessee agree as follows:

1. **Recitals: Defined Terms.** The parties acknowledge the accuracy of the foregoing recitals. Any capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement. All references in the Agreement to the capitalized term “District” shall be replaced with “Lessor”.

2. **Additional Renewal Terms.** At the conclusion of the seventh Renewal Term (July 30, 2026), Lessee shall be entitled to five (5) additional extensions of five (5) years each, with the final lease extension expiring on July 30, 2051 (each additional extension is referred to as an “Additional Renewal Term”). The Initial Term, Renewal Terms, and Additional Renewal Terms shall be collectively referred to as the “Lease Term”. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, the Lease Term shall automatically be extended for each successive Additional.
<!-- Page 146 -->
![Attachment A](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+A)

**Renewal Term** unless Lessee notifies Lessor of its intention not to renew at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then current term.

3. **Consent to Sublease and Modification.** In accordance with Section H.2. of the Agreement, Lessor hereby acknowledges and agrees to the sublease of a portion of the Site, as expanded, to Dish Network Corporation or an affiliate or subsidiary (the “Dish Subtenant”) for purposes of installation, maintenance and replacement of equipment, antennas, cables, fiber, and related accessories on the Site for the operation of a wireless communications facility thereon (“Dish Sublease”). As used herein, the term “sublease” includes any arrangement by which a third party can collocate its equipment at the Site, whether it is by sublease, license, easement or any other agreement or arrangement. To the extent required by the Agreement, Lessor hereby further consents to the installation, maintenance, and operation of such improvements reasonably required by the Dish Subtenant to operate at the Site.

4. **First Additional Lease Area.** The existing Site is hereby expanded in size to include additional space, which consists of a three hundred thirty-one (331) square foot parcel of real property adjacent to the existing Site at a location more particularly described hereto and shown on the Site Plan attached hereto as Exhibit A-1 attached hereto and described on Exhibit A-2 attached hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this First Amendment, Lessee is not relinquishing any rights to any lease area, access easements, and/or utility easements that it possesses prior to the date of this First Amendment. In the event the location of any of Lessee’s or its sublessees’ existing improvements, utilities, and/or access routes are not depicted or described on the Site Plan and/or legal description, Lessee’s leasehold rights and access and utility easement rights over such areas shall remain in full force and effect and the Site shall be deemed to include such areas.

5. **First Additional Rent.** In consideration of the lease of the First Additional Lease Area, Lessee shall pay to Lessor a monthly fee equal to the greater of: (i) fifty percent (50%) of the rental, license or similar payments due to the Lessee from such Dish Subtenant (excluding any reimbursement of taxes, construction costs, installation costs, or revenue share reimbursement) (the “Additional Percentage Fee”), or (ii) One Thousand Five Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($1,500.00) per month (the “Additional Fixed Fee”). Lessor shall only be entitled to the greater of either the Additional Percentage Fee or the Additional Fixed Fee for the Dish Subtenant, but not both. The amount payable pursuant to the foregoing, whether the Additional Percentage Fee or Additional Fixed Fee, shall be referred to as the “First Additional Rent”. The First Additional Rent shall be due and payable commencing on the earlier of (i) receipt of rent payments from the Dish Subtenant, or (ii) the commencement of installation of improvements within the First Additional Lease Area. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessor may elect to receive the lesser of either the Additional Percentage Fee or the Additional Fixed Fee during the next Additional Renewal Term by delivering written notice of its election to Lessee at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then current term. If Lessor fails to notify Lessee of its election prior to the aforementioned ninety-day deadline, then Lessee shall continue to pay the greater of the Additional Percentage Fee or the Additional Fixed Fee as set forth above. Lessee shall have sole discretion as to whether, and on what terms, to sublease, license or otherwise allow occupancy of the Site to the Dish Subtenant, however no such additional sublease, license or other occupancy shall be permitted without the prior written consent of the Lessor as set forth in Section H.2. of the Agreement. There shall be no express or implied obligation for Lessee to sublease, license or otherwise allow occupancy of the
<!-- Page 147 -->
![Attachment A](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+A)

Site. Lessee shall pay to Lessor the First Additional Rent until the earlier of (i) the expiration of the term of Lease; or (ii) the expiration or termination of the Dish Sublease.

6. Business Summary Report. Once per calendar year, Lessor may submit a written request to Lessee for a business summary report pertaining to Lessee’s First Additional Rent obligations for the prior twelve (12) month period, and Lessee shall provide such written report to Lessor within sixty (60) days after Lessee’s receipt of such written request. Lessor shall send such written request to the Notice address set forth in this First Amendment.

7. Right to Return the First Additional Lease Area. Lessee shall have the option, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Lessor, in its sole and absolute discretion, to return the First Additional Lease Area to the Lessor and to terminate the lease of the same by removing all improvements from the First Additional Lease Area and returning same to its condition as of the Effective Date, ordinary wear and tear excepted (the “Return of the First Additional Lease Area”). Effective upon removal of all improvements from the First Additional Lease Area, the First Additional Rent shall cease and will no longer be due or payable.

8. Reimbursement of Lessor’s Costs. Lessee shall reimburse all of Lessor’s costs, for review and approval by the Division of State Architect and the services of an Inspector of Record (as may be required) arising from or related to the Dish Sublease. Such reimbursement shall occur within sixty (60) days of Lessee’s receipt of documentation from Lessor detailing the costs for such reimbursement as set forth in this Section 7. The Lessee shall also reimburse the Lessor for costs incurred for construction management services related to this First Amendment, in an amount not to exceed Two Thousand Five Hundred and 00/100 Dollars ($2,500.00).

9. Rent. For the avoidance of doubt, in addition to the First Additional Rent, the rent payable by Lessee as of the Effective Date is Two Thousand Four Hundred Seventy-Five and 74/100 Dollars ($2,475.74) per month. Such rent shall remain payable and shall continue to increase in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 2 of the Agreement.

10. Conditional Signing Bonus. As consideration, Lessee will pay to Lessor a one-time amount of Twenty Five Thousand and 00/100 Dollars ($25,000.00) for the full execution of this First Amendment, payable within sixty (60) days of the full execution of this First Amendment (“Conditional Signing Bonus”). In the event that this First Amendment (and any applicable memorandum of Agreement and/or amendment) is not fully executed by both Lessor and Lessee for any reason, Lessee shall have no obligation to pay the Conditional Signing Bonus to Lessor.

11. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Lessor. Lessor represents, warrants and covenants to Lessee as follows:

a) Lessor is duly authorized to and has the full power and authority to enter into this First Amendment and to perform all of Lessor’s obligations under the Agreement as amended hereby.

b) Lessee is not currently in default under the Agreement, and to Lessor’s knowledge, no event or condition has occurred or presently exists which, with notice or the passage of time or both, would constitute a default by Lessee under the Agreement.
<!-- Page 148 -->
c) Lessor agrees to provide such further assurances as may be requested to carry out and evidence the full intent of the parties under the Agreement as amended hereby, and ensure Lessee’s continuous and uninterrupted use, possession and quiet enjoyment of the Site under the Agreement as amended hereby.

d) Lessor acknowledges that the Site, as defined, shall include any portion of Lessor’s Property on which communications facilities or other Lessee improvements exist on the date of this First Amendment.

12. Notices. Lessee’s notice address as stated in Section L.1. of the Agreement is amended as follows:

If to Lessee:  
STC Five LLC  
c/o Crown Castle USA Inc.  
Attn: Legal - Real Estate Department  
2000 Corporate Drive  
Canonsburg, PA 15317  

13. IRS Form W-9. Lessor agrees to provide Lessee with a completed IRS Form W-9, or its equivalent, upon execution of this First Amendment and at such other times as may be reasonably requested by Lessee. In the event the Lessor’s Property is transferred, the succeeding Lessor shall have a duty at the time of such transfer to provide Lessee with a completed IRS Form W-9, or its equivalent, and other related paper work to effect a transfer in the rent to the new Lessor. Lessor’s failure to provide the IRS Form W-9 within thirty (30) days after Lessee’s request shall be considered a default and Lessee may take any reasonable action necessary to comply with IRS regulations including, but not limited to, withholding applicable taxes from rent payments.

14. Counterparts. This First Amendment may be executed in separate and multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

15. Remainder of Agreement Unaffected. In all other respects, the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any portion of the Agreement that is inconsistent with this First Amendment is hereby amended to be consistent.

16. Recordation. Lessee, at its cost and expense, shall have the right to record a memorandum of this First Amendment in the official records of Sacramento County, California at any time following the execution of this First Amendment by all parties hereto. In addition, Lessee shall have the right in its discretion, to record a notice of lease, affidavit or other form to be determined by Lessee without Lessor’s signature in form and content substantially similar to the memorandum, to provide record notice of the terms of this First Amendment.

# ARTICLE 13. DEFAULT AND TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

A. A-E Default: A-E shall be in default if A-E at any time refuses or neglects to prosecute its work in a timely fashion or in accordance with the Project schedule; or is adjudicated as bankrupt; or commits any act of insolvency; or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors without Owner’s consent; or fails to make prompt payment to persons furnishing labor, equipment, or materials; or fails in any respect to properly and diligently prosecute its work; or becomes delinquent with respect to contributions or payments required to be made to any employee benefit programs or trust; or otherwise fails to perform fully any and all of the agreements herein contained.

B. Cure: If A-E fails to cure the default within seven (7) days after written notice thereof, Owner may, at its sole option, take possession of any documents, files (including electronic files), and other materials prepared or used by A-E in connection with the Project(s); provide any such work, labor, or materials to another design professional as may be necessary to overcome the default; and deduct the cost thereof from any money then due or thereafter to become due to A-E under a Service Order issued under this Agreement.

C. Default Termination: In the event Owner elects to terminate a Service Order or this Agreement due to A-E default, Owner shall have the right to immediate possession of all plans, specifications, and other work in progress prepared by A-E, whether located at the Project, at A-E’s place of business, or at the offices of a subconsultant, and may employ any other person or persons to finish the Basic Services and provide the materials therefor. In case of such default termination, A-E shall not be entitled to receive any further payment under a Service Order issued under this Agreement until the Project is completely finished. At that time, if the unpaid balance of the amount to be paid under the Service Order exceeds the expenses incurred by Owner in finishing the Project, such excess shall be paid by Owner to A-E, but, if such expenses shall exceed such unpaid balance, then A-E shall promptly pay to Owner the amount by which such expenses exceed such unpaid balance. The expenses referred to in the last sentence shall include expenses incurred by Owner in causing the services called for under the Service Order to be provided by others, for attorneys’ fees, and for any damages sustained by Owner by reason of A-E’s default or defective work, plus a markup of ten percent (10%) on any and all such expenses.

D. Owner Default: A-E may terminate a Service Order issued under this Agreement for cause upon seven (7) days’ written notice to Owner for any of the following reasons: (1) Owner fails to timely pay undisputed sums due to A-E; (2) Owner assigns this Agreement or Service Order or transfers ownership of the Project prior to completion of A-E’s services under the Service Order if the assignment or transfer is made without the prior written consent of A-E; or (3) Owner suspends the Project or A-E’s services for more than 180 consecutive days. Owner shall have the right to cure.

the stated ground for termination within the seven (7) day notice period, which may include identifying grounds on which any unpaid amounts are disputed and/or properly withheld and/or otherwise are not yet due to Architect. In the event of cure, A-E's notice shall become null and of no further force or effect.

E. Termination for Convenience. In addition to the foregoing right to terminate for default, Owner reserves the absolute right to terminate this Agreement and/or any Service Order issued hereunder without cause, for any reason whatsoever, upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to A-E. In the event of such termination without cause, Owner shall have the right to immediate possession of all plans, specifications, and other work in progress prepared by A-E, whether located at the Project, at A-E’s place of business, or at the offices of a subconsultant, and may employ any other person or persons to finish the design work and provide the materials therefor. Also in the event of such a termination without cause, A-E shall be entitled to payment in an amount not to exceed the contract price which shall be calculated as follows: (1) Payment for any phase of the work then satisfactorily completed and accepted by Owner, according to the percentages set forth in Article 12 (if applicable); plus (2) Reimbursable Costs actually incurred by A-E in connection with performance according to Article 11; plus (3) a portion of the percentage applicable to a phase which is in progress, which bears the same ratio to the total amount to be earned for that phase as the work then completed in that phase bears to the total work to be accomplished in that phase, plus (4) reasonable termination expenses. There shall be deducted from such sums as provided in this section the amount of any payment made to A-E prior to the date of termination of this Agreement or Service Order issued hereunder. A-E shall not be entitled to any claim or lien against Owner or the Project for any additional compensation or damages in the event of such termination and payment. In addition, Owner’s right to withhold funds under Article 12.F shall be applicable in the event of a termination for convenience.

F. Saving Clause: If this Agreement or any Service Order hereunder is terminated by Owner for default and it is later determined that the default termination was wrongful, such termination automatically shall be converted to and treated as a termination for convenience under this Article and A-E shall be entitled to receive only the amounts payable hereunder in the event of a termination for convenience.

G. Survival of Obligations: No termination of this Agreement or any Service Order hereunder shall excuse or otherwise relieve A-E of its responsibilities under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the standard of care for its work and services, with respect to any work and/or services performed prior to the date of termination and any work that survives the termination. All of A-E’s responsibilities under this Agreement with respect to work and/or services performed prior to the date of termination shall survive any termination.

ARTICLE 14. PERFORMANCE TIME SCHEDULE

A. Upon receipt of a Service Order, A-E shall prepare and submit for Owner approval a schedule for the performance of A-E’s services. This schedule shall include

![Attachment A](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+A)

reasonable allowances for review and approval times required of Owner, performance of services by Owner’s consultants, and review and approval times required by public authorities having jurisdiction over the Project. This schedule shall be equitably adjusted as the Project progresses, allowing for changes in scope, character, or size of the Project requested by Owner, or for delays or other causes beyond A-E’s reasonable control.

B. A-E shall respond to the following specific items within the time frames indicated below:

1. Requests for Information: 3 days

2. Change order requests: 7 days

3. Submittals 14 days

C. In the event A-E fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement and/or under the Service Order within the times specified in the approved schedule for its work and thereby delays the Project, Owner may withhold payments until all work within the particular phase at issue is completed or the schedule for A-E’s work has been recovered. This remedy shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, Owner’s other rights and remedies relating to A-E’s default, whether under this Agreement or applicable law.

ARTICLE 15. RECORDS OF THE ARCHITECT-ENGINEER; AUDIT

A. Records of A-E’s direct personnel and reimbursable expenses pertaining to any Extra Services on a Project and records of accounts between Owner and Contractor shall be kept on a generally recognized accounting basis and shall be available to Owner or its authorized representative at mutually convenient times.

Owner or the Owner’s authorized representative shall have access, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours, to any plans, specifications, books, documents, accounting records, papers, project correspondence, project files, and other records of A-E and/or its subconsultants directly or indirectly related to a Project. Such access shall include the right to examine and audit such records and make excerpts, transcriptions, and photocopies at Owner’s expense.

C. A-E shall maintain all records in connection with any Service Order for at least four (4) years following completion of the work under the Service Order, or any longer time as may be required by law.

single limit of not less than $1,000,000. Said policy shall be on a primary and non-contributory basis.

D. **Excess Liability.** A-E shall have in place an Umbrella or Excess Liability Policy in the amount of $1,000,000.

F. Subconsultant’s Insurance. With the exception of Professional Liability (E&O) policy limits, A-E shall require each and every subconsultant to maintain insurance coverages commensurate with that which is required of the A-E in this Article 16 and shall incorporate these insurance requirements into each subconsultant agreement. This includes, but is not limited to, the Additional Insured and Waiver of Subrogation provisions.

In addition, on Projects that are not covered by a primary project-specific Professional Liability Insurance policy, subconsultants that have any element of design responsibility must carry Professional Liability Insurance in the amount of at least $2,000,000 per claim. Where a primary project-specific policy is required or provided, subconsultants are not required to maintain Professional Liability insurance in connection with the Project. The Owner may approve a variation in foregoing insurance requirements, upon a determination that coverage, scope, limits and/or forms of such insurance are either not commercially available or that Owner’s interests are otherwise fully protected.

A-E shall not allow any subconsultant to commence work on its subcontract until the subconsultant has provided A-E with Certificates of Insurance and applicable endorsements as well as the signed statement acknowledging compliance with Section 3700 of the Labor Code, as required in Paragraph A of this Article 16. It is the responsibility of A-E to ensure that all subconsultants comply with this provision, and to provide the information when requested by Owner.

If requested by Owner, A-E shall deliver certificates of insurance or copies of the insurance policies and endorsements of all subconsultants; provided, however, that this authority shall not relieve A-E of its obligation to ascertain the existence of such insurance.

ARTICLE 17. REPRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

A. A-E shall provide, at no expense to Owner, copies of the following: (a) for Projects other than Design-Build, preliminary plans and construction documents for the review and approval of Owner at end of schematic design, design development, Construction Document, DSA submittal, and completed and quality-controlled sets for constructability review or (b) for Design-Build, the preliminary and final Performance Criteria documents. Owner’s requirement is one (1) reproducible master for each item plus three (3) print sets; state agency requirements to be determined and provided by A-E, including any electronic media in a format acceptable to the agencies.

B. For Projects other than Design-Build, A-E shall provide one (1) reproducible master and one (1) electronic master in AutoCAD (most current version) compatible format for drawings, and one (1) copy in the most current version of Microsoft Word of the final approved Contract Documents for bidding and construction purposes.

C. For Design-Build Projects, A-E shall provide one (1) copy in the most current version of Microsoft Word of the final approved Performance Criteria.

ARTICLE 18. RECORD DOCUMENTS (PROJECTS OTHER THAN DESIGN-BUILD ONLY)

A. At completion of each Project (or any portion that is constructed as a distinct unit), A-E shall prepare Record Documents and furnish to the Owner one (1) Electronic Copy set of record drawings, one (1) set of electronically marked-up specifications and media showing materials and methods of construction as actually accomplished. The Record Documents shall be prepared by revision of the original drawings using Contractor’s and Project Inspector’s marked-up record set and any project documents (including but not limited to, Addenda, DSA CCD’s, Field Clarifications, Requests for Information, Architect Supplemental Instructions, Construction Change Directives/Contingency Draw Authorizations, and other similar documents) necessary to reflect all changes in the Record Documents and specifications as incorporated into the Project. A-E shall return to Owner the Contractor’s and Project Inspector’s original marked-up record set (if hard copy used, provide the hard copy along with a scanned copy of same documents) along with the following deliverables:

1. Electronic copy (.pdf) of entire bid set (specifications and drawings, as applicable), including any addenda issued. The electronic copy shall be transmitted electronically to Owner’s archives department, though the CM, if any, and shall be sent with a return receipt requested. If A-E does not receive a return receipt or other confirmation of receipt from within two (2) business days of sending the copy, A-E shall follow up to confirm that the files were received.

2. Electronic copy (.pdf) of contractor as-built drawings (“Protection Set”). Prior to scanning, the drawings shall be approved, signed, and dated by the Project Inspector. Drawings shall be scanned in color.

   a) The Protection Set shall have proper revision clouds indicating areas that were revised and the source of each revision, e.g., RFI #, AB #, etc.

   b) In coordination with the Owner and the CM, verify that all approved project documents (e.g., RFIs, ABs, ASIs, CCD, etc.) are scanned and that each of these documents is consolidated into the appropriate, clearly-marked sub-folder and forwarded to CM, if any, and to Owner’s archives department.

   c) Files transmitted electronically shall be sent either by e-mail with a return receipt requested or personally delivered to the CM, if any, and to the Owner’s archives department.

h) Complete Specification book(s) with all revised pages inserted.

ARTICLE 19. OWNERSHIP OF DOCUMENTS AND RE-USE OF DOCUMENTS

A. Owner acknowledges that the A-E Performance Criteria (for Design-Build) or construction documents (other than Design-Build), including electronic files, are instruments of professional service. Nonetheless, the plans, specifications, estimates, programs, reports, models, and other material prepared by or on behalf of A-E under this Agreement and any Service Order issued hereunder (collectively the “Documents”) shall be and remain the property of Owner, pursuant to Section 17316 of the Education Code, whether the Project is completed or not. All Documents shall be delivered to Owner on the earlier of (1) sixty (60) days after Owner’s Notice of Completion of the Project, or (2) the date of termination of this Agreement or Service Order for any reason prior to final completion of the Project. The Documents may be reproduced and/or used by Owner and its agents, employees, representatives, and assigns, in whole or in part, or in modified form, for all purposes Owner may deem advisable in connection with completion and maintenance of, and additions, modifications to, or modernizations of the Project, without further employment of or payment of any compensation to A-E;

San Juan Unified School District A-E Agreement 2024  
Page 30 of 36
<!-- Page 190 -->
![Attachment A](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+A)

provided, however, that if this Agreement or Service Order is terminated for any reason prior to completion of the Project and if under such circumstances Owner uses, or engages the services of and directs another A-E to use, the Documents to complete the Project, Owner agrees to release A-E from any responsibility for the conformance of the incomplete portions of the Project to the Documents and to hold A-E harmless from any and all liability, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements), relative to claims arising out of matters and/or events which occur subsequent to the termination of this Agreement or Service Order as a result of causes other than the fault or negligence of A-E, or anyone for whose acts it is responsible.

B. Except as otherwise permitted in this Agreement or any Service Order issued hereunder, Owner shall not assign, delegate, sublicense, pledge or otherwise transfer the right to use and re-use the Documents to any other party without the prior written authorization of A-E. However, in addition to the rights to use and re-use the Documents as set forth in this Article 19, Owner shall be permitted to authorize design-builders, lease-leaseback providers, Contractors or any construction subcontractors, equipment suppliers or material suppliers to use and reproduce, to the fullest extent necessary, applicable portions of the Documents appropriate to and for use in their work.

C. In the event Owner ever desires to construct all or part of another wholly unrelated project which would be essentially identical in design to the Project that is the subject of a Service Order, A-E agrees to permit re-use of design and the corresponding contract documents, subject to payment to A-E of a fair and reasonable re-use fee.

D. Any unauthorized re-use of the Documents shall be at Owner’s sole risk and without liability to A-E. Owner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless A-E and its subconsultants against any damages, liabilities, or costs, including reasonable legal fees and disbursements, arising from the unauthorized re-use or modification of the Documents. Submission or distribution of the Documents to meet official regulatory requirements or for similar purposes does not constitute an unauthorized re-use of the Documents.

E. A-E shall not re-use the Documents without the prior written consent of Owner. Any unauthorized re-use of the Documents by A-E shall be at A-E’s sole risk and without liability to Owner. A-E agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Owner against any damages, liabilities or costs, including reasonable legal fees and disbursements arising from the unauthorized re-use of the Documents.

ARTICLE 20. NOTICE OF CLAIMS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

A. A/E shall give written notice of any claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Service Order issued hereunder within three (3) business days of the event(s) giving rise to the claim. Said written notice shall specify the nature, amount and basis of the claim and shall be certified under penalty of perjury and in compliance with the California False Claims Act, as set forth below. Failure to include these

San Juan Unified School District A-E Agreement 2024  
Page 31 of 36
<!-- Page 191 -->
![Attachment A](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+A)

required certifications shall constitute grounds for rejection of the claim. Failure to provide notice of the claim within the time limit set forth herein shall constitute grounds for rejection of the claim.

B. Direct Negotiation will be the initial process utilized by the parties after issuance of written notice of any claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Service Order as specified immediately above. Either the Owner or A-E may make a request for Direct Negotiations as an initial attempt to resolve any claim, dispute, or other matter arising out of this Agreement or Service Order. Direct Negotiation representatives of the parties shall be the Owner’s designated representative and the A-E’s designated representative. Any requested Direct Negotiation will take place at the Project or at a mutually agreeable location specified by the parties’ designated representatives, and the Direct Negotiations shall take place as soon as reasonably practical after the request for Direct Negotiation. The parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the claim, dispute, or other matter arising out of the Agreement. Each party shall document the results of the Direct Negotiation and these documents shall be exchanged between the parties.

C. Mediation. The parties agree that all claims, disputes or controversies between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Service Order, or breach thereof, initially shall be submitted to non-binding mediation before a mediator mutually agreed upon by the parties. In the event the parties are unable to agree on a mediator within fifteen days from the date either party submits a written request to mediate a claim, dispute, or controversy, the mediator shall be selected and the mediation administered under the Construction Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The costs and fees of the mediator shall be paid equally by the parties. The parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to reach an agreement with respect to the claim, dispute, or controversy. Neither party shall commence or pursue arbitration or litigation until the completion of mediation proceedings.

D. Venue. Any arbitration or any judicial proceeding shall be brought and heard in Sacramento County.

E. It is expressly agreed that no mediation or arbitration shall be initiated prior to the completion of the Project or termination of this Agreement or the Service Order, whichever is earlier.

F. Claim certification: A-E acknowledges that it has read and is familiar with the provisions of the California False Claims Act (California Government Code sections 12650 et seq.). Submission by A-E of a claim (as the term “claim” is defined in the False Claims Act) to Owner in connection with a Project, whether on its behalf or on behalf of a subcontractant, shall constitute a representation by A-E to Owner that submission of the claim does not in any respect violate the California False Claims Act. Any party with an interest in the claim, including any subcontractant(s), shall certify under penalty of perjury the validity and accuracy of any claim submitted to Owner, as provided below. Compliance with this claim certification requirement is a condition.

precedent to any obligation Owner might otherwise have to review the claim, and failure to provide such certification shall constitute a waiver of the claim. The claim certification required by this paragraph shall provide as follows:

**CLAIM CERTIFICATION**

Under penalty of perjury, and with specific reference to the California False Claims Act, Government Code sections 12650, et seq., I certify that submission of the attached claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data prepared by the undersigned company is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that submission of the claim to Owner does not violate the California False Claims Act; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of claimant.

**ARTICLE 21. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS**

This Agreement and all Service Orders issued hereunder shall be binding upon Owner and its successors and upon A-E, its partners, successors, executors, and administrators. Neither this Agreement, nor any Service Order, nor any monies due to become due thereunder, may be assigned by A-E without the consent and approval of Owner.

In particular, A-E acknowledges that this Agreement was awarded based on a competitive process in which A-E's Key Personnel, experience, expertise, competence, and other aspects of its business were considered in selecting A-E to receive an award. As a result, if A-E's business materially changes, such as by a significant increase or decrease in size, by being acquired by or merging with another entity, by loss of Key Personnel, by change in local or primary office location, or otherwise, the Owner will evaluate whether to continue this Agreement with the changed A-E entity. The Owner may require A-E to submit documentation of its experience and expertise in connection with such review. The decision whether to continue this Agreement with A-E will be made in Owner's sole and absolute discretion.

**ARTICLE 22. INDEMNITY**

A. A-E shall, with respect to all work which is covered by or incidental to this Agreement or Service Order issued hereunder, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Owner, its officers, directors and employees (collectively “Owner”), from and against any and all liens and claims asserted by firms or individuals claiming through A-E, and
<!-- Page 193 -->
![Attachment A](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+A)

claims, liability, loss, damage, costs, or expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert’s fees, awards, fines, or judgments, relating to the death or bodily injury to persons, injury to property, design defects, or other loss, damage, or expense to the extent that any of the above that arise out of, pertain to, or relate to the negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct of A-E. A-E’s duty shall include the duty to defend the indemnitees as required by Civil Code section 2782.8. However, A-E shall not be obligated under this Agreement or any Service Order to indemnify Owner to the extent that the damage is caused by the active or sole negligence or willful misconduct of Owner or its agent or servants other than A-E.

B. A-E shall indemnify, defend, and hold Owner harmless against any claim, suit, or action, or any alleged violation or infringement of patent rights, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights which may be made against Owner by reason of the use in connection with or as a part of the Project anything which is now or may hereafter be covered by patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, and also against all expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert witness’ fees, which Owner may incur in defending or adjusting any such claim, suit, or action.

C. In no event shall A-E’s cost to defend exceed A-E’s proportionate percentage of fault. However, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the event one or more defendants is unable to pay its share of defense costs due to bankruptcy or dissolution of the business, A-E shall meet and confer with the other parties regarding the unpaid defense costs.

D. Owner shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless A-E, its officers, directors, employees and subconsultants (collectively “A-E”) from and against any and all claims, liability, loss, damage, costs, or expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert’s fees, awards, fines or judgments, to the extent caused by Owner’s negligent acts, errors or omissions in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or any Service Order issued hereunder. Owner’s duty shall include the duty to defend the indemnitees as required by Civil Code section 2782.8. However, Owner shall not be obligated under this Agreement or any Service Order to indemnify A-E to the extent that the damage is caused by the negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct of A-E or its agents or servants other than Owner.

E. A-E and Owner each agree to promptly serve notice on the other party of any claims arising hereunder, and shall cooperate in the defense of any such claims.

F. The acceptance by Owner or its representatives of any certificate of insurance providing for coverage of any kind shall in no event be deemed a waiver of any of the provisions of this Article 22. None of the foregoing provisions shall deprive Owner or A-E of any action, right or remedy otherwise available by law.

ARTICLE 23. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

San Juan Unified School District A-E Agreement 2024  
Page 34 of 36

<!-- Page 194 -->
A. The furnishing of available as-built drawings of existing structures is the responsibility of Owner.

B. Environmental Impact Reports and/or similar studies are not included in this Agreement and, if required, will be specified in the Service Order and paid for by Owner.

C. By executing this Agreement, A-E confirms the representation made in its proposal that it is not subject to Russian Sanctions. In addition, with each Service Order, A-E will be required to sign the Certification Regarding Russian Sanctions in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit I, as that form may be revised by the time the Service Order is issued.

ARTICLE 24. FINGERPRINTING

Education Code Section 45125.1 shall apply to this Agreement unless expressly excluded by any Service Order. The Owner’s administrator initiating and/or responsible for this Agreement shall, pursuant to section 45125.1 and Owner policy and guidelines, determine whether fingerprinting is required of A-E and/or its employees prior to issuing any Service Order. Once such determination is made, the administrator shall verify his/her determination on the signature page of the Service Order. If the Administrator concludes fingerprinting is required, the following shall apply:

A. The A-E shall, prior to commencement of work pursuant to the Service Order, require any person affiliated with A-E (or, in appropriate cases, him or herself) to be fingerprinted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) if that person will have unsupervised access to school campuses. Upon verification from DOJ that those persons fingerprinted have no record of a serious or violent felony, A-E will so certify by signing and submitting the A-E Certification attached as Exhibit F and incorporated by reference. In addition, A-E shall submit the names of those persons who have received clearance and are authorized to have unsupervised access to school campuses on a form as indicated in Exhibit G. Any person whose name is not on the cleared list may not have such access. In that case, A-E must make arrangements with Owner for appropriate access. No person with a violent or serious felony as reported by DOJ may have access to the school campuses.

B. Failure to comply with this provision, or permitting unsupervised access by an employee whose name has not been cleared by DOJ as certified by A-E, shall constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement.

### ACTION REQUESTED:
The superintendent is recommending that the board discuss the proposed strategic plan developed through extensive input and feedback from students, families, staff and community members.

**Action anticipated:** 05/28/2024

---

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:
As shared with the board in February, last fall the district engaged in a strategic planning process by collecting input and feedback from the variety of educational partners that represent interests in our educational system including students, families, community members staff and others.

The voice collected was used by a representative group of approximately 60 individuals, known as the Core Planning Team, to identify four strategic directions that the district should focus its efforts on if we are to ensure our students are prepared and hopeful for their future. A group of approximately 25 comprised of primarily district leaders and students then considered the voice collected and worked to ensure the language suggested by the Core Team was achievable and could be aligned. The work of both teams yielded a draft strategic framework, published in March, that was then taken back to students, families and community members for feedback.

Based on the feedback collected on the draft strategic framework, the Core Planning and Design teams made revisions to the strategic framework. Those revisions were reviewed by the superintendent and the strategic planning facilitation team to produce the proposed strategic plan being presented with this item.

The proposed strategic plan maintains four focused strategic directions: 1) Advance student success; 2) Prioritize Equitable Practices; 3) Enhance Employee Support Systems; and 4) Invest in Efforts to Assist Students and Families to Empower Themselves. Each strategic direction identifies a purpose statement to help bring clarity to its intended meaning and priority outcomes that identify what we will see in San Juan Unified should our efforts in these areas be successful.

Additionally, the district’s current mission and beliefs were reviewed and updated with feedback from both the Core Planning and Design teams to reflect where San Juan Unified stands today and to incorporate a vision of what we hope to achieve in the future. These proposed changes again reflect the varied and vital voice collected through the intensive engagement process.

The proposed strategic plan identifies the framework from which district efforts will be guided for the next three to five years. Should the board adopt the strategic plan, the next step will be for staff to operationalize the plan by developing specific action plans aligned to the strategic directions and their identified priority outcomes for the next school year. This work will begin in the summer and lead into the fall with feedback from our students, staff, families and community.

# Strategic Planning  
## Community Engagement Report  
### San Juan Unified School District  
#### January 22, 2024  
prepared by CESO Communications  
<!-- Page 278 -->
# Attachment E

## 01 | Background

In the Fall of 2023, CESO Communications (CESO) contracted with San Juan Unified School District (San Juan Unified) to facilitate a strategic planning process to guide the work of the district over the next five years.

Following initial conversations with the district, as well as a review of the district’s previous strategic work, community surveys and additional district data, CESO conducted a comprehensive community engagement process that included students, staff, parents and community members in November and December 2023.

The goal of this initial phase of the strategic planning process was to provide a variety of engagement activities that allowed individuals from across community member groups to share their input. A combination of in-person and virtual engagements was used to solicit insight from community members, which allowed participants to share their thoughts at times and in ways that were most convenient for them. There was also an effort to intentionally include student voices in the process to create a strategic plan that represents the true mission and vision of the school system.

Insights from these engagements have been included in this report. This report, along with other district reports, strategic initiatives and data will inform the work of the Core Planning Team and Design Team when they meet in January and February to develop a draft strategic plan.

## 02 | Engagement Process & Activities

In November and December 2023, the district held several in-person and virtual engagements that included personal interviews; focus groups and collaborative workshops with current students, staff, parents/families, alumni and community members; and open input opportunities for students and families. An online conversation was also available for all members of the San Juan Unified community to weigh in with their thoughts and insights via ThoughtExchange.

To keep participants focused on the future and not current topics or concerns, the district set out to answer the following key question:

**What do San Juan Unified students need to be PREPARED for their next step and HOPEFUL for their future?**
<!-- Page 279 -->
![Engagement Formats & Participation](https://www.example.com/image-url)

Engagement Formats & Participation
San Juan students, families, staff and community members were invited to participate in a variety of engagements. In-person sessions included focus groups, open insight opportunities, and consensus workshops. Interviews were conducted with school board members, the superintendent and identified community leaders. Virtual conversations included using the district's ThoughtExchange platform, surveys and Zoom-based focus groups.

*An analysis of the insights from all engagements is included later in this report as part of the key themes and findings.*

**Focus Groups**  
Several in-person and virtual focus groups were held to gather feedback from staff, parents, and community members. In each session, participants were asked to provide their insights about the current reality for students in San Juan Unified, suggestions for improvement, and ideas for further supporting district students and families.

**Consensus Workshops**  
San Juan students, families, staff and community members were invited to participate in facilitated engagements. Each in-person session was structured as a facilitated consensus workshop, providing opportunity for participants to provide their insights through individual brainstorming as well as small and large group discussions.

*An analysis of the ideas from the consensus workshops is incorporated into the key themes later in this report, with the raw data included in the appendix.*

**Student Session**  
The student consensus workshop involved 85 high school students representing all the high schools in the district. Conversations focused on two workshop questions: what do students need to feel prepared and hopeful for their future, and what do students need to feel a sense of belonging in their school.

![Open Insight Sessions](https://example.com/image4.jpg)

**Open Community Session**  
Two open community consensus workshops were held for all staff, families and community members. Conversations focused on two questions: what do students need to feel prepared and hopeful for their future, and what do parents/families need to feel welcomed, valued and motivated to be involved in their student’s education.

**Open Insight Sessions**  
The district offered several open insight sessions, including pop-up engagements at K-8 sites to get student insights on hopes and dreams as well as suggestions for improvement. In addition, the district posted banners at schools for parents/families to offer their insights.
<!-- Page 281 -->
![Attachment E](https://example.com/image.png)

**Interviews**  
CESO Communications also conducted personal interviews with each member of the San Juan Unified School Board and the Superintendent. Interview questions were similar to those asked in other focus groups, with an additional focus on leadership of the district, their hopes for the strategic planning process, and their visions for the future.

In addition, the district identified community leaders for personal interviews. Again, the interviews focused on what the district should focus on in the future to better support students and families, with an additional focus on community and civic partnerships.

**Surveys**  
The district also included surveys for identified audiences to ensure wide representation in the engagement phase. Students in middle school and high school were administered a survey in November 2023. Questions were similar to those of the focus groups, seeking insight on how prepared students feel for life after graduation, what skills they feel they need for adulthood, and ideas about what teachers and staff can do to help them feel more prepared and valued in the district.

In total, 438 students participated, 98% of whom took the survey in English, and a small percentage in Russian. Responses were nearly evenly distributed among grade levels:
- Grade 6 - 10%
- Grade 7 - 15%
- Grade 8 - 15%
- Grade 9 - 18%
- Grade 10 - 17%
- Grades 11 - 14%
- Grade 12 - 11%

The district also surveyed community partners. Again, questions focused on what skills students need for adulthood and how the district can support students and families.

**ThoughtExchange**  
In addition to the engagements outlined above, all members of the San Juan Unified School District community were invited to participate in an online conversation via the district’s ThoughtExchange platform. The conversation was combined with data gathering for the district's annual LCAP process, focusing on what the district is doing well and what it can do better to support students and families. The exchange was open for participation for six weeks in October and November 2023, and garnered significant input, with more than 600 participants providing nearly 577 thoughts. The majority (94%) of participants in the exchange did so in English. Additional responses were captured in Spanish (2%), Russian (2%) and Persian (1%).

*An analysis of the ideas shared in the ThoughtExchange is incorporated into the key themes later in this report, with a more detailed analysis included in the appendix.*

**PROCESS**  
The digital engagement platform ThoughtExchange was used to facilitate the online engagement of San Juan Unified students, staff, parents, and community members by providing a virtual environment in which they were able to respond to some brief survey questions and a general prompt question. Participants were also able to rate and respond to the comments of other respondents.

ThoughtExchange operates as both a survey on some baseline questions and an online conversation in which participants generate ideas and feedback and build a sense of consensus on topics. Participation is not only about posting responses but also about sharing reactions, feelings, and suggestions about the comments and responses of others.

**TIMELINE & COMMUNICATION**  
The platform was open from October 5 - November 18, 2023. The district shared messaging about the exchange through various channels to invite and encourage participation.

**EXCHANGE QUESTION**  
As for the virtual conversation, participants were asked to engage with the following prompt question:  
*What are some things our schools are doing well to support students and families, and what are some things our schools should do differently to improve support for students and families?*

**PARTICIPATION**  
Of those who participated in the virtual discussion, engagement was strong. The online platform garnered significant input, with over 600 participants providing nearly 600 thoughts.

- **Participants**: 608  
  Last activity: 30+ days ago  
- **Thoughts**: 577  
  0.9 thoughts / participant  
- **Ratings**: 15,629  
  25.7 ratings / participant  

**Participation Demographics**  
While participants could choose more than one affiliation with the district, the exchange included mostly parents/guardians (80%), followed by district staff (17%). A small number of participants identified as community members (2%) and a handful identified as current students. The majority (54%) of parent respondents said they had children at the elementary level, with approximately one-quarter noting association with middle school (26%) or high school (28%).

The racial/ethnic demographics show 61% of respondents identifying as white, 15% as Hispanic or Latino/a/x, 9% noting two or more races, and 5% as African American or Black. Approximately 15% of respondents opted not to identify their race/ethnicity.

Additionally, respondents were asked to identify their relationship with special populations, with 5% noting they had a student with disabilities, 2% each as English learners and/or socioeconomically disadvantaged, and 1% each as homeless and/or foster youth.

**Level of Engagement**  
The exchange also indicated a strong level of engagement, with a ratings ratio of 27. The ratings ratio measures engagement in the exchange topic. A ratings ratio of 15 or higher shows strong engagement.

**ADDITIONAL EXCHANGE**  
An additional ThoughtExchange was conducted with after-school staff, allowing their insights to be included in the research phase of the planning process. Twenty-two staff participated in the exchange, and 25 thoughts were submitted. The majority (71%) of participants identified as Bridges staff, whereas 29% identified with Discovery Club. The vast majority (95%) of participants have worked in the district for more than five years, with the other 5% identifying a district tenure of one to three years.

*An analysis of the ideas shared in the After School Program Staff ThoughtExchange is incorporated into the key themes later in this report, with a more detailed analysis included in the appendix.*

It should also be noted that in every group, participants held conversations about the changing demographics of the district, with special attention paid to newcomer families.

# San Juan Unified School District
## Strategic Planning Engagement Report (Round 2)
### April 15, 2024
prepared by CESO Communications
<!-- Page 300 -->
![Executive Summary](https://www.sanjuan.edu/cms/lib/CA01902727/Centricity/Domain/4/Attachment%20F%20Executive%20Summary.pdf)

**Executive Summary**

**Background**  
In the fall of 2023, San Juan Unified School District (San Juan Unified) launched a strategic planning initiative by inviting all members of the district community to provide insights for the future of the district. A variety of engagements were conducted, including focus groups, interviews, open sessions, community workshops and an online ThoughtExchange discussion, all centered around what the district should focus on in the next three to five years.

In late January to early February, a Core Planning Team, composed of over 65 students, staff, parents/families and community members came together to review engagement insights and a variety of other district data to begin to develop a draft strategic direction for San Juan Unified. The team met over two days, culminating in the development of draft directions and priority outcomes that serve as a framework for a new strategic plan.

This framework was then reviewed by an internal team of district leaders, called the Design Team, who were charged with refining the language of the plan to ensure that outcomes are kept at a high level rather than being too specific or predetermining specific actions and solutions.

In an effort to ensure the new strategic plan is truly developed in partnership with the entire San Juan Unified community, students, families, staff and residents were asked to share their feedback on the draft strategic framework. Insights were collected via focus groups, online surveys, student pop-up sessions, community gallery walks and another ThoughtExchange. The findings from these engagements informed the work of the Core Planning Team and Design Team as they reconvened on April 17 and April 19, respectively, to revise the strategic framework.

**Strategic Direction I**  
Overall, feedback on Strategic Direction I was largely positive, with respondents appreciating the clarity and understandability of the language and purpose. The direction was celebrated for its alignment with the district's objectives and its emphasis on inclusion and addressing educational gaps. The success of adult education classes and programs like the Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) program were also highlighted as strengths.

However, challenges were identified, including limited progress in English Language (EL) support, weaknesses in the high school English Language Development (ELD) curriculum, and uncertainties surrounding the implementation of culturally responsive classrooms. Concerns were raised about potential conflicts between the district's vision of inclusion and Special Education (SpEd) provisions, as well as a lack of clarity and disclosure to SpEd parents regarding available options.
<!-- Page 301 -->
![Attachment F](https://example.com/image-url)

Despite these challenges, the majority of respondents expressed favorable views of Strategic Direction I. Specifically, 92% agreed that it helps sustain high academic achievement and 93% said it addresses current gaps in the San Juan Unified district. In addition, over 89% found the language and purpose of the direction clear and understandable, while a similar percentage understood how the priority outcomes would help meet identified goals. Suggestions for improvement included clarifying the purpose, strengthening community engagement, enhancing support for SpEd, prioritizing career technical pathways, and reordering and clarifying priorities within the strategic direction.

Additionally, there were calls to prioritize social and emotional support for students, expand capacity and bilingual staff, address behavioral issues, improve communication and clarity, and offer more professional development opportunities focused on the whole child approach and social-emotional learning (SEL).

In summary, while respondents largely appreciated the clarity and purpose of Strategic Direction I, there are areas for improvement to ensure that it effectively addresses the needs of all students and families within the district, particularly those in SpEd and English Language support programs.

## Strategic Direction II

Feedback on Strategic Direction II reflected mixed opinions among respondents. While many participants appreciated the strong and well-written language of the direction, some challenges and areas for improvement were identified.

Strengths of Strategic Direction II included positive reception and treatment of refugees and foster youth, fair chances and supports provided to students, and recognition of the need for increased knowledge among counselors. However, challenges were noted, such as the need for improved dissemination of information about available supports, concerns about the specificity of the commitment to race over other areas like SpEd, and uncertainty about the application of the direction to SpEd.

In the survey results, it was evident that there were varied opinions regarding the effectiveness of the direction in sustaining high academic achievement and addressing current gaps in San Juan Unified. Only 41% of respondents expressed agreement that the goals would sustain high academic achievement, and 35% agreed that it would address gaps, with the majority of respondents seeming less convinced. In regard to understanding the language and purpose of the direction, responses were again mixed. While some found it clear and understandable, nearly 79% felt there was room for improvement in clarity. Similarly, understanding how the priority outcomes would contribute to meeting identified goals also saw a range of perspectives among the respondents, with less than 30% indicating agreement with the statement.

Suggestions for improvement included clarifying language and purpose, addressing economic mobility and comprehensive support, prioritizing mental health and well-being, and explicitly addressing the needs of students in SpEd.

These included appreciation for collaborative efforts and support provided to staff, as well as recognition of the importance of supporting staff to meet the diverse needs of learners. However, challenges were also identified, such as uncertainty surrounding the term "destination district" and concerns about providing adequate support and compensation to staff amidst negotiations and union interactions.

Despite these challenges, the majority of participants viewed Strategic Direction III favorably. Specifically, approximately 90% agreed that it helps sustain high academic achievement and addresses current gaps in the San Juan Unified district. Moreover, over 92% found the language and purpose of the direction clear and understandable, while a similar percentage understood how the priority outcomes would meet identified goals.

Suggestions for improvement focused on enhancing clarity and academic focus within the strategic direction, highlighting the importance of administrative support for teachers, motivating participation in professional development, improving transparency and communication, and emphasizing employee safety and inclusivity. Additionally, students emphasized the importance of creating a supportive, respectful, and inclusive work environment for school employees, advocating for employee support and appreciation, a positive work environment, effective communication and collaboration, equitable treatment and support systems, and student involvement in supporting staff.

However, challenges were also identified, including discrepancies in the welcome and support received at secondary sites compared to other levels, the need for proactive early interventions and monitoring of meaningful engagement, and the lack of availability of before/after school care, particularly for families without transportation or schools without Transitional Kindergarten (TK) classes.

While favorability toward Strategic Direction IV was strong (88% agreement) in terms of its potential impact on academic achievement, it received less favorable ratings (less than 30% agreement) on other factors. Notably, suggestions for improvement focused on enhancing clarity and academic focus, expanding listening sessions and partnerships, refining direction and purpose statements, emphasizing student empowerment and inclusive communication, providing parent learning opportunities, and improving communication and engagement.

Respondents emphasized the importance of creating a supportive school environment where all members of the community feel valued and supported.

![What is a Land Acknowledgement and why does it matter?](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=What+is+a+Land+Acknowledge+and+why+does+it+matter%3F)

**What is a Land Acknowledgement and why does it matter?**

- In alignment with our 8 Point Commitment to Educational Justice, the practice of Land Acknowledgement represents a commitment to a culture of inclusion.

- It serves as public recognition and invitation to uplift the lives and stories of the Indigenous Peoples who have been displaced from their homelands due to colonialism and genocide.

- It is a powerful way of showing respect, honoring the truth, and a step toward correcting the practices that erase Indigenous People’s history and culture.

---

![Whose Land Are We On?](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Whose+Land+Are+We+On%3F)

**Whose Land Are We On?**

**Miwok**
- Miwok in the Sacramento region lived in villages alongside the rivers and streams of the Sierra Nevada from the Cosumnes River on the north to the Calaveras River on the south.

**Maidu**
- Maidu lived in a territory extending from the Sacramento River to the crest of the Sierra Nevada mountain and centering in the drainage of the Feather and American Rivers in California.

**Nisenan**
- Nisenan territory reached from the Sierra Nevada mountains on the east to the Sacramento River on the west. Most of the villages were along the rivers that run west out of the mountains: the Yuba River, the Bear River, the American River, and the lower part of the Feather River.
<!-- Page 334 -->
![Writing a Land Acknowledgement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Writing+a+Land+Acknowledgement)

**Writing a Land Acknowledgement**

**Considerations:**
- Be thoughtful.
- Be purposeful.
- Use present tense when referring to Native Peoples.
- Consult knowledgeable tribal people for input.
- Don’t steer away from trauma.
- Make a commitment to create meaningful change in the community.
- Foster inclusion with tribal community.
- Commit to lasting relationships with the Native American community.

---

![Land Acknowledgement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Land+Acknowledgement)

**Land Acknowledgement**

Acknowledgement by itself is a small gesture. It becomes meaningful when coupled with authentic relationships and informed action connected to:
- 8 Point Commitment to Educational Justice
- Native American student voice
- Cultural humility and sensitivity trainings
- Representation through partnerships
- Curriculum decisions
- Academic and social-emotional support
- American Indian Education Program
<!-- Page 335 -->
![Sacramento County Office of Education Land Acknowledgement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Sacramento+County+Office+of+Education+Land+Acknowledge+ment)

## Sacramento County Office of Education Land Acknowledgement
The history of the Sacramento area, and the people, is rich in heritage, culture and tradition. This area was, and still is, the Tribal land of the Nisenan people. Sacramento was a gathering place for many local tribes who have lived throughout the central valley and the foothills for generations and were the original stewards of this land.

We would like to acknowledge the Southern Maidu people to the North, the Valley and Plains Miwok/Me–Wuk Peoples to the south of the American River, and the Patwin Winton Peoples to the west of the Sacramento River. We would also like to honor the Wilton Rancheria, the only federally recognized tribe in Sacramento County.

---

## Recommendations
- Incorporate a land acknowledgement into San Juan Unified formal occasions and ceremonies, such as high school graduations and board meetings.
- Implement the practice of incorporating land acknowledgements and thereby show a meaningful commitment to systemic change for our tribal community.
- Acknowledge tribes’ enduring relationship with the land, while also recognizing the tragic history of genocide inflicted upon California Indigenous People.
<!-- Page 336 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

## Next Steps
- Collaboratively develop a land acknowledgement for school and district use that meets the considerations shared on slide 5.
- Utilize historical knowledge and perspectives of the American Indian Education Program Parent Advisory Committee and the Native Community.
- Seek guidance from local tribes and leaders in the community.
- Provide informational sessions and professional learning to build understanding and capacity of school and district staff related to the purpose and importance of land acknowledgement and inclusive practices.

Amounts transferred shall be repaid either in the same fiscal year or in the following fiscal year if the transfer takes place within the final 120 calendar days of a fiscal year. Borrowing shall occur only when the fund or account receiving the money will earn sufficient income, during the current fiscal year, to repay the amount transferred. No more than 85 percent of the maximum of moneys held in any fund or account during a current fiscal year may be transferred.  

This action would only be necessary should any fund have a temporary shortage of cash. Funds included:

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the San Juan Teachers Association tentative agreement with the San Juan Unified School District.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Statute requires that the public be made aware of the costs associated with a tentative collective bargaining agreement before it becomes binding on the district or county office of education. Government Code Section 3547.5 states:  

“Before a public school employer enters into a written agreement with an exclusive representative covering matters within the scope of representation, the major provisions of the agreement, including, but not limited to, the costs that would be incurred by the public school employer under the agreement for the current and subsequent fiscal years, shall be disclosed at a public meeting of the public school employer in a format established for this purpose by the Superintendent of Public Instruction [G.C. 3547.5(a)].”  

This tentative agreement was ratified by San Juan Teachers Association unit members with 98% approval.  

**ATTACHMENTS:**  
A: Tentative Agreement Between San Juan Unified School District (District) and the San Juan Teachers Association (Association) April 11, 2024  
B: Public Disclosure of Proposed Collective Bargaining Agreement (in accordance with AB1200)  

**PREVIOUS STAFF/BOARD ACTION:**

**FISCAL IMPACT:**  
Current Budget: $ 0  
Additional Budget: $ 30,354,663  
Funding Source: Unrestricted and Restricted  
Current Year Only ☐ On-going ☑  

**FINANCIAL DATA:**  
In accordance with AB 1200 (Chapter 1213/1991), GC 3547.5, and CCR, Title V, Section 15449, Fiscal Services has prepared an analysis of the fiscal impact of the proposed agreement and has submitted it to the Sacramento County Office of Education. Costs to the General Fund beginning each year for the San Juan Teachers Association tentative collective bargaining agreement are: an ongoing

increase of $21,976,491 in 2024-2025. An additional ongoing increase of $8,378,172 will take effect in 2025-2026.

**San Juan Unified School District (District)**  
**And the San Juan Teachers Association (Association)**  
**April 11, 2024**  

**Article 11. SALARY SCHEDULES**  
**11.01 Certificated Salary Schedules**  

The parties agree to adopt the new TK-12 salary schedules, effective July 1, 2024 (See Attachment A) and July 1, 2025 (See Attachment B). This salary schedule shall replace the current salary schedule located in Exhibit D1.

**11.01 (b)** The parties agree that the primary consideration in spring of 2022 is to explore MA/Doctorate Stipend options related to Exhibit D-9 credit.

For continuing Members employed as of July 1, 2021 the District shall provide a one-time off schedule payment equal to 3.5% of each member's base salary (Exhibits D1-D4 and F1) and stipends included in contract (Exhibit D9) as of July 1, 2021. This one-time off schedule payment will not increase a member's base compensation for the 2021-2022 school year.

The San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD) has an interest in working collaboratively with the San Juan Teacher's Association (SJTA) to create intent language and protocols to facilitate positive and productive conversations and processes on the concept of Total Compensation in the District. The goal is to create agreed upon norms and shared language related to Total Compensation.

**2023-2024 School Year:** It is the intent of the parties to provide a salary increase that keeps San Juan Unified School District competitive with surrounding districts.

- All base salary schedules (TK 12, ECE, and Adult Ed), shall be increased by a total of $X,XXX effective as of July 1, 2023/2024, effective as of July 1, 2022.  
- ECE: The parties agree that no reduction in staffing will occur as a result of the salary increase. Reductions may still occur based on enrollment decline.  
- The new salary schedule will be reflected in the members' pay no later than July 31, 2024 - November 30, 2022.  
- The retroactive check for the salary schedules shall be paid no later than June 30, 2024 - December 22, 2022.  
- There is no increase to stipend schedules D, C, D-7, D-8, and D-9 in 2022-2023-2024.  
- Stipend Schedules D11 (Hard to Staff) will be modified in accordance with the MOUs dated May 15, 2023 and April 5, 2024.  

**2024-2025 School Year:**  
The parties agree to reopen Article 11 for bargaining when one or any combination of the following conditions are met:
<!-- Page 354 -->
- If the enacted California 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level less than 0.5%, and no augmentation is provided to offset the loss of revenue, both parties agree to revisit the potential impact on the multiyear financial health of the district and examine potential cost saving measures.
- If the enacted California 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level in excess of 1.5%, or there is an augmentation to the COLA resulting in an increase of revenues beyond the 1.5%, the district and Association agree to examine potential enhancements to the salary schedule for Year 1 or Year 2.

### 2025-26 School Year
- If the enacted California 2025-26 State Budget COLA is funded at a level less than 1.73%, and no augmentation is provided to offset the loss of revenue, both parties agree to revisit the potential impact on the multiyear financial health of the district and examine potential cost saving measures.
- If the enacted California 2025-26 State Budget COLA is funded at a level in excess of 3.73%, or there is an augmentation to the COLA resulting in an increase of revenues beyond the 3.73%, the district and Association agree to examine potential enhancements to the salary schedule for Year 2.

### 11.02 Placement on salary schedule:

   - Teaching experience shall be granted on a year for year basis without a cap, up to 10 years of verified experience as noted in Exhibit D

The goal is to significantly increase the teacher salary schedule to be competitive with the education labor market and comparable professions. The goal is to increase the base, provide incentives and rewards for knowledge and skills, and reward for additional instructional responsibilities and leadership.

(i) Nurses: In the event of an RN vacancy or if a leave occurs, the District acknowledges the position is equivalent to 1.0 FTE.
- The Nurses leadership team currently advises assignments for all nurses based on a point system they have developed to equitably distribute the workload. The system is not exact and is based on a variety of factors and includes their professional judgment.
- As the Nurses leadership team analyzes the workload needs created by a vacancy or leave, the essential work will be identified as portions of an FTE.
- A member must voluntarily accept an assignment greater than 1.0 FTE.
- The leadership team determines how the assignment can be divided and what portion of an FTE each part is equal to (the total vacancy/leave may not exceed 1.0 FTE).
- The portion of FTE determined to cover the workload will be paid at either a 0.2 or 0.4 FTE as a "Greater than 1.0 FTE" stipend.
- A 0.2 FTE assignment will be paid the "Beyond Contract" Stipend amount per Exhibit D-6 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (as a pro rata share based on the number of days the service is provided).
- A 0.4 FTE will be a pro rata share of the "Beyond Contract" stipend amount multiplied by two (as a pro rata share based on the number of days the service is provided).
- The terms outlined above apply to any RN who accepts an extra assignment, including those who are less than 1.0 FTE.
- In the event an LVN (or equivalent position) vacancy or leave occurs, a nurse who provides coverage will be paid at pro rata per diem based on the amount of time the RN needs to provide to cover the essential work.
- When an RN, who has already accepted a "Greater than 1.0 FTE" stipend, is subsequently asked to provide support for an LVN vacancy/leave - and the new assignment impacts their ability to engage in the beyond FTE assignment originally agreed to - the practitioner will not receive less compensation than agreed upon previously.
- The additional assignment may be for up to one semester or one year, depending on the nature and anticipated duration of the opening, but may not exceed one year without offering other nurses the opportunity to contract for the additional assignment.

a. The "extended" absence or vacancy is defined as a time period exceeding two consecutive school weeks (not less than 15 working days)
b. Remaining counseling staff and site administration shall first evaluate a variety of solutions to mitigate potential workload impacts on existing counselor(s), with the understanding that:
   i. A plan to meet the needs of students previously served by the absent counselor/vacant position will be clearly articulated

<!-- Page 372 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

the work location and the member must be available by phone during the instructional day.

8.06 Split Site Staff (2 sites in one day)  
San Juan Unified offers a variety of supports and opportunities to students. Some assignments require practitioners to provide direct service to students at two sites within the same work day. Recognizing that split site staff assigned to work at two sites within one day may create complexity to the structure of the workday for affected individuals, When that is the case, the following shall apply:

8.06.1 When possible, split site staff should work with both site administrators (and as applicable the program supervisor), to determine the best schedule to meet student need while adhering to the following:  
a. Travel time between sites is built into the daily schedule:  
   i. practitioner would be provided no less than 45 minutes for travel time  
b. Lunches and Prep Periods, as contractually required, are built into the daily schedule  
c. Start and end times:  
   i. If there is no difference in each school’s start and end time, the practitioner would start and end their day according to the schools’ schedule.  
   ii. If there is a difference in start and end times, the practitioner would collaborate with site administration and/or the program supervisor to create a schedule that both considers student needs, but also creates a workday that is in alignment with the length of day experienced by their colleagues.  
   Example: Practitioner is assigned to schools A and B. School A starts at 8:00AM and ends at 2:30PM and school B starts at 8:45AM and ends at 2:45PM.  
   
20
<!-- Page 373 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
practitioner would work with each site to determine which days they start at school A at 8:00 and leave school B at 2:30 and which days they start at School A at 8:45 and leave school B at 2:45.  
Itinerant staff working with 3 or more sites create their own schedules and this contract language does not apply.  
Special Education Support Joint Committee  
The District and SJTA agree to change the Special Education Support Committee. The purpose of the joint committee is to explore interests and opportunities related to supporting our Special Education teachers.

A. Proposed Change in Compensation (Continued)

8. What was the negotiated percentage change? For example, if the change in "Year 1" was for less than a full year, what is the annualized percentage of that change for "Year 1"?  
6.98% equivalent ongoing salary increase across the three-year projections, except for adult education which received a 5% ongoing salary increase.

9. Were any additional steps, columns, or ranges added to the salary schedules? (If yes, please explain.)  
No

10. Please include comments and explanations as necessary. (If more room is necessary, please attach an additional sheet.)  

11. Does this bargaining unit have a negotiated cap for Health and Welfare benefits?  
Yes ☐ No ☒  
If yes, describe the cap amount.  

B. Proposed negotiated changes in noncompensation items (i.e., class size adjustments, staff development days, teacher prep time, classified staffing ratios, etc.)  
Unit negotiated an estimated 31.25 FTE to support class size reduction at six school sites with an unduplicated percentage higher than 78%. Also, an additional 28.0 FTE to support new staffing ratios for special education classrooms.

C. What are the specific impacts (positive or negative) on instructional and support programs to accommodate the settlement? Include the impact of changes such as staff reductions or increases, program reductions or increases, elimination or expansion of other services or programs (i.e., counselors, librarians, custodial staff, etc.)  
Unit negotiated additional 2.0 FTE Nurses.

D. What contingency language is included in the proposed agreement (e.g., reopeners, etc.)?  
If the 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level less than 0.5%, and no augmentation is provided to offset the loss of revenue, both parties agree to revisit the potential impact on the multiyear financial health of the district and examine potential cost saving measures. If the enacted California 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level in excess of 1.5%, or there is an augmentation to the COLA resulting in an increase of revenues beyond the 1.5%, the district and Association agree to examine potential enhancements to the salary schedule for Year 1 or Year 2.

E. Identify other major provisions that do not directly affect the district's costs, such as binding arbitrations, grievance procedures, etc.  
If an immediate supervisor needs additional time to hold a hearing on a grievance, and asks for an extension by the sixth day, a reasonable and mutually agreed upon extension will be granted.

F. Source of Funding for Proposed Agreement:  
1. Current Year  
Fund balance, restricted and unrestricted funds.

2. If this is a single year agreement, how will the ongoing cost of the proposed agreement be funded in subsequent years?  
N/A

3. If this is a multiyear agreement, what is the source of funding, including assumptions used, to fund these obligations in subsequent years? (Remember to include compounding effects in meeting obligations.)  
The district has a robust and healthy ending fund balance. Restricted and unrestricted funds will cover the cost of the agreement across all three years. The district expects to deficit spend from its ending fund balance to cover the cost of the settlement. The deficit spending is manageable even beyond the three year projections. The district will monitor its deficit spending in future years and make adjustments as needed to maintain a healthy ending fund balance.
