**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
In March 2020, San Juan Unified and other districts throughout the state moved to distance learning models in an effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. In July, the district presented a range of instructional models to be implemented as health conditions changed; this included implementing a hybrid in-person learning model when it was safe to return.  

Based on state guidance, the district entered into an agreement with employee groups to offer the option for all grade levels to return to in-person learning once the county is in the red tier of the state’s COVID-19 risk assessment system and stays there for two weeks. Subsequently, on January 14, 2021 the California Department of Public Health released guidance on the return to in-person learning.

### ACTION REQUESTED:
The superintendent is recommending that the Board of Education grant the Gateway International School (GIS) charter renewal petition for a term of five years starting July 1, 2021 through June 30, 2026. The term for this charter will expire on June 30, 2021, unless approved for renewal by the Board of Education.

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:
Gateway International Charter School has operated in San Juan as an independent charter for the past seven years. Gateway International Charter School serves students in grades TK-8.

Education Code section 47607, subdivision (b) states that “[r]enewals and material revisions of charters are governed by the standards and criteria described in 47605, and shall include, but not be limited to, a reasonably comprehensive description of any new requirement of charter schools enacted into law after the charter was originally granted or last renewed.” The Board of Education may deny a renewal petition if the charter school fails to meet the standard for renewal outlined within the Criteria for Renewal Education Code section 47605.

The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and Gateway International School has provided all necessary information, additions and/or changes as requested during the review process.

A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreement will continue to define the specific financial and operational relationship between Gateway International School and the district and resolve other matters of mutual interest not otherwise contained within the terms of each charter petition. It is the intent of the MOU that Gateway International School not be a fiscal burden to the district.

A copy of the charter petition is available for review in the Board of Education office.

![FINDINGS OF FACT AND RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING CHARTER PETITION RENEWAL FOR GATEWAY INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL](attachment_a.png)

**FEBRUARY 8, 2021**

**INTRODUCTION**

On November 30, 2020 Gateway International School (“GIS”) submitted a charter school renewal petition to the San Juan Unified School District (“district”). This renewal petition was submitted for a five year term starting July 1, 2021 and continuing through June 30, 2026. GIS is an independent charter school authorized by the District since 2013. GIS serves students in grades TK-8.

The Board of Education held a public hearing on January 12, 2021 to hear from the petitioners and consider the level of support for the petition. The district charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and GIS has provided all necessary information, additions and/or changes requested during the review process. Under new state law Assembly Bill (AB) 1505, resulting in Education Code section 47605(b), district staff recommendations, including the recommended findings, will be published 15 days prior to the public hearing at which the Board of Education will take action to either grant or deny the charter renewal petition.

**APPLICABLE LAW**

Education Code section 47607, subdivision (b) states that “[r]enewals and material revisions of charters are governed by the standards and criteria described in 47605, and shall include, but not be limited to, a reasonably comprehensive description of any new requirement of charter schools enacted into law after the charter was originally granted or last renewed.” The Board of Education may deny a renewal petition if the charter school fails to meet the standard for renewal outlined within the Criteria for Renewal Education Code section 47605. A renewal petition shall not be denied unless the district makes written factual findings that support one or more of the following findings:

(1) The charter school presents an unsound educational program for students during the term of its charter. (Education Code section 47605(c)(1).)

(2) The charter school is demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. (Education Code section 47605(c)(2).)

(3) The petition does not contain the necessary affirmations set forth in the Charter Schools Act. (Education Code section 47605(c)(4).)
<!-- Page 38 -->
(4) The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the 15 required elements set forth in the Charter Schools Act. (Education Code 47605(c)(5).)

(5) The petition does not contain a declaration of whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the exclusive public employer of the employees of the charter school for purposes of Chapter 10.7 (commencing with section 3540) of Division 4 of Title 1 of the Government Code.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For a charter school’s renewal petition to be approved, it must present a sound educational program for its students, based on the past performance of the charter school. Under new state law (AB1505) Education Code 47607, a charter authorizer must consider the charter school’s performance on indicators included in the California School Dashboard when evaluating a renewal petition. This new renewal process creates three tiers of renewal:

   a. High Performing Charter Schools  
   b. Middle Performing Charter Schools  
   c. Low Performing Charter Schools  

A school’s identification as belonging to one of the above tiers is determined by the California Department of Education (“CDE”) based on Dashboard data. The CDE publishes the list of charter schools and their renewal tiers.

Gateway International School falls in the Middle Performing tier. Schools in the Middle Performing tier may be renewed for a term of five years. (Education Code 47607.2(b).)

When evaluating charter schools that are in this tier, authorizers shall consider schoolwide performance and performance of all subgroups on the Dashboard, and shall provide “greater weight” to performance on measurements of academic performance in determining whether to grant a charter renewal. The authorizer shall also consider clear and convincing evidence, demonstrated by verified data, showing either the school achieved measurable increases in academic achievement, as defined by at least one year’s progress for each year in school, or strong postsecondary outcomes equal to similar peers. In addition, authorizers shall consider “verified data” for renewal of charter schools. According to Education Code section 47607.2(c), “verified data” is defined as “data derived from nationally-recognized, valid, peer-reviewed and reliable sources that are externally produced,” including postsecondary outcomes.
<!-- Page 39 -->
On June 29, 2020, Governor Newsom signed the 2020 Budget Act and accompanying budget-implementing legislation, including Senate Bill (SB) 98 (Chapter 24, Statutes of 2020), the Education Omnibus Trailer Bill. Included in this bill is the following: “The new renewal standards in Education Code sections 47607 and 47607.2 that depend on Dashboard indicators and state-average performance levels for the two consecutive years immediately preceding renewal have been modified for renewals that would depend on such results for 2019-2020 since there will be no results for that year. In those cases, the renewal standards are now keyed to the results in two of the three years immediately preceding renewal.”

After analyzing the Dashboard data, the review team found the following results in overall performance level and significant subgroup performance level. (In the renewal petition, charter element “Measurable Student Outcomes,” GIS provides a comparison to San Juan Unified School District and similar schools within San Juan Unified School District). GIS made measurable increases in academic achievement in both English Language Arts (ELA) and Math during the previous two years 2017-2018 and 2018-2019. These increases also occurred with all significant subgroups.

Education Code section 47604.32 identifies the oversight duties of a charter authorizer, including a visit to each charter school at least annually and ensuring that each charter school under its authority complies with all reports required of charter schools by law. In carrying out the oversight duties, the charter authorizer representatives will continue to monitor academic performance through the annual report (informational report due in May of each year - Education Code section 47604.33) and the LCAP and any other reports required by CDE (i.e. Learning Continuity Plan, etc.) in order to verify that the charter school is taking meaningful steps to improve academic performance.

During the week of September 28, 2020 thru October 2, 2020, a district representative conducted virtual classroom visitations at GIS. These visitations, conducted across grade levels, verified the implementation of the educational program outlined in the renewal petition. The representative observed standards-based lessons in all classrooms, as well as cohesive practices and strategies that support the International Baccalaureate (IB) Programme. On October 29, 2020, a district representative visited GIS Principal Joi Tikoi and Gateway Community Charters Deputy Superintendent Jason Sample at the school site. During this visit, staff discussed the implementation of a hybrid model of return to in-person learning and the supports provided to practitioners and students. In addition, the representative toured the school and observed classes in progress, the safety measures put in place for students in class and during recesses and the recent facility updates done in collaboration with SJUSD.

The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and has determined that GIS presents a sound educational program as evidenced by student academic performance and therefore meets this requirement for renewal.

2. For a charter school’s renewal petition to be approved, it must provide evidence that it has the capacity to implement the program set forth in the petition. This includes (but is not limited to) a sound financial and administrative plan, a description of facilities (including location(s) and current and projected availability), etc.

The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and has determined that GIS has provided the necessary evidence in the petition to meet this requirement for renewal.

3. For a charter school’s renewal petition to be approved, it must include the necessary affirmations set forth in the Charter Schools Act. (Education Code section 47605(c)(4).)

The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and has determined that GIS has provided the necessary affirmations in the petition to meet this requirement for renewal.

4. For a charter school’s renewal petition to be approved, it must contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the 15 required elements set forth in the Charter Schools Act. (Education Code section 47605(c)(5).)

The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and has determined that GIS has included reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the 15 required elements set forth in the Charter Schools Act.

5. For a charter school’s renewal petition to be approved, it must contain a declaration of whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the exclusive public employer of the employees of the charter school for purposes of Chapter 10.7 (commencing with Section 3540) of Division 4 of Title 1 of the Government Code.

The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and has determined that GIS has included the appropriate declaration.

**CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION**

Accordingly, based on the above findings, the district’s charter review team recommends to the superintendent that the renewal petition for Gateway International School be granted for a term of five years, commencing on July 1, 2021 and continuing through June 30, 2026.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**AGENDA ITEM:** I-4  
**MEETING DATE:** 02/23/2021  

**SUBJECT:** Resolution Reducing or Discontinuing Particular Kinds of Services—TK-12 Certificated  
**DEPARTMENT:** Human Resources  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board discuss the adoption of:  
1. Resolution No. 3023, reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services, and the corresponding amount of certificated staffing that will be reduced as a result (attachment 1).  
2. Resolution No. 3024, establishing criteria to apply to break a tie in seniority for certificated staff affected by program reductions and who have the same date of hire (attachment 2).  

**Action anticipated:** 03/09/2021  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The district is committed to building a sustainable budget that aligns resources with the Strategic Plan and Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP). This is addressed through the collective work of our entire community and the district is fortunate to have families, local leaders and employees who recognize and value the importance of public education. Instructional leaders are continually evaluating allocation of resources and program delivery models. To best meet the needs of San Juan Unified School District students, changes to the delivery model for certain services have been recommended for the 2021-22 school year. In an organization where nearly 90 percent of funding is spent on personnel, budget reductions may have an impact on jobs. Because of legal requirements and the timeline involved with approving a state budget, school districts must provide notice of any potential layoffs to employees well in advance of final budget decisions.  

This can be a very disruptive process; our hope is that by providing as much information as possible, questions and uncertainty can be reduced for employees, allowing us to maintain focus on our important work of teaching and learning.  

As a result of the need to make budget cuts, certain kinds of services rendered by certificated employees have been identified to be eliminated or reduced. In order to meet statutory notice requirements for potential reassignments or layoffs, the board needs to adopt the two resolutions specified above.  

**ATTACHMENT(S):**  
1. Resolution No. 3023, reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services.  
2. Resolution No. 3024, establishing criteria to apply to break a tie in seniority for certificated staff affected by program reductions and who have the same date of hire.

## RESOLUTION NO. 3024  

**BEFORE THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT**  

*(Resolution specifying criteria used in determining the order of termination of certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher on the same date)*  

WHEREAS, the board anticipates that it will be necessary to terminate the services of certificated employees effective at the close of this school year: and  

WHEREAS, this board has determined that as between certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher to the district on the same date, certain criteria should be used in determining the order of termination based upon the needs of the district and the students thereof.  

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FOUND, ORDERED, AND RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:  

1. Each and all of the foregoing recitals are true and correct.  

2. The criteria used to determine the order of termination of certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher to the district on the same date, and the weight to be given to such criteria, shall be the following:  

### a. Category I – Certifications and Experience  

**Need:** To retain teachers with: greatest flexibility of assignment based on California credentials held; National Board Certification; and/or experience teaching at school identified as District Designated Title I school.  

| Criteria                                                                 | Points |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Each full K-12 base credential (e.g., multiple subject, single subject, pupil personnel services, school nurse, librarian) | 4      |
| Each foundational level base credential                                   | 3      |
| Each intern permit                                                        | 2      |
| Each supplemental authorization                                            | 2      |
| Other services credential (administration)                               | 2      |
| National Board Certification                                               | 2      |
| Taught at a District Designated Title I School during the 2020-21 school year | 1      |

If there is still a tie after applying the above criteria, then Category II will be utilized.

<!-- Page 54 -->
![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Attachment+2)

Need: To recognize certificated experience in the San Juan Unified School District under contract which is not reflected by the employee’s seniority date.

| Experience | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Each year or portion of a year of in-district experience as a certificated employee under contract prior to the employee’s seniority date | Percentage of school year(s) served |

If there is still a tie after applying Category II criteria, then Category III will be utilized.

c. Category III - Lottery  
If any two or more certificated employees who first rendered paid service as probationary employees on the same date still have the same number of points after application of points provided above, the ranking of such employees shall be determined by a lottery conducted by the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources or designee.

3. The order of termination of certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher to the district on the same date as set forth above is based solely on the needs of this district and its students.

4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution to the contrary, a certificated employee shall be retained to render any service for which there is no certificated employee retained in the district with a higher number of points, as determined by the procedure set forth above, or with more seniority, who is certificated and competent to render such service.

5. This resolution shall be for the purpose of determining the relative order of termination of certain certificated employees as part of a layoff of certificated employees effective at the end of the 2020-2021 school year. This resolution shall not be effective for any other purposes, including, but not limited to, any subsequent layoffs of certificated employees.

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT**  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**AGENDA ITEM:** I-5  
**MEETING DATE:** 02/23/2021  

**SUBJECT:** Resolution Reducing or Discontinuing Particular Kinds of Services—Adult Education  

**DEPARTMENT:** Human Resources  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board discuss the adoption of:  
1. Resolution No. 3025, reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services, and the corresponding amount of certificated staffing that will be reduced as a result (attachment 1).  
2. Resolution No. 3026, establishing criteria to apply to break a tie in seniority for adult education certificated staff affected by program reductions and who have the same date of hire (attachment 2).  

**Action anticipated:** 03/09/2021  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The district is committed to building a sustainable budget that aligns resources with the Strategic Plan and Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP). This is addressed through the collective work of our entire community and the district is fortunate to have families, local leaders and employees who recognize and value the importance of public education. Instructional leaders are continually evaluating allocation of resources and program delivery models. To best meet the needs of San Juan Unified School District students, changes to the delivery model for certain services have been recommended for the 2021-22 school year. In an organization where nearly 90 percent (90%) of funding is spent on personnel, budget reductions may have an impact on jobs. Because of legal requirements and the timeline involved with approving a state budget, school districts must provide notice of any potential layoffs to employees well in advance of final budget decisions.  

As this can be a very disruptive process, our hope is that by providing as much information as possible, questions and uncertainly can be reduced for employees allowing us to maintain focus on our important work of teaching and learning.  

As a result of the need to make budget cuts, certain kinds of services rendered by certificated employees have been identified to be eliminated or reduced. In order to meet statutory notice requirements for potential reassignments or layoffs, the board needs to adopt the two resolutions specified above.  

**ATTACHMENT(S):**  
1: Resolution No. 3025, reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services—adult education.  
2: Resolution No. 3026, establishing criteria to apply to break a tie in seniority for adult education certificated staff affected by program reductions and who have the same date of hire.

## RESOLUTION NO. 3026

### BEFORE THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

(Resolution specifying criteria used in determining the order of termination of adult education certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher on the same date)

WHEREAS, the board anticipates that it will be necessary to terminate the services of certificated employees effective at the close of this school year: and

WHEREAS, this board has determined that as between certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher to the district on the same date, certain criteria should be used in determining the order of termination based upon the needs of the district and the students thereof.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FOUND, ORDERED, AND RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:

1. Each and all of the foregoing recitals are true and correct.

2. The criteria used to determine the order of termination of certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher to the district on the same date, and the weight to be given to such criteria, shall be the following:

   a. **Category I – Certifications and Experience**  
   Need: To retain teachers with: greatest flexibility of assignment based on California credentials held.

   | Criteria                                                      | Points |
   |--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
   | Each full base credential (e.g., designated subject, multiple subject, single subject, pupil personnel services) | 4      |
   | Each supplemental authorization                               | 2      |
   | Other services credential (administration)                  | 2      |

   If there is still a tie after applying the above criteria, then Category II will be utilized.

   b. **Category II – District Teaching Experience**  
   Need: To recognize certificated experience in the San Juan Unified School District under contract which is not reflected by the employee’s seniority date.
<!-- Page 62 -->
![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Attachment+2)

| Experience                                                                 | Value                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Each year or portion of a year of in-district experience as a certificated employee under contract prior to the employee’s seniority date. | Percentage of school year(s) served       |

If there is still a tie after applying Category II criteria, then Category III will be utilized.

c. Category III - Lottery

If any two or more certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary employee on the same date still have the same number of points after application of points provided above, the ranking of such employees shall be determined by a lottery conducted by the Assistant Superintendent, Human Resources or designee.

3. The order of termination of certificated employees who first rendered paid service as a probationary teacher to the district on the same date as set forth above is based solely on the needs of this district and its students.

4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution to the contrary, a certificated employee shall be retained to render any service for which there is no certificated employee retained in the district with a higher number of points, as determined by the procedure set forth above, or with more seniority, who is certificated and competent to render such service.

5. This resolution shall be for the purpose of determining the relative order of termination of certain certificated employees as part of a layoff of certificated employees effective at the end of the 2020-2021 school year. This resolution shall not be effective for any other purposes, including, but not limited to, any subsequent layoffs of certificated employees.

**SUBJECT:** REVISED Assignment of Teachers Outside  
Regular Base Credential  

**DEPARTMENT:** Human Resources  

---

### ACTION REQUESTED:
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve an addendum to Board Resolution No. 3011, dated October 27, 2020, which authorized the assignment of ninety (90) certificated employees (81.54 FTE) who hold regular base credentials outside these authorizations during the 2020-21 school year, per Education Code sections 44263 and 44256(b). The addendum, attachment A, will add seven (7) teachers (2.56 FTE).

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:
Per the California Education Code sections cited above, a teacher may be authorized by action of the governing board to teach subjects beyond their credential provided they hold a valid credential, have a prerequisite number of college units in the subject area, and agree to the assignment. A recent credential audit by the CalSAAS monitoring system identified certain mis-assignments and adding the teachers on attachment A to Board Resolution No. 3011 will correct the mis-assignments.

**Are you an incumbent Delegate?** Yes No If yes, year you became Delegate:  

**Why are you interested in becoming a Delegate?**  
CSBA provides invaluable support to LEAs, and participating at a deeper level will benefit our District. I currently work for the California Department of Public Health, which gives me a unique perspective and experience in navigating the health and safety of our students and staff. Additionally, I have eleven years of experience working for a school District where I worked with Maintenance & Operations, Finance and Student Services. I am passionate and knowledgeable about education and the management of a District, and this affords me the opportunity to provide my community a valuable service. I'm ready to take that advocacy to a new level.

**Please describe your activities and involvement on your local board, community, and/or CSBA.**  
I have participated on the Local Board for eight years. I’ve attended the county CSBA events, reviewed CSBA materials and attended the Annual CSBA conference. I’ve also represented other organizations such as Girl Scouts, International Association of Administrative Professionals and Classified School Employee's Union as a chapter officer, delegate, national delegate and in other capacities.

**What do you see as the biggest challenge facing governing boards and how can CSBA help address it?**  
Recovering from the effect of COVID-19 on school's finances is more than a challenge. However, this crisis also presents significant opportunity to leverage the response resources to advance California schools in many areas such as health, safety, technology, alternative educational delivery systems, and facilities improvement. CSBA is positioned to provide guidance to LEAs on how to take advantage of the available resources and to advocate for more resources that will help our schools be better-prepared for future emergencies as well as improve our every-day educational delivery systems and curricular options.

**Name:** Lisa M. Kaplan  
**District or COE:** Natomas Unified School District  
**Profession:** Education Attorney  
**Contact Number:** Cell: __________ Home: __________ Bus: __________  
**Primary E-mail:** kaplan4kids@gmail.com  
**Are you an incumbent Delegate?** Yes ☐ No ☑ If yes, year you became Delegate: 2009  

**Why are you interested in becoming a Delegate? Please describe the skills and experiences you would bring to the Delegate Assembly.**  
I firmly believe it is my responsibility to use my knowledge of the law, policy and budget for the greater good to benefit all of Natomas’ children, and as a delegate - all children in California. For the past 20 years, I’ve either worked at the California State Capitol, as a lobbyist or attorney. This area of expertise and knowledge is so important to effect change at the state level. I also bring a wealth of experience as an active member of Delegate Assembly having served as chair of nominating committee, member of the CSBA Leg committee, member of the governance review team and many other committees. This level of experience is invaluable so I can pass my knowledge and expertise on to the next generation of school board members. All together my knowledge and vast experience will serve to benefit CSBA and all our students and that is why I wish to remain a delegate and hope to have your vote.

**Please describe your activities and involvement on your local board, community, and/or CSBA.**  
Currently, I’m an attorney and governmental affairs consultant representing school districts, companies specializing in K-12 issues including but not limited to, special education, construction, bond financing, selling surplus property, as well as drafting legislation. As a currently delegate, I participate in delegate meetings, but also attend 2-3 meetings a year with our local Region 6, and as described above - I’ve served on numerous committees as a delegate. In Natomas, I have served on the facilities planning committee while we’re a fast growing district, the district’s safety committee, budget committee, nutrition committee and have actively volunteered to help pass bonds. For the past 7 years, I’ve funded a scholarship to provide chromebooks to low-income, foster and homeless students, and actively volunteer at our local food pantry that is run out of one of our high schools.

**What do you see as the biggest challenge facing governing boards and how can CSBA help address it?**  
The biggest challenges facing local boards at this moment is tackling the numerous issues as a result of the current pandemic. Most importantly districts are facing hard choices regarding safely reopening schools, making sure the effects of learning disruption are adequately addressed, including the student populations most negatively affected, potential budget cuts, the changing learning atmosphere as a result of distance learning and need to address connectivity and access to technology - and so many other items. As we move beyond this pandemic, CSBA must lead and advocate to fully fund education at a level comparable to other states...not in the bottom 10. It is no longer acceptable to fund education in CA around the 42nd in the Nation. CSBA can continue to push our grass roots plan, and pressure our state leaders to fully fund education. However, that in an of itself is going to be a challenge with the current budget, divergent top priorities of every elected and the fact that the required retirement pre-funding is going to bankrupt many school districts. As a delegate, I look forward to working to resolve these issues.

**Date:** 01/07/2021  

**Name:** Ed Short  
**District or CO:** Folsom Cordova USD  
**CSBA Region & subregion #:** 6-B  
**Profession:** Engineer  
**Contact Number (Cell | Home | Bus.):**  
**Primary E-mail:** eshort@fcusd.org  
**Are you an incumbent Delegate?** Yes  No  If yes, you became Delegate: 2010  

**Why are you interested in becoming a Delegate? Please describe the skills and experiences you would bring to the Delegate Assembly.**  
I believe, I can help make a difference in CSBA's policy making that will positively impact the public education system. Furthermore, the regional connection with other surrounding school board members help me to learn best or bad practices that can be shared with my district.  
I feel being a delegate helps increase my effectiveness in advancing public education priorities and my community involvement in increasing my sphere of influence.  

**Please describe your activities and involvement on your local board, community, and/or CSBA.**  
Fight for educational reform and make sure our teachers have the tools they need to teach and our kids have the resources they need to learn.  
Provide equal and relevant educational opportunity which will prepare all our kids for the 21st century and that meet or exceed the needs for local/Regional/Statewide employers.  
I am personally involved in local non-profit organizations that support kids in their success in education and lives.  

**What do you see as the biggest challenge facing governing boards and how can CSBA help address it?**  
#1: Recovering and getting through the impacts by the pandemic is our number one challenge! Coupled with staffing shortages through the track and trace and quarantine requirements. Teacher and resource shortages has been a major challenge to maintain in-person hybrid classes. I believe we can find ways to get kids back to in-person school safely. Keeping our staff and teachers safe as essential workers. CSBA can help districts with the creation of standard safe hybrid plans, advocate to the State that school staff and teachers are essential and possibly creating a pool of substitute teachers that districts can pull from.
