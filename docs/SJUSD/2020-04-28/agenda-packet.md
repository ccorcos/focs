**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the temporary site license agreement between AT&T and San Juan Unified School District for the cell tower site located at 6135 Sutter Avenue, Carmichael, California (Maintenance and Operations).  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
This license agreement pertains to the Maintenance and Operations cell tower site, where the district’s current agreement with Crown Castle will expire at the end of March. Crown Castle managed the cellular communications facility on behalf of AT&T; however, Crown Castle has confirmed its intent to remove itself from management of the tower, requiring AT&T to take over. AT&T’s counsel has proposed the attached temporary license agreement to allow AT&T to maintain and make required improvements to the site.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, Licensor and Licensee have agreed as follows:

# TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF LICENSE

1. **License of Licensed Site.** During the Term hereof, Licensor hereby licenses that certain portion of the Property as depicted on Exhibit A attached hereto (“Licensed Site”), and grants to Licensee the right to install, operate and maintain at Licensee’s expense and risk, temporary communications transmitting and receiving equipment, including (without limitation) antennas, poles, masts, transmission line(s), vehicles and accessories (collectively, the “Equipment”, as depicted on Exhibit A attached hereto) at the Licensed Site. Licensee shall at all times have the unrestricted right to enter or leave the Licensed Site with full and complete access to its Equipment on a twenty-four (24) hour, seven (7) day per week basis. Any changes to the Equipment on the License Site shall be subject to Licensor’s prior reasonable written approval, provided that (i) any changes to the Equipment within the Equipment Space which is not visible to Licensor or the general public from outside of the building where the Equipment Space is located or (ii) any replacement or upgrade of Equipment on the Tower which does not result in (A) a material increase in the structural load of the Tower or (B) a material change in the aesthetic appearance of Licensee’s Equipment installed on the Tower shall not require Licensor’s prior written approval.

2. **License Fee.** Commencing as of April 1, 2020 (the “License Fee Commencement Date”), Licensee shall pay Licensor the first (1st) installment of the License Fee for the first (1st) full month of the Term. The License Fee for each subsequent month shall be due and payable in full by not later than the first (1st) day of each month. Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a “grace period” of forty-five (45) days after Licensor’s approval of this License to deliver the first installment of the License Fee to Licensor. The License Fee shall be prorated for any partial month. Licensee’s obligation to pay the License Fee is subject to Licensor’s proper completion and delivery to Licensee of an IRS-W-9, IRS 1099 and Licensee’s Standard Payment Direction form, all of which are attached as Exhibit B.

3. **Term.** The term of this License is two (2) years (the “Term”) commencing on the License Fee Commencement Date. If Licensee remains in possession of the Licensed Site after the expiration of this License, then Licensee will be deemed to be occupying the Licensed Site on a month-to-month basis, which may be terminated by either party with thirty (30) days written notice.

4. **Taxes.** Licensee shall be solely responsible for the timely payment of personal property taxes which are directly attributable to the installation of the Equipment on the Property.

5. **Removal of Equipment and Licensed Site Condition.** Except as set forth herein, Licensee takes the Licensed Site as it finds it, and Licensor shall have no responsibility for its condition or any damage suffered by Licensee or any other person due to such condition. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties, Licensee shall remove all of the Equipment prior to the end of the Term, and Licensee shall leave the Licensed Site in substantially the same condition that existed as of the License Fee Commencement Date, ordinary wear and tear and occurrences for which Licensee is not responsible hereunder, excepted. Upon termination, Licensee shall be responsible for the cost to Licensor for repair of damages to the Licensed Site caused by Licensee, its employees, agents or contractors except to the extent caused by Licensor, its employees, agents or contractors within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of an invoice for the costs Licensor incurred. Licensor shall make the repairs.
<!-- Page 20 -->
6. Indemnification. Licensee shall indemnify, defend and hold Licensor harmless against any and all claims, liability, damages, expenses, or loss from the death or personal injury of any person, including any person who is an employee, subcontractor, independent contractor, or agent of Licensee, or the damage to or destruction of any property resulting from or arising out of the use or occupancy of the Property by Licensee, its employees, agents, officers, Board of Trustees, members of its Board of Trustees, and contractors (“Licensee Parties”); provided, however, Licensee shall have no obligation to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Licensor against any claims, liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the acts or omissions of Licensor, its employees, officers, agents and contractors (“Licensor Parties”), or any of them. Licensor shall indemnify, defend and hold Licensee harmless against any claims, liability or loss from personal injury or property damage resulting from or arising out of (1) the use or occupancy of the Property by Licensor Parties, or any of them, and (2) contamination of the Property subsurface or structures with hazardous substances; provided, however, Licensor shall have no obligation to indemnify, defend or hold harmless against any such claims, liabilities and losses as may be due to or caused by the acts or omissions of Licensee Parties, or any of them. The obligations under this Section 6 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this License.

7. Compliance with Laws/Operation of Equipment. Licensee agrees to comply with all federal state and local laws, orders, rules and regulations (“Laws”) applicable to Licensee’s use of the Equipment on the Property. Licensor agrees to comply with all Laws relating to Licensor’s ownership and use of the Property and any improvements on the Property. Licensee will install, operate and maintain its Equipment so as not to cause interference (as that term is defined in the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission), with any radio or television transmitting or receiving equipment located on the Property, provided that such Equipment is installed and operating in accordance with Laws. In the event that Licensee’s Equipment causes interference with other radio or television equipment which are installed and operated in accordance with Laws, Licensee will promptly take reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate the interference. If Licensee is unable to eliminate the interference within a reasonable period of time, Licensee agrees to remove the portion of the Equipment (except for maintenance testing) or remove the portion of the Equipment from the Licensed Site. Licensor agrees to reasonably assist Licensee at no additional expense to Licensee in obtaining and maintaining permits or approvals necessary for the operation and maintenance of the Equipment.

8. Electrical Service/Telephone Service. Licensee will be responsible for paying all utilities charges for electricity, telephone service or any other utility used or consumed by Licensee on the Licensed Site. Licensor acknowledges that Licensee provides a communication service which requires electrical power to operate and must operate twenty-four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week. If there is an emergency interruption in Licensee’s electrical service for an extended period of time, in Licensee’s reasonable determination, Licensor agrees to allow Licensee the right to bring on the Property in a location reasonably approved by Licensor a temporary generator for the duration of the interruption. In no event shall Licensor be responsible for providing electrical services to Licensee in the event of an emergency interruption in Licensee’s electrical service. Licensee will have the right to install utilities, at Licensee’s expense, and to improve present utilities on the Property and the Premises subject to Licensor’s reasonable approval of the manner and location of the installations. Licensee hereby grants to any service company providing utility or similar services, including electric power and telecommunications, to Licensee a license over the Property, from an open and improved public road to the Licensed Site, and upon the Licensed Site, for the purpose of constructing, operating and maintaining such lines, wires, circuits, and conduits, associated equipment cabinets and such appurtenances thereto, as such service companies may from time to time require in order to provide such services to the Premises. Upon Licensee’s or service company’s request, Licensor will execute a separate license evidencing this grant, at no cost to Licensee or the service company. Any utilities installed by or for the benefit of Licensee prior to the Effective Date are deemed approved by Licensor.

9. Default/Right to Cure. The following will be deemed a default by Licensee and a breach of this License: (i) non-payment of the License Fee if such License Fee remains unpaid for more than thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice from Licensor of such failure to pay; or (ii) Licensee's failure to perform any other term or condition.
<!-- Page 21 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Document+Image)  
under this License within forty-five (45) days after receipt of written notice from Licensor specifying the failure. No such failure, however, will be deemed to exist if Licensee has commenced to cure such default within such applicable period and provided that such efforts are prosecuted to completion with reasonable diligence. Delay in curing a default will be excused if due to causes beyond the reasonable control of Licensee. If Licensee remains in default beyond any applicable cure period, Licensor will have the right to exercise any and all rights and remedies available to it under law and equity.

10. Termination. Licensee shall have the right to terminate this License prior to the License Fee Commencement Date if, for any reason Licensee is unable to obtain, or maintain, any required approval(s) or the issuance of a license or permit by any agency, board, court or other governmental authority necessary for the construction or operation of the Equipment as now or hereafter intended by Licensee; or if Licensee determines, in its sole discretion, that the cost of obtaining or retaining the same is commercially unreasonable; or at any time after the License Fee Commencement Date, provided that Licensee delivers at least sixty (60) days prior written notice to Licensor of Licensee’s election to terminate the License. In the event that Licensee exercises its termination rights under this Section 10, it shall pay to Licensor an early termination fee equal to six (6) months of the then-current monthly License fee due to Licensor.

11. Damage to Licensed Site. If the Licensed Site or any portion thereof is damaged for any reason so as to render the Licensed Site unusable for Licensee’s intended purpose, the License Fee shall abate for such period as the Licensed Site is unusable. In addition, Licensee may, at its option, elect to terminate this License upon notice to Licensor.

12. Fingerprinting. Licensee must submit an executed Fingerprinting Notice and Acknowledgment, attached hereto as Exhibit C, within fifteen (15) days of executing this License or the Property, whichever date is first to occur.

13. Assignment. Licensee will have the right to assign this License in whole or in part, without Licensor’s consent to any Affiliate of Licensee and in connection with any sale or other transfer of substantially of Licensee’s assets in the FCC market where the Licensed Site is located. Upon notification to Licensor of such assignment, Licensee will be relieved of all future performance, liabilities and obligations under this License to the extent of such assignment. Any other assignment shall be subject to Licensor’s prior written consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

14. No Interest. The License herein created does not create any interest for Licensee in the Licensed Site or any property owned by Licensor, and is not coupled with any property interest or other interest.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
## BOARD OF EDUCATION

### AGENDA ITEM: G-2
### MEETING DATE: 04/28/2020

**SUBJECT:** California Voting Rights Act  
**DEPARTMENT:** Legal Services  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the Board of Education consider the adoption of Resolution No. 2991, declaring an intent to temporarily postpone hearings related to the board’s transition to by-trustee area elections until such time as neither state nor local public health officials recommend or impose social distancing measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The San Juan Unified School District’s Board of Education is currently elected under an “at-large” election system, where board members are elected by voters of the entire district. Board members are elected in even-numbered years and serve staggered, four-year terms, such that the next election for three (3) board members is scheduled for November 2020, with the remaining two (2) board members’ seats scheduled for election in November 2022. On March 10, 2020, the board adopted Resolution No. 2982, declaring its intent to transition from at-large to by-trustee area board elections, where each board member must reside within the designated trustee-area boundary, and is elected only by the voters in that trustee area. On March 31, 2020, the district’s demographer presented information on the process and potential criteria for drawing the trustee-area boundary maps. At the April 14, 2020, meeting, the superintendent pulled the presentation and the second of two statutorily required hearings to evaluate the Governor’s Executive Order N-48-20, signed April 9, 2020, and the effect it would have on the district’s transition process.

WHEREAS, the Board of Education (“board”) of the San Juan Unified School District (“district”) is elected “at-large,” meaning that each trustee is elected by voters of the entire district;

WHEREAS, on March 10, 2020, the board adopted Resolution #2982, declaring its intent to transition from at-large to by-trustee area board elections;

# Criteria to Guide the Establishment of Trustee-Areas

1. The boundaries of the trustee areas shall be established so that the trustee-areas are at least as nearly equal in population as required by law.

2. The boundaries of the trustee areas shall not be gerrymandered in violation of the principles established by the United States Supreme Court in *Shaw v. Reno*, 509 U.S. 630 (1993), and other applicable law.

3. The boundaries of the trustee areas shall be established so that the trustee areas do not result in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen to vote on account of race or color as provided in Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act.

4. The boundaries of the trustee areas shall be compact, insofar as practicable.

5. The boundaries of the trustee areas shall be created to contain contiguous territory, insofar as practicable.

6. The boundaries of the trustee areas shall observe communities of interest, insofar as practicable.

7. The boundaries of the trustee areas shall consider the location of the district’s high schools and their respective attendance areas, insofar as practicable.

8. The boundaries of the trustee-areas may consider visible features, such as topography and geography, including mountains, flat land, forest lands, man-made geographical features such as highways and canals, etc., insofar as practicable.

9. To maintain a longer-term population balance, trustee-areas known to be areas of higher-than-average population growth following redistricting may be under-populated within the population deviation amounts allowed by law. To the extent legally allowed, this shall include consideration of anticipated future growth under applicable general plans.

10. The boundaries of the trustee areas may consider avoiding pairing two or more incumbents in a single trustee area, to the extent legally allowable.

11. The boundaries of the trustee-areas shall comply with such other factors which become known during the redistricting process and are formally adopted by the board.

The San Juan Unified School District’s Board of Education is currently elected under an “at-large” election system, where board members are elected by voters of the entire District. Board members are elected in even-numbered years and serve staggered, four-year terms, such that the next election for three board members is scheduled for November 2022, with the remaining board members seats scheduled for election in November 2022. On March 10, 2020, the board adopted Resolution #2982, declaring its intent to transition from at-large to by-trustee area board elections, where each board member must reside within the designated trustee area boundary, and is elected only by the voters in that trustee area.

On April 9, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, Governor Newsom issued Executive Order N-48-20, ordering that both the public hearing and safe harbor timelines associated with a transition from at-large to by-trustee area elections were tolled effective March 20, 2020, until such time as neither state nor local public health officials recommend or impose social distancing measures in the relevant subdivision.

In issuing this order, Governor Newsom explained that holding these public hearings “in the near future—at a time when public health requires that Californians stay home except for essential needs—would threaten public health and safety, and would

**AVISO DE REUNIÓN**  

Por la presente se da AVISO de que, debido a la pandemia de COVID-19 y las preocupaciones relacionadas con la salud pública, la junta considerará posponer temporalmente el proceso de audiencia pública relacionado con la transición a las elecciones de área de consejeros en su reunión **telefónica** programada regularmente para el martes, 28 de abril de 2020.

La reunión telefónica está programada de la siguiente manera:

| FECHA                       | HORARIO         | LUGAR                     |

La Junta de Educación del Distrito Escolar Unificado de San Juan se elige actualmente bajo un sistema electoral "en general", donde los miembros de la junta son elegidos por los votantes de todo el Distrito. Los miembros de la junta se eligen en años pares y sirven términos escalonados de cuatro años, de modo que la próxima elección para tres miembros de la junta está programada para noviembre de 2020, y los escaños restantes para los miembros de la junta están programados para noviembre de 2022. El 10 de marzo de 2020 la junta adoptó la Resolución #2982, donde declaró su intención de hacer la transición de las elecciones de la junta general al área de consejeros, donde cada miembro de la junta debe residir dentro del límite designado del área de consejero, y es elegido solo por los votantes en esa área de consejero.

El 9 de abril de 2020, en respuesta a la pandemia de COVID-19, el Gobernador Newsom emitió la Orden Ejecutiva N-48-20, ordenando que tanto la audiencia pública como los plazos de salvaguarda asociados con una transición de elecciones generales a áreas de consejeros fueran penalizadas a partir del 20 de marzo de 2020, hasta el momento en que ni los funcionarios de salud pública estatales ni locales recomiendan que impongan medidas de distanciamiento social en la subdivisión correspondiente.

Al emitir esta orden, el Gobernador Newsom explicó que celebrar estas audiencias públicas "en un futuro cercano, en un momento en que la salud pública requiere que los californianos se queden en casa, excepto por necesidades esenciales, amenazaría la salud y la seguridad públicas, y obligaría a los californianos a elegir entre participar en su proceso democrático y salvaguardar su propia salud y seguridad, así como la salud y seguridad de sus comunidades". 

En la reunión del 28 de abril de 2020, la junta revisará las Órdenes Ejecutivas del Gobernador Newsom y otra información relevante, antes de considerar la adopción de.
