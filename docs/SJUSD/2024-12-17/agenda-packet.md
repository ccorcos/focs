Course Outlines for all apportionment classes shall be on file and available for review at the adult school or the district office (5 CCR 10508).

To meet optimum educational standards, these course outlines should contain:

Adult Education Handbook for California (2023)]

Career Technical Education: Before establishing a career technical education training program, each member of a local adult education consortium, or the consortium as a whole, shall conduct a job market study of the labor market area in which it proposes to establish the career technical education training program or rely upon the most recent job market study of the labor market area conducted by the local workforce development board. The study shall use local labor market information and consider a supply analysis of existing career technical education training programs for adults maintained by high schools, community colleges, and other postsecondary educational institutions in the geographic area to ensure that the anticipated employment demand for adults enrolled in the proposed training program justifies the establishment of the proposed courses of instruction (EC 84906(a)(3)(A)).
<!-- Page 31 -->
After completing the job market study and before establishing the career technical education training program, the governing body of a member of a local adult education consortium, or the consortium as a whole, as applicable, shall determine if the job market study justifies the proposed career technical education program (EC 84906(a)(3)(B).

Refer to the Job Market Study in 84906(a) for more information. Education Codes: 1900; 41976; 52506; 52515; 52518; 52570.

(Gov. Code §8350 et seq.)

**NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD CERTIFICATION:** Contractor certifies that no more than one (1) final adjudication has been issued against a Federal contractor in the immediately preceding two-year period because of Contractor’s failure to comply with an order of a Federal court, which orders Contractor to comply with an order of the National Labor Relations Board.

**DOING BUSINESS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA**

The following laws apply to persons or entities doing business with the State of California.

**CONFLICT OF INTEREST:** Contractor needs to be aware of the following provisions regarding current or former state employees. If Contractor has any questions on the status of any person rendering services or involved with the Agreement, the awarding agency must be contacted immediately for clarification.

Current State Employees (Pub. Contract Code §10410):
(a) No officer or employee shall engage in any employment, activity or enterprise from which the officer or employee receives compensation or has a financial interest and which is sponsored or funded by any state agency, unless the employment, activity or enterprise is required as a condition of regular state employment.
(b) No officer or employee shall contract on his or her own behalf as an independent contractor with any state agency to provide goods or services.

Former State Employees (Pub. Contract Code §10411):
(a) For the two-year period from the date of his or her state employment, no former state officer or employee may enter into a contract in which he or she engaged in any of the negotiations, transactions, planning, arrangements or any part of the decision-making process relevant to the contract while employed in any capacity by any state agency.

(b) For the twelve-month period from the date he or she left state employment, no former state officer or employee may enter into a contract with any state agency if he or she was employed by that state agency in a policy-making position in the same general subject area as the proposed contract within the 12-month period prior to his or her leaving state employment.

(c) If Contractor violates any provisions of above paragraphs, such action by Contractor shall render this Agreement void. (Pub. Contract Code §10420)

(d) Members of boards and commissions are exempt from this section if they do not receive payment other than payment of each meeting of the board or commission, payment for preparatory time and payment for per diem. (Pub. Contract Code §10430 (e))

**LABOR CODE/WORKERS' COMPENSATION:** Contractor needs to be aware of the provisions which require every employer to be insured against liability for Worker’s Compensation or to undertake self-insurance in accordance with the provisions, and Contractor affirms to comply with such provisions before commencing the performance of the work of this Agreement. (Labor Code Section 3700)

**AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT:** Contractor assures the State that it complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, as well as all applicable regulations and guidelines issued pursuant to the ADA. (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.)

**CONTRACTOR NAME CHANGE:** An amendment is required to change the Contractor’s name as listed on this Agreement. Upon receipt of legal documentation of the name change the State will process the amendment. Payment of invoices presented with a new name cannot be paid prior to approval of said amendment.

**CORPORATE QUALIFICATIONS TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA:** When agreements are to be performed in the state by corporations, the contracting agencies will be verifying that the contractor is currently qualified to do business in California in order to ensure that all obligations due to the state are fulfilled.

"Doing business" is defined in R&T Code Section 23101 as actively engaging in any transaction for the purpose of financial or pecuniary gain or profit. Although there are some statutory exceptions to taxation, rarely will a corporate contractor performing within the state not be subject to the franchise tax.

Both domestic and foreign corporations (those incorporated outside of California) must be in good standing in order to be qualified to do business in California. Agencies will determine whether a corporation is in good standing by calling the Office of the Secretary of State.

RESOLUTION: A county, city, district, or other local public body must provide the State with a copy of a resolution, order, motion, or ordinance of the local governing body which by law has authority to enter into an agreement, authorizing execution of the agreement.

**Audit Committee**  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**

**Opinions**  
We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the San Juan Unified School District, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the San Juan Unified School District’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the San Juan Unified School District, as of June 30, 2024, and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Basis for Opinions**  
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Government Auditing Standards). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the San Juan Unified School District, and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**  
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the San Juan Unified School District’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the San Juan Unified School District’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the San Juan Unified School District’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

## Required Supplementary Information

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 4 to 10 and the General Fund Budgetary Comparison Schedule, the Schedule of Changes in the District’s Total Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) Liability, the Schedule of the District’s Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability, and the Schedule of the District’s Contributions on pages 54 to 59 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

![Supplementary Information](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Supplementary+Information)

**Supplementary Information**

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the San Juan Unified School District's basic financial statements. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards, as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards and other supplementary information as listed in the table of contents are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, except for that portion marked "unaudited," was derived from, and relates directly to, the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole. The information marked "unaudited" has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it.

**Other Information**

Management is responsible for the other information included in the financial statements. The other information comprises the Organization page but does not include the basic financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the financial statements, or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required to describe it in our report.

**Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards**

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 11, 2024 on our consideration of the San Juan Unified School District’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the San Juan Unified School District’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the San Juan Unified School District’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

San Juan Unified School District  
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2024  

The management’s discussion and analysis of San Juan Unified School District’s financial performance provides an overall review of the District’s financial activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The intent of this discussion and analysis is to look at the District’s financial performance as a whole. To provide a complete understanding of the District’s financial performance, please read it in conjunction with the Independent Auditor’s Report on page 1 through 3, the District’s financial statements which begin on page 11, and the notes to the financial statements on pages 24 through 53.

The Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is an element of the reporting model adopted by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) in their Statement No. 34 Basic Financial Statements – and Management’s Discussion and Analysis – for State and Local Governments issued June 1999. Certain comparative information is required to be presented in the MD&A.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

This annual report consists of three parts: (1) management's discussion and analysis (this section); (2) the financial statements; and (3) required supplementary information. The financial statements include two kinds of statements that present different views of the San Juan Unified School District.  
- The first two statements are district-wide financial statements that provide both short-term and long-term information about the District's overall financial status.  
- The remaining statements are fund financial statements that focus on individual parts of the District, report the District's operations and in more detail than the district wide statements.  

The financial statements also include notes that explain some of the information in the statements and provide more detailed data. The statements are followed by a section of required supplementary information that further explains and supports the financial statements with a comparison of the District's budget for the year. The remainder of the management's discussion and analysis highlights the structure and contents of each of the statements.

The district-wide statements report information about the District as a whole. The statement of net position includes all of the District's assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and deferred inflows of resources. All of the current year revenues and expenditures are accounted for in the statement of activities regardless of when cash is received or paid.

The two district-wide statements report the District's assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and deferred inflows of resources as a measure of the District's financial position.

70  
<!-- Page 71 -->
In the district-wide financial statements the District's activities are divided into two categories:

- **Governmental activities** – Most of the District's basic services are included here, such as regular and special education, transportation, and administration. State support from local control funding formula and categorical apportionments finance most of these activities.

- **Business-type activities** – The District does not currently have any business type activities.

### Fund Financial Statements

The fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the District's most significant funds. Funds are accounting devices the District uses to keep track of specific sources of funding and spending on particular programs:

- Some funds are required by State law and by bond covenants.

- The District establishes other funds to control and manage money for particular purposes (like repaying its long-term debts) or to show that it is properly using certain revenues (like federal grants).

The District has three kinds of funds:

- **Governmental Funds** - Most of the District's basic services are included in governmental funds, which generally focus on (1) how cash, and other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash, flow in and out and (2) the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. Consequently, the governmental funds statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps you determine whether there are more or fewer financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the District's programs. Because this information does not encompass the additional long-term focus of the district-wide statements, we provide additional information at the bottom of the governmental funds statements that explain the relationship (or differences) between them.

- **Proprietary Funds** - Services for which the District charges a fee are generally reported in proprietary funds. Proprietary funds are reported in the same way as the district-wide statements. Internal service funds are used to report activities that provide supplies and services for the District's other programs and activities. The District currently has one internal service fund -- the employee self-insurance fund.
<!-- Page 72 -->
- Fiduciary Funds - The District is the trustee, or fiduciary, for assets that belong to others, such as the scholarship fund. The District is responsible for ensuring that the assets reported in these funds are used only for their intended purposes and by those to whom the assets belong.

## FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRICT AS A WHOLE

The District's ending net position was $355,434,058 on June 30, 2024, resulting in an increase from the prior fiscal period by $169,800,061.

| **Total Net Position** | **355,434,058** | **185,633,997** | **169,800,061** | **91%**  |

The change in Total Assets is primarily a result of the following:

- Current and other assets include cash, including cash with fiscal agent, receivables, investments, due from (to) other funds, stores inventory and pre-paid expenses. Current assets increased by $72,665,719 due to cash received from one-time grants received prior to June 30 and an increase in the stores balance.

- At the end of fiscal year 2023-24, the District had a total value of $1,565,417,310 in capital assets. Capital assets include land, buildings, land improvements, equipment and capital projects that are still in progress. Total accumulated depreciation amounted to $485,459,019. The net capital assets amounted to $1,079,958,291, an increase of $107,131,015 from prior year. This is a result of increased capital projects being handled and completed through Measures J, N and P.

| **Capital Assets, net** | **1,079,958,291** | **972,827,276** | **107,131,015** | **11%** |

The change in Total Liabilities is primarily a result of the following:

- A decrease in current liabilities of $37,041,644 is attributable to fewer goods and services received prior to June 30, 2024 that had not been paid and unearned revenue. Current liabilities include accounts payable, unearned revenue, interagency balances and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. (See “Statement of Net Position” chart.)
  
- The District ended the year with a total of $1,458,798,523 in outstanding financing obligations, including other post-employment benefits (OPEB), compensated absences and net pension liabilities. The increase in long-term debt of $121,430,195 is mainly attributed to net pension liabilities and issuance of general obligation bonds.

![Financial Highlights](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Financial+Highlights)

**FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**

The District’s change in net position from prior year was $169,800,061. Revenues increased by $33,081,802 which is primarily attributable to the increase in taxes and subventions, interest, federal and state resources. Expenditures have a net increase of $45,571,812 which is primarily due to increased costs of instruction related staffing and instructional materials, increase in student support service expense from pandemic related resources and other one-time funding being spent in the current year and a decrease in general administration costs.

The District’s General Fund overall experienced an increase in its fund balance by $72,438,222. Revenue increased by $10.7 million which is mainly due to the LCFF calculation, mandated cost reimbursements, Special Education grants, and additional COVID Relief funds.

The District also experienced an overall increase in expenditures. There were increases in certificated salaries due to negotiation salary increases, additional training and staffing changes as the District continues to spend the Federal COVID-19 funds and other one-time funds to provide additional support and service functions for students. There was an increase in supplies and capital outlay to supply students and staff with the necessary supplies, for additional instructional supports. This included additional summer programs to mitigate the learning losses students were facing.

**Enrollment**

The District experienced an increase in student enrollment between FY22-23 and FY 23-24. An increase is also expected to be seen in FY 24-25.

**FINANCIAL ISSUES**

The development of future budgets will be influenced by uncertain, external variables such as the State Budget, priorities of new state leadership, and pension costs. Internal factors of compensation and number of employees must be commensurate with the number of students. San Juan Unified School District must be vigilant in monitoring all expenditures to avoid fiscal distress.

The district has adopted a range of instructional models and opportunities to support the academic and social and emotional needs of all students in response to the impact of the pandemic.

Total fund balances - Governmental Funds $ 587,751,325

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of net position are different because:

Capital assets used for governmental activities are not financial resources and, therefore, are not reported as assets in governmental funds. The cost of the assets is $1,565,417,310 and the accumulated depreciation is $485,459,019 (Note 4). 1,079,958,291

Long-term liabilities are not due and payable in the current period and, therefore, are not reported as liabilities in the funds. Long-term liabilities at June 30, 2024 consisted of (Note 6):

- General Obligation Bonds $ (733,023,796)
- Accreted interest (60,025,936)

- Total OPEB liability (Note 10) (116,864,462)
- Net pension liability (Notes 8 and 9) (498,603,000)
- Compensated absences (8,266,420)
Total (1,458,798,623)

Losses on the refunding of debt are recognized as expenditures in the period they are incurred. In the government-wide statements, they are categorized as deferred outflows and are amortized over the shorter life of the refunded or refunding debt. 5,026,591

Internal service funds are included in the government-wide financial statements. 50,800,645

In government funds, deferred outflows and inflows of resources relating to pensions are not reported because they are applicable to future periods. In the statement of net position, deferred outflows and inflows of resources relating to pensions are reported (Notes 8 and 9).

- Deferred outflows of resources relating to pensions $ 190,349,539
- Deferred inflows of resources relating to pensions (54,191,000)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### June 30, 2024

### NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

San Juan Unified School District (the “District”) accounts for its financial transactions in accordance with the policies and procedures of the California Department of Education’s California School Accounting Manual. The accounting policies of the District conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. The following is a summary of the more significant policies:

**Reporting Entity:** The Board of Education is the level of government which has governance responsibilities over all activities related to public school education in the San Juan Unified School District. The Board is not included in any other governmental “reporting entity” as defined by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board since Board members have decision-making authority, the power to designate management, the responsibility to significantly influence operations and primary accountability for fiscal matters.

**Basis of Presentation - Financial Statements:** The basic financial statements include a Management’s Discussion and Analysis section providing an analysis of the District’s overall financial position and results of operations, financial statements prepared using full accrual accounting for all of the District’s activities, including infrastructure, and a focus on the major funds.

**Basis of Presentation - Government-Wide Financial Statements:** The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities display information about the reporting government as a whole. Custodial funds are not included in the government-wide financial statements. Custodial funds are reported only in the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position at the fund financial statement level.

The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities are prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues, expenses, gains, losses, assets and liabilities resulting from exchange and exchange-like transactions are recognized when the exchange takes place. Revenues, expenses, gains, losses, assets and liabilities resulting from nonexchange transactions are recognized in accordance with the requirements of Governmental Accounting Standards Board Codification Section (GASB Cod. Sec.) N50.118-.121.

**Program revenues:** Program revenues included in the Statement of Activities derive directly from the program itself or from parties outside the District’s taxpayers or citizenry, as a whole; program revenues reduce the cost of the function to be financed from the District’s general revenues.

**Allocation of indirect expenses:** The District reports all direct expenses by function in the Statement of Activities. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a function. Depreciation expense is specifically identified and is included in the direct expense of each function. Interest on general long-term liabilities is considered an indirect expense and is reported separately on the Statement of Activities.

**Basis of Presentation - Fund Accounting:** The accounts of the District are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered to be a separate accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, deferred outflows, liabilities, deferred inflows, fund equity, revenues, and expenditures or expenses, as appropriate. District resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled.

**NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)**

**A - Major Funds**

The General Fund is the general operating fund of the District and accounts for all revenues and expenditures of the District not encompassed within other funds. All general tax revenues and other receipts that are not allocated by law or contractual agreement to some other fund are accounted for in this fund. General operating expenditures and the capital improvement costs that are not paid through other funds are paid from the General Fund.

The Building Fund is a capital projects fund used to account for resources used for the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities by the District.

The Bond Interest and Redemption Fund is a debt service fund used to account for the accumulation of resources for the payment of principal and interest related to the General Obligation Bonds.

**B - Other Funds**

Special Revenue Funds are used to account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are legally restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. This includes the Student Activity, the Charter Schools, Adult Education, Child Development, Cafeteria and Deferred Maintenance Funds.

Capital Projects Funds are used to account for resources used for the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities by the District. This includes the Capital Facilities and the County School Facilities Funds.

The Self-Insurance Fund is an internal service fund which is used to account for the District’s workers’ compensation claims, employee vision and dental benefits.

The Special Education Pass-Through Fund is a Custodial Fund used by the District to account for Special Education pass-through funds.

**Basis of Accounting:** Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures or expenses are recognized in the accounts and reported in the basic financial statements. Basis of accounting relates to the timing of the measurement made, regardless of the measurement focus applied.

**Accrual:** Governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements and the proprietary and fiduciary fund financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred.

**Modified Accrual:** The governmental funds financial statements are presented on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under the modified accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recorded when susceptible to accrual; i.e., both measurable and available. “Available” means collectible within the current period or within 60 days after year end. Expenditures are generally recognized under the modified accrual basis of accounting when the related liability is incurred. The exception to this general rule is that principal and interest on general obligation long-term liabilities, if any, is recognized when due.

**Budgets and Budgetary Accounting:** By state law, the Board of Education must adopt a final budget by July 1. A public hearing is conducted to receive comments prior to adoption. The Board of Education complied with these requirements.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### June 30, 2024  

### NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  

**Receivables:** Receivables are made up principally of amounts due from the State of California and Categorical programs. The District has determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts was needed as of June 30, 2024.  

**Stores Inventory:** Stores inventory in the General and Cafeteria Funds consists mainly of consumable supplies held for future use and are valued at actual cost. Inventories are recorded as expenditures at the time individual inventory items are transferred from the warehouse to schools and offices.  

**Capital Assets:** Capital assets purchased or acquired, with an original cost of $15,000 or more, are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost. Contributed assets are reported at acquisition value for the contributed asset. Additions, improvements and other capital outlay that significantly extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Other costs incurred for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Capital assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over 4 - 30 years depending on asset types.  

**Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources:** In addition to assets, the statement of net position includes a separate section for deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of net position that applies to a future period(s), and as such will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditures) until then. The District has recognized deferred loss on refunding resulting from the difference in the carrying value of refunded debt and its reacquisition price. This amount is deferred and amortized over the shorter life of the refunded or refunding debt. Additionally, the District has recognized a deferred outflow of resources related to the recognition of the net pension liability and total OPEB liability reported in the Statement of Net Position.  

In addition to liabilities, the statement of net position includes a separate section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s) and as such, will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time. The District has recognized a deferred inflow of resources related to the recognition of the net pension liability and total OPEB liability reported which is in the Statement of Net Position.  

**Pensions:** For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the State Teachers’ Retirement Plan (STRP) and Public Employers Retirement Fund B (PERF B) and additions to/deductions from STRP’s and PERF B’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by STRP an PERF B. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Certain investments are reported at fair value. The following is a summary of pension amounts in aggregate:  

|                     | STRP         | PERF B       | Total         |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Deferred outflows of resources | $ 190,349,539 | $ 81,030,451 | $ 190,349,539 |
| Deferred inflows of resources  | $ 49,166,000  | $ 5,025,000  | $ 54,191,000  |
| Net pension liability           | $ 284,800,000 | $ 213,803,000| $ 498,603,000 |
| Pension expense                 | $ 57,968,479  | $ 36,834,604 | $ 94,803,083  |

**NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)**

**Interfund Activity:** Interfund activity is reported as either loans, services provided, reimbursements or transfers. Loans are reported as interfund receivables and payables as appropriate and are subject to elimination upon consolidation. Services provided, deemed to be at market or near market rates, are treated as revenues and expenditures/expenses. Reimbursements are when one fund incurs a cost, charges the appropriate benefiting fund and reduces its related cost as a reimbursement. All other interfund transactions are treated as transfers. Transfers between governmental or proprietary funds are netted as part of the reconciliation to the government-wide financial statements. Net amounts due between governmental and fiduciary funds are classified as due to fiduciary.

**Compensated Absences:** Compensated absences benefits totaling $8,266,420 are recorded as a long-term liability of the District. The liability is for the earned but unused benefits.

**Accumulated Sick Leave:** Sick leave benefits are accumulated for each employee. The employees do not gain a vested right to accumulated sick leave. Accumulated employee sick leave benefits are not recognized as liabilities of the District since cash payment of such benefits is not probable. Therefore, sick leave benefits are recorded as expenditures in the period that sick leave is taken.

**Unearned Revenue:** Revenue from federal, state, and local special projects and programs is recognized when qualified expenditures have been incurred. Funds received but not earned are recorded as unearned revenue until earned.

**Net Position:** Net position is displayed in three components:

1. **Net Investment in Capital Assets** - Consists of capital assets including restricted capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and reduced by the outstanding balances (excluding unspent bond proceeds) of any bonds, mortgages, notes or other borrowings that are attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets.

2. **Restricted Net Position** - Restrictions of the ending net position indicate the portions of net position not appropriate for expenditure or amounts legally segregated for a specific future use. The restriction for legally restricted programs represents the portion of net position restricted to specific program expenditures. The restriction for debt service represents the portion of net position available for the retirement of debt. The restriction for capital projects represents the portion of net position restricted for capital projects. The restriction for self-insurance represents the portion of net position restricted for payment of the self-insured claims. It is the District's policy to use restricted net position first when allowable expenditures are incurred.

3. **Unrestricted Net Position** - All other net position that does not meet the definitions of "restricted" or "net investment in capital assets".

**Fund Balance Classifications:** Governmental Accounting Standards Board Codification Sections 1300 and 1800, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions (GASB Cod. Sec. 1300 and 1800) implements a five-tier fund balance classification hierarchy that depicts the extent to which a government is bound by spending constraints imposed on the use of its resources. The five classifications, discussed in more detail below, are nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned and unassigned.

**A - Nonspendable Fund Balance:**

The nonspendable fund balance classification reflects amounts that are not in spendable form, such as revolving fund cash, prepaid expenditures and stores inventory.

**NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)**

**B - Restricted Fund Balance:**

The restricted fund balance classification reflects amounts subject to externally imposed and legally enforceable constraints. Such constraints may be imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments, or may be imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. These are the same restrictions used to determine restricted net position as reported in the government-wide statements.

**C - Committed Fund Balance:**

The committed fund balance classification reflects amounts subject to internal constraints self-imposed by formal action of the Board of Education. The constraints giving rise to committed fund balance must be imposed no later than the end of the reporting period. The actual amounts may be determined subsequent to that date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Formal action by the Board of Education is required to remove any commitment from any fund balance. At June 30, 2024, the District had $45,769,461 in committed fund balances.

**D - Assigned Fund Balance:**

The assigned fund balance classification reflects amounts that the District's Board of Education has approved to be used for specific purposes, based on the District’s intent related to those specific purposes. The Board of Education can designate personnel with the authority to assign fund balances, however as of June 30, 2024, no such designation has occurred.

**E - Unassigned Fund Balance:**

In the General Fund only, the unassigned fund balance classification reflects the residual balance that has not been assigned to other funds and that is not restricted, committed, or assigned to specific purposes.

In any fund other than the General Fund, a positive unassigned fund balance is never reported because amounts in any other fund are assumed to have been assigned, at least, to the purpose of that fund. However, deficits in any fund, including the General Fund that cannot be eliminated by reducing or eliminating amounts assigned to other purposes are reported as negative unassigned fund balance.

**Fund Balance Policy:** The District has an expenditure policy relating to fund balances. For purposes of fund balance classifications, expenditures are to be spent from restricted fund balances first, followed in order by committed fund balances (if any), assigned fund balances and lastly unassigned fund balances.

While GASB Cod. Sec. 1300 and 1800 do not require districts to establish a minimum fund balance policy or a stabilization arrangement, GASB Cod. Sec. 1300 and 1800 do require the disclosure of a minimum fund balance policy and stabilization arrangements, if they have been adopted by the Board of Education. At June 30, 2024, the District has not established a minimum fund balance policy nor has it established a stabilization arrangement.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### June 30, 2024  

**NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)**  

**Property Taxes:** Secured property taxes are attached as an enforceable lien on property as of March 1. Taxes are due in two installments on or before December 10 and April 10. Unsecured property taxes are due in one installment on or before August 31. The County of Sacramento bills and collects taxes for the District. Tax revenues are recognized by the District when received.  

**Eliminations and Reclassifications:** In the process of aggregating data for the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities, some amounts reported as interfund activity and balances in the funds were eliminated or reclassified. Interfund receivables and payables were eliminated to minimize the “grossing up” effect on assets and liabilities within the governmental activities column.  

**Estimates:** The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures or expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results may differ from those estimates.  

**NOTE 2 - CASH AND INVESTMENTS**  

Cash and investments at June 30, 2024 consisted of the following:  

| **Governmental Activities** | **Fiduciary Activities** |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|

**Pooled Funds:** In accordance with Education Code Section 41001, the District maintains substantially all of its cash in the interest-bearing Sacramento County Treasurer’s Pooled Investment Fund. The District is considered to be an involuntary participant in an external investment pool. The fair value of the District’s investment in the pool is reported in the financial statements at amounts based upon the District’s pro rata share of the fair value provided by the County Treasurer for the entire portfolio (in relation to the amortized cost of that portfolio). The balance available for withdrawal is based on the accounting records maintained by the County Treasurer, which is recorded on the amortized cost basis.  

**Deposits - Custodial Credit Risk:** The District limits custodial credit risk by ensuring uninsured balances are collateralized by the respective financial institution. Cash balances held in banks are insured up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and are collateralized by the respective financial institution. At June 30, 2024, the carrying amount of the District’s accounts was $2,813,202 and the bank balance was $4,664,356, of which $4,414,356 was uninsured.

Interest Rate Risk: The District does not have a formal investment policy that limits cash and investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. At June 30, 2024, the District had no significant interest rate risk related to cash and investments held.

Credit Risk: The District does not have a formal investment policy that limits its investment choices other than the limitations of state law.

Concentration of Credit Risk: The District does not place limits on the amount it may invest in any one issuer. At June 30, 2024, the District had no concentration of credit risk.

NOTE 3 - INTERFUND TRANSACTIONS

Interfund Activity: Transactions between funds of the District are recorded as interfund transfers, except for the Self-Insurance Fund activity which is recorded as income and expenditures of the Self-Insurance Fund and the General Fund, respectively.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### June 30, 2024  

### NOTE 5 - SELF-INSURANCE  

The District has established a self-insurance fund to account for the risk of loss for workers' compensation, employee vision benefits and employee dental benefits. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded coverage in any of the past five fiscal years. There has been no reduction in insurance coverage from the previous year.

The Self-Insurance Fund provides coverage up to statutory limits for each workers’ compensation claim. Beginning July 1, 1996 up to June 30, 2001 the District was fully insured for workers’ compensation losses with Fireman's Fund. On July 1, 2001, the District returned to a self-insured program. This program provides coverage up to $750,000 per occurrence. The District has coverage for claims in excess of this amount through Safety National Casualty Corporation. All other benefits covered by the Self-Insurance Fund are fully insured with no excess coverage purchased.

The workers’ compensation claims liability of $2,887,000 is based on an actuarial study as of June 30, 2024 discounted at 0.5 percent. The Dental and Vision claims liabilities of $190,718 and $9,422, respectively are calculated based on an incremental lag factor methodology. Changes in the Fund’s claims liability for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:

| Workers’ Compensation | Dental | Vision | Total |
|-----------------------|--------|--------|-------|

# NOTE 8 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – STATE TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT PLAN

## General Information about the State Teachers’ Retirement Plan

**Plan Description:** Teaching-certified employees of the District are provided with pensions through the State Teachers’ Retirement Plan (STRP) - a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS). The Teachers' Retirement Law (California Education Code Section 22000 et seq.), as enacted and amended by the California Legislature, established this plan and CalSTRS as the administrator. The benefit terms of the plan may be amended through legislation. CalSTRS issues a publicly available financial report that can be obtained at [https://www.calstrs.com](https://www.calstrs.com).

**Benefits Provided:** The STRP Defined Benefit Program has two benefit formulas:

- **CalSTRS 2% at 60:** Members first hired on or before December 31, 2012, to perform service that could be creditable to CalSTRS.
- **CalSTRS 2% at 62:** Members first hired on or after January 1, 2013, to perform service that could be creditable to CalSTRS.

The Defined Benefit (DB) Program provides retirement benefits based on members' final compensation, age and years of service credit. In addition, the retirement program provides benefits to members upon disability and to survivors/beneficiaries upon the death of eligible members. There are several differences between the two benefit formulas which are noted below.

**CalSTRS 2% at 60** - CalSTRS 2% at 60 members are eligible for normal retirement at age 60, with a minimum of five years of credited service. The normal retirement benefit is equal to 2.0 percent of final compensation for each year of credited service. Early retirement options are available at age 55 with five years of credited service or as early as age 50 with 30 years of credited service. The age factor for retirements after age 60 increases with each quarter year of age to 2.4 percent at age 63 or older. Members who have 30 years or more of credited service receive an additional increase of up to 0.2 percent to the age factor, up to the 2.4 percent maximum.

CalSTRS calculates retirement benefits based on a one-year final compensation for members who retired on or after January 1, 2001, with 25 or more years of credited service, or for classroom teachers with less than 25 years of credited service if the employer elected to pay the additional benefit cost prior to January 1, 2014. One-year final compensation means a member's highest average annual compensation earnable for 12 consecutive months calculated by taking the creditable compensation that a member could earn in a school year while employed on a full-time basis, for a position in which the person worked. For members with less than 25 years of credited service, final compensation is the highest average annual compensation earnable for any 36 consecutive months of credited service.

**CalSTRS 2% at 62** - CalSTRS 2% at 62 members are eligible for normal retirement at age 62, with a minimum of five years of credited service. The normal retirement benefit is equal to 2.0 percent of final compensation for each year of credited service. An early retirement option is available at age 55. The age factor for retirement after age 62 increases with each quarter year of age to 2.4 percent at age 65 or older.

All CalSTRS 2% at 62 members have their final compensation based on their highest average annual compensation earnable for any 36 consecutive months of credited service.

NOTE 8 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – STATE TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT PLAN (Continued)

Contributions: Required member, employer and state contribution rates are set by the California Legislature and Governor and detailed in Teachers' Retirement Law. Current contribution rates were established by California Assembly Bill 1469 (CalSTRS Funding Plan), which was passed into law in June 2014, and established a schedule of contribution rate increases shared among members, employers, and the State of California to bring CalSTRS toward full funding by 2046. Under the CalSTRS Funding Plan, authority to adjust contribution rates annually within approved ranges was delegated to the Board of CalSTRS.

A summary of statutory contribution rates and other sources of contributions to the DB Program pursuant to the CalSTRS Funding Plan, are as follows:

Members - Under CalSTRS 2% at 60, the member contribution rate was 10.250 percent of applicable member earnings for fiscal year 2022-23.

Under CalSTRS 2% at 62, members pay 9% toward the normal cost and an additional 1.205 percent as per the CalSTRS Funding Plan for a total member contribution rate of 10.205 percent. The contribution rate for CalSTRS 2% at 62 members is adjusted if the normal cost increases or decreases by more than 1% since the last time the member contribution rate was set. Based on the June 30, 2022, valuation adopted by the CalSTRS board in May 2023, the increase in normal cost was less than 1 percent. Therefore, the contribution rate for CalSTRS 2% at 62 members did not change effective July 1, 2023.

Employers - Employers are required to contribute a base contribution rate in statute at 8.25%. Pursuant to the CalSTRS Funding Plan, employers also have a supplemental contribution rate to eliminate their share of the CalSTRS unfunded actuarial obligation by 2046.

The CalSTRS Funding Plan authorizes the CalSTRS board to adjust the employer supplemental contribution rate up or down by a maximum of 1% for a total rate of no higher than 20.25% and no lower than 8.25%. In May 2023, the CalSTRS board voted to keep the employer supplemental contribution rate at 10.85% for fiscal year 2023-24 for a total employer contribution rate of 19.10%.

The CalSTRS employer contribution rates effective for fiscal year 2023-24 through fiscal year 2046-47 are summarized in the table below:

| Effective Date | Base Rate | Supplemental Rate Per CalSTRS Funding Plan | Total |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|-------|
| July 1, 2023   | 8.250%    | 10.850%                                    | 19.100% |
| July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2046 | 8.250% | (1) | (1) |
| July 1, 2046   | 8.250%    | Increase from AB 1469 rate ends in 2046-47 |       |

(1) The CalSTRS Funding Plan authorizes the board to adjust the employer contribution rate up or down by up to 1% each year, but no higher than 20.250% total and no lower than 8.250%.

The District contributed $47,193,088 to the plan for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.

State – The state is required to contribute 10.828 percent of the members’ creditable compensation from the two fiscal years prior.

The state is required to contribute a base contribution rate set in statute at 2.017%. Pursuant to the CalSTRS Funding Plan, the state also has a supplemental contribution rate, which the board can increase by up to 0.5% each fiscal year to help eliminate the state’s share of the CalSTRS unfunded actuarial obligation by 2046. In May 2023, the CalSTRS board voted to keep the state supplemental contribution rate at 6.311% for fiscal year 2022-23 for a total contribution rate of 10.828%.

The CalSTRS state contribution rates effective for fiscal year 2023-24 and beyond are summarized in the table below.

**NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**  
**June 30, 2024**

**NOTE 8 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – STATE TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT PLAN (Continued)**

**Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions**

At June 30, 2024, the District reported a liability for its proportionate share of the net pension liability that reflected a reduction for State pension support provided to the District. The amount recognized by the District as its proportionate share of the net pension liability, the related State support, and the total portion of the net pension liability that was associated with the District were as follows:

| Description                                                                 | Amount          |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability                 | $ 284,800,000   |
| State’s proportionate share of the net pension liability associated with the District | $ 136,458,000   |
| **Total**                                                                   | **$ 421,258,000** |

The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2023 and the total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022. The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on the District’s share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the contributions of all participating school districts and the State. At June 30, 2024, the District’s proportion was 0.374 percent, which was an increase of 0.032 percent from its proportion as of June 30, 2023.

For the year ended June 30, 2024, the District recognized pension expense of $57,968,479 and revenue of $20,486,399 for support provided by the State. At June 30, 2024, the District reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions from the following sources:

| Deferred Outflows of Resources | Deferred Inflows of Resources |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Difference between expected and actual experience | $ 22,381,000 | $ 15,238,000 |
| Changes of assumptions         | $ 1,649,000  | -                             |
| Net differences between projected and actual earnings on investments | $ 1,219,000  | -                             |
| Changes in proportion and differences between District contributions and proportionate share of contributions | $ 36,877,000 | $ 33,928,000 |
| Contributions made subsequent to measurement date | $ 47,193,088 | -                             |
| **Total**                     | **$ 109,319,088** | **$ 49,166,000** |

**NOTE 8 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – STATE TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT PLAN (Continued)**

$47,193,088 reported as deferred outflows of resources related to pensions resulting from contributions subsequent to the measurement date will be recognized as a reduction of the net pension liability in the year ended June 30, 2025. Other amounts reported as deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions will be recognized in pension expense as follows:

**Year Ending**  
**June 30,**  
- 2025: $ (11,270,650)  
- 2026: $ (18,639,650)  
- 2027: $ 23,011,350  
- 2028: $ 3,645,017  
- 2029: $ 9,058,266  
- 2030: $ 7,155,667  

Differences between expected and actual experience and changes in assumptions are amortized over a closed period equal to the average remaining service life of plan members, which is 7 years as of the June 30, 2023 measurement date. Deferred outflows and inflows related to differences between projected and actual earnings on plan investments are netted and amortized over a closed 5-year period.

**Actuarial Methods and Assumptions:** The total pension liability for the STRP was determined by applying update procedures to the actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022, and rolling forward the total pension liability to June 30, 2023. The actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022, used the following actuarial methods and assumptions, applied to all prior periods included in the measurement:

- **Valuation Date:** June 30, 2022  
- **Experience Study:** July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2018  
- **Actuarial Cost Method:** Entry age normal  
- **Investment Rate of Return:** 7.10%  
- **Consumer Price Inflation:** 2.75%  
- **Wage Growth:** 3.50%  
- **Post-retirement Benefit Increases:** 2.00% simple for DB, maintain 85% purchasing power level for DB  

**Discount Rate:** The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.10 percent, which was unchanged from the prior fiscal year. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from plan members and employers will be made at statutory contribution rates in accordance with the rate increase per AB 1469. Projected inflows from investment earnings were calculated using the long-term assumed investment rate of return (7.10 percent) and assuming that contributions, benefit payments, and administrative expense occur midyear. Based on those assumptions, the STRP's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments to current plan members. Therefore, the long-term assumed investment rate of return was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.

NOTE 8 - NET PENSION LIABILITY - STATE TEACHERS' RETIREMENT PLAN (Continued)

Mortality: CalSTRS uses a generational mortality assumption, which involves the use of a base mortality table and projection scales to reflect expected annual reductions in mortality rates at each age, resulting in increases in life expectancies each year into the future. The base mortality tables are CalSTRS custom tables derived to best fit the patterns of mortality among its members. The projection scale was set equal to 110 percent of the ultimate improvement factor from the Mortality Improvement Scale (MP-2019) table, issued by the Society of Actuaries.

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. The best estimate ranges were developed using capital market assumptions from CalSTRS investment staff and investment consultants as inputs to the process.

The actuarial investment rate of return assumption was adopted by the CalSTRS board in January 2020 in conjunction with the most recent experience study. For each current and future valuation, CalSTRS consulting actuary reviews the return assumption for reasonableness based on the most current capital market assumptions. Best estimates of 20-year geometric real rates of return and the assumed asset allocation for each major asset class used as input to develop the actuarial investment rate of return are summarized in the following table:

| Asset Class          | Assumed Asset Allocation | Long-Term* Expected Real Rate of Return |
|---------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Public Equity       | 38%                     | 5.25%                                   |
| Real Estate         | 15%                     | 4.05%                                   |
| Private Equity      | 14%                     | 6.75%                                   |
| Fixed Income        | 14%                     | 2.45%                                   |

NOTE 9 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – PUBLIC EMPLOYER’S RETIREMENT FUND B

General Information about the Public Employer’s Retirement Fund B

Plan Description: The schools’ cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan Public Employer’s Retirement Fund B (PERF B) is administered by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). Plan membership consists of non-teaching and non-certified employees of public schools (K-12), community college districts, offices of education, charter and private schools (elective) in the State of California.

The Plan was established to provide retirement, death and disability benefits to non-teaching and non-certified employees in schools. The benefit provisions for Plan employees are established by statute. CalPERS issues a publicly available financial report that can be obtained at: https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/forms-publications/acfr-2023.pdf.

Benefits Provided: The benefits for the defined benefit plans are based on members’ years of service, age, final compensation, and benefit formula. Benefits are provided for disability, death, and survivors of eligible members or beneficiaries. Members become fully vested in their retirement benefits earned for date after five years (10 years for State Second Tier members) of credited service.

Contributions: The benefits for the defined benefit pension plans are funded by contributions from members and employers, and earnings from investments. Member and employer contributions are a percentage of applicable member compensation. Member contribution rates are defined by law and depend on the respective employer’s benefit formulas. Employer contribution rates are determined by periodic actuarial valuations performed by state actuaries. Actual contributions vary among employer groups of each employer. Employer contributions, including lump sum contributions made when districts first join PERF B, are credited with a market value adjustment in determining contribution rates.

The required contribution rates of most active plan members are based on a percentage of salary in excess of a base compensation amount ranging from zero dollars to $863 monthly.

Required contribution rates for active plan members and employers as a percentage of payroll for the year ended June 30, 2024 were as follows:

Members - The member contribution rate was 7.0 percent of applicable member earnings for fiscal year 2022-23.

Employers - The employer contribution rate was 26.68 percent of applicable member earnings.

The District contributed $29,890,451 to the plan for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.

Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions

At June 30, 2024, the District reported a liability of $213,803,000 for its proportionate share of the net pension liability. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2023 and the total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022. The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on the District’s share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the contributions of all participating school districts. At June 30, 2024, the District’s proportion was 0.591 percent, which was an increase of 0.028 percent from its proportion as of June 30, 2023.

| Contributions made subsequent to measurement date | 29,890,451 | - |
| **Total** | **$ 81,030,451** | **$ 5,025,000** |

$29,890,451 reported as deferred outflows of resources related to pensions resulting from contributions subsequent to the measurement date will be recognized as a reduction of the net pension liability in the year ended June 30, 2025. Other amounts reported as deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions will be recognized in pension expense as follows:

**Year Ending June 30,**

| Year | Amount |
|------|--------|
| 2025 | $ 12,711,250 |
| 2026 | $ 12,804,250 |
| 2027 | $ 19,888,750 |
| 2028 | $ 710,750 |

Differences between expected and actual experience, changes in assumptions and changes in proportion and differences between District contributions and proportionate share of contributions are amortized over a closed period equal to the expected average remaining service life of plan members, which was 3.8 years as of the June 30, 2023 measurement date. Deferred outflows and inflows related to differences between projected and actual earnings on plan investments are netted and amortized over a closed 5-year period.

NOTE 9 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – PUBLIC EMPLOYER’S RETIREMENT FUND B (Continued)

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions: The total pension liability for the Plan was determined by applying update procedures to the actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022, and rolling forward the total pension liability to June 30, 2023. The actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022, used the following actuarial methods and assumptions, applied to all prior periods included in the measurement:

| Valuation Date                     | June 30, 2022                     |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Experience Study                   | June 30, 2000 through June 30, 2019 |
| Actuarial Cost Method              | Entry age normal                   |
| Investment Rate of Return          | 6.90%                              |

| Post-retirement Benefit Increases   | 2.00% until Purchasing Power Allowance<br>Applies, 2.30% thereafter |

The mortality table used was developed based on CalPERS-specific data. The table includes 15 years of mortality improvements using Society of Actuaries 80% of scale MP2020. For more details on this table, please refer to the 2021 experience study report.

All other actuarial assumptions used in the June 30, 2022 valuation were based on the results of an actuarial experience study for the period from 2000 to 2019, including updates to salary increase, mortality and retirement rates. Further details of the Experience Study can be found at CalPERS’ website.

The table below reflects long-term expected real rates of return by assumed asset class. The rate of return was calculated using the capital market assumptions applied to determine the discount rate and asset allocation.

NOTE 9 - NET PENSION LIABILITY - PUBLIC EMPLOYER’S RETIREMENT FUND B (Continued)

**Discount Rate:** The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 6.90 percent. A projection of the expected benefit payments and contributions was performed to determine if assets would run out. The test revealed the assets would not run out. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability for the Plan. The results of the crossover testing for the Plan are presented in a detailed report that can be obtained at CalPERS' website.

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class.

In determining the long-term expected rate of return, CalPERS took into account long-term market return expectations as well as the expected pension fund cash flows. Projected returns for all asset classes are estimated and combined with risk estimates, are used to project compound (geometric) returns over the long term. The discount rate used to discount liabilities was informed by the long-term projected portfolio return.

**Sensitivity of the District’s Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate:** The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability calculated using the discount rate of 6.90 percent, as well as what the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point lower (5.90 percent) or 1-percentage-point higher (7.90 percent) than the current rate:

|  | 1% Decrease (5.90%) | Current Rate (6.90%) | 1% Increase (7.90%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability | $ 309,104,000 | $ 213,803,000 | $ 135,039,000 |

**Pension Plan Fiduciary Net Position:** Detailed information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position is available in the separately issued CalPERS financial report.

NOTE 10 - OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

**Plan Description:** In addition to the pension benefits described in Notes 8 and 9, the District provides post-employment health care benefits (medical and dental) under a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan to all certificated, management and confidential employees who are eligible to retire from the District and have completed a minimum of 5 years of employment with the District. The plan does not issue separate financial statements. Health care benefits are provided for supervisory employees who are eligible to retire under a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan and have completed a minimum of 10 years of employment with the District. Health care benefits are provided to classified and transportation employees, who have reached the age of 55, are eligible to retire under a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan and have completed a minimum of 10 years of employment with the District. Health care benefits are provided to these employees until they have attained the age of 65. As of June 30, 2024 the District has not accumulated assets in a qualified trust for the purpose of paying the benefits related to the District’s Total OPEB Liability.

| Active employees | 4,220 | 3 |
| | 4,760 | 4 |

Benefits Provided: The benefits provided are the same as those provided for active employees. Spouses and dependents of eligible retirees are also eligible for medical coverage. All salaried employees of the District are eligible to receive postemployment health care benefits. Hourly employees (i.e. non-salaried with variable work hours) are not eligible to receive postemployment health care benefits.

Contributions: California Government Code specifies that the District’s contribution requirements for covered employees are established and may be amended by the Governing Board. Retirees participating in the group insurance plans offered by the District are required to contribute 100 percent of the active premiums. In future years, contributions are assumed to increase at the same rate as premiums. The District’s premium rates being charged to these retirees are lower than the expected cost for a retiree population under age 65. Thus, an implicit subsidy exists as a result of this difference between the actual cost and the true retiree cost.

Contributions to the Plan from the District were $6,028,434 for the year ended June 30, 2024. Employees are not required to contribute to the OPEB plan.

Total OPEB Liability

The District’s Total OPEB liability was measured as of June 30, 2023 and was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2022.

Actuarial Assumptions: The total OPEB liability in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement, unless otherwise specified:

| Actuarial Value of Assets | Market Value |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| Mortality                 | CalPERS 2021 Experience Study |
| Discount Rate             | 3.86% based on the Fidelity 20 Year AA Municipal Bond maturity yield index. |
| Retirement Rate           | Retirement rates match rates developed in the most recent experience studies for CalPERS (2021) and CalSTRS (2020) |

The changes in assumptions include a change in the discount rate from 3.69 percent in the prior valuation, to 3.86 percent in the current valuation.

There were no changes between the measurement date and the year ended June 30, 2024 which had a significant effect on the District’s Total OPEB Liability.

### Sensitivity of the Total OPEB Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate

The following presents the Total OPEB Liability of the District, as well as what the District’s Total OPEB Liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is one percentage-point lower or one percentage-point higher than the current discount rate:

**Sensitivity of the Total OPEB Liability to Changes in the Healthcare Cost Trend Rates:** The following presents the Total OPEB Liability of the District, as well as what the District’s Total OPEB Liability would be if it were calculated using healthcare cost trend rates that are one percentage-point lower or one percentage-point higher than the current healthcare cost trend rates:

**OPEB Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to OPEB**

For the year ended June 30, 2024, the District recognized OPEB expense of $6,443,726. At June 30, 2024, the District reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions from the following sources:

| Deferred Outflows of Resources | Deferred Inflows of Resources |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Changes of assumptions          | $ 6,615,029                  | $ 26,490,856             |
| Net differences between projected and actual earnings on investments | $ 614,110                    | $ 15,216,643             |
| Contributions made subsequent to measurement date | $ 6,028,434                  | -                         |
| **Total**                      | $ 13,257,573                 | $ 41,707,499             |

$6,028,434 reported as deferred outflows of resources related to benefits paid subsequent to the measurement date will be recognized as a reduction of the Total OPEB Liability in the year ended June 30, 2025. Other amounts reported as deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB will be recognized in OPEB expense as follows:

| Year Ending June 30, | Amount         |
|-----------------------|----------------|
| 2025                  | $ (4,613,186)  |
| 2026                  | $ (4,603,023)  |
| 2027                  | $ (4,588,203)  |
| 2028                  | $ (4,017,450)  |
| 2029                  | $ (3,721,924)  |
| Thereafter            | $ (12,934,574) |

The effect of changes in assumptions are amortized over a closed period of 10 years as of the June 30, 2023 measurement date.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### June 30, 2024  

### NOTE 11 - JOINT POWERS AGREEMENT (Continued)  
The following is a summary of financial information for School Project for Utility Rate Reduction at June 30, 2023 (the most recent information available):  

- Total assets: $30,991,858  
- Total liabilities: $23,085,492  
- Net position: $7,906,366  
- Total revenues: $100,743,604  
- Total expenses: $98,467,033  

Each member of the JPA has an ongoing financial responsibility in the event of the JPA’s total liabilities exceed its total assets.  

The relationship between San Juan Unified School District and the Joint Powers Authority is such that it is not a component unit of the District for financial reporting purposes. Financial statements for the JPA are available from Schools Insurance Authority.  

### NOTE 12 - CONTINGENCIES  
The District is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the District.  

Also, the District has received state and federal funds for specific purposes that are subject to review or audit by the grantor agencies. Although such audits could generate expenditure disallowances under terms of the grants, it is believed that any required reimbursements will not be material.  

As of June 30, 2024, the District has approximately $139.3 million in outstanding commitments on ongoing construction contracts.

### NOTE 1 - PURPOSE OF SCHEDULES  

**Budgetary Comparison Schedule:** The District employs budget control by object codes and by individual appropriation accounts. Budgets are prepared on the modified accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. The budgets are revised during the year by the Board of Education to provide for revised priorities. Expenditures cannot legally exceed appropriations by major object code. The originally adopted and final revised budgets for the General Fund are presented as Required Supplementary Information. The basis of budgeting is the same as GAAP.  

**Schedule of Changes in Total Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) Liability:** The Schedule of Changes in Total OPEB Liability is presented to illustrate the elements of the District’s Total OPEB Liability. There is a requirement to show information for 10 years. However, until a full 10-year trend is compiled, governments should present information for those years for which information is available. The District has not accumulated assets in a qualified trust for the purpose of paying the benefits related to the District’s Total OPEB Liability.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON STATE COMPLIANCE AND ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE FOR STATE PROGRAMS

**Audit Committee**  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

## Report on Compliance

### Qualified Opinion on State Compliance

We have audited San Juan Unified School District’s (the “District”) compliance with the requirements specified in the State of California 2023-2024 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting applicable to the District’s state program requirements identified below for the year ended June 30, 2024.

In our opinion, except for the noncompliance described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section of our report, the District complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements that are applicable to the laws and regulations of the state programs noted in the table below for the year ended June 30, 2024.

### Basis for Qualified Opinion on State Compliance

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS), the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Government Auditing Standards), and the 2023-2024 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Our responsibilities under those standards and the 2023-2024 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.

We are required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to below.

### Matters Giving Rise to Qualified Opinion on State Compliance

As described in the accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs as items 2024-001 and 2024-002, the District did not comply with requirements regarding Attendance Reporting and Independent Study, respectively. Compliance with such requirements is necessary, in our opinion, for the District to comply with the requirements applicable to those programs.

### Responsibilities of Management for Compliance

Management is responsible for complying with the requirements noted in the table below and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the District’s state programs.
<!-- Page 146 -->
# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements noted in the table below occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the District's compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2023-2024 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting will always detect a material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements noted in the table below is considered material, if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the District's compliance with the requirements of the state programs as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2023-2024 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the District's compliance with the compliance requirements referred to below and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.
- Obtain an understanding of the District’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on an internal control over compliance in accordance with the 2023-2024 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal controls over compliance. Rather, we express no such opinion.
- Select and test transactions and records to determine the District’s compliance with the state laws and regulations applicable to the following items:

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of San Juan Unified School District as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise San Juan Unified School District’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated December 11, 2024.

## Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered San Juan Unified School District’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of San Juan Unified School District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of San Juan Unified School District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that have not been identified.

**Report on Compliance and Other Matters**

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether San Juan Unified School District’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Purpose of this Report**

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR THE FIRST 5 SACRAMENTO COUNTY PROGRAM AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH A PROGRAM-SPECIFIC AUDIT

Audit Committee  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

Report on Compliance  

**Opinion on First 5 Sacramento County Program**  

We have audited San Juan Unified School District’s compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the Program Guidelines for the First 5 Sacramento County Program that have a direct and material effect on the First 5 Sacramento County Program for the year ended June 30, 2024.  

In our opinion, San Juan Unified School District complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on its First 5 Sacramento County Program for the year ended June 30, 2024.  

**Responsibilities of Management for Compliance**  

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the First 5 Sacramento County Program.  

**Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance**  

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the District’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the First 5 Sacramento County Program Guidelines will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the District’s compliance with the requirements of the government program as a whole.

(Continued)

<!-- Page 152 -->
In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the First 5 Sacramento County Program Guidelines, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the District’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
- Obtain an understanding of the District’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the First 5 Sacramento County Program Guidelines, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District’s internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit.

**Report on Internal Control Over Compliance**

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of the First 5 Sacramento County Program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of the First 5 Sacramento County Program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of the First 5 Sacramento County Program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. We did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of First 5 Sacramento County Program Guidelines. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM; REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AS REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE

**Crowe LLP**  
Independent Member Crowe Global  

**Audit Committee**  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

## Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program

### Opinion on Each Major Federal Program

We have audited San Juan Unified School District’s compliance with the types of compliance requirements identified as subject to audit in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of San Juan Unified School District’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2024. San Juan Unified School District’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.

In our opinion, San Juan Unified School District complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2024.

### Basis for Opinion on Each Major Federal Program

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS); the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Government Auditing Standards); and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Our responsibilities under those standards and the Uniform Guidance are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.

We are required to be independent of San Juan Unified School District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of San Juan Unified School District’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.

### Responsibilities of Management for Compliance

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to San Juan Unified School District’s federal programs.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on San Juan Unified School District's compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material, if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about San Juan Unified School District's compliance with the requirements of each major federal program as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance, we

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding San Juan Unified School District’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
- Obtain an understanding of San Juan Unified School District’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of San Juan Unified School District’s internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit.

## Report on Internal Control Over Compliance

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

### SECTION IV - STATE AWARD FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS

**2024-001 DEFICIENCY – STATE COMPLIANCE – ATTENDANCE REPORTING (10000)**

**Criteria:** Attendance Accounting and Reporting in California Public Schools, Title 5, CCR, Section 401 and 421 (b) and Education Code Section 44809 – Each LEA must develop and maintain accurate and adequate records to support the attendance reported to the State.

**Condition:** While performing absence testing we noted for three school sites one student at each site selected for absence note testing was marked absent in the log/notes but was marked present in the attendance report for a total of 6 days claimed in error.

**Context:** We performed the audit procedure enumerated in the State of California 2023-24 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting and identified the finding described above.

**Effect:** The District is not in compliance with Attendance Reporting requirements for the year ended June 30, 2024.

**Cause:** The school site did not establish and follow adequate internal control procedures.

**Fiscal Impact:** Fiscal impact was not calculated as the total ADA impact was less than 0.5.

**Repeat Finding:** Yes. See Finding 2023-002.

**Recommendation:** We recommend that the District ensure that each school site implements and adheres to internal controls to ensure the accuracy of ADA reported.

**Views of responsible officials and planned corrective actions:** The District will ensure that each school site implements and adheres to internal controls to ensure the accuracy of ADA reported by incorporating professional learning on accurate reporting through the regularly scheduled classified meetings, including school site office staff responsible for attendance and reporting.

**2024-002 DEFICIENCY – STATE COMPLIANCE – INDEPENDENT STUDY (40000)**

**Criteria:** Pursuant to Education Code Section 51747, no days of attendance are to be reported for students without signed independent study agreements in place with all required criteria. Further, the District is required to maintain work samples from students enrolled in independent study for which attendance is claimed.

**Condition:** While performing independent study procedures Crowe inspected the agreement and supporting documents for selected students and noted for one student the site was unable to locate the contract or work samples. Crowe also noted for seven selected students contracts, the number of course credits to be earned was not included in the written agreement.

**Context:** We performed the audit procedure enumerated in the State of California 2023-24 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting and identified the finding described above.

**Effect:** The District is not in compliance with Independent Study requirements for the year ended June 30, 2024.

**Cause:** The District claimed attendance for students without proper independent study agreements and evidence of work. The school site did not establish and follow adequate internal control procedures.

**Fiscal Impact:** The effect of this finding is an overstatement of 0.1 ADA in Grade Span 4-6, 0.41 ADA in Grade Span 7-8, and 0.09 ADA in Grade Span 9-12, or approximately $7,323.

**Repeat Finding:** Yes. See Finding 2023-003.

**Recommendation:** We recommend that the District ensure that each school site implements and adheres to internal controls to ensure the accuracy of ADA reported.

**Views of responsible officials and planned corrective actions:** The District will ensure that independent study agreements contain all necessary elements, and they are saved properly. Additional reminders to staff of the importance of saving the agreements and evidence of work will be sent out. Sites will be asked to conduct spot checking of agreements and evidence of work files.

2023-001 MATERIAL WEAKNESS – INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (30000)  

**Condition:** During the year ended June 30, 2023, the Cash in County Treasury account reconciliation for Fund 51 was not prepared in a timely or complete manner. This resulted in an overstatement of the cash balance presented for audit by $26,905,548. A material adjusting entry was necessary to correctly report the Cash in County Treasury balance in the audited financial statements.  

**Recommendation:** The District’s management team should implement necessary internal controls to ensure the accuracy of financial reporting. As part of the monthly and/or annual financial close, a reconciliation of general ledger accounts should be performed to ensure accurate financial reporting.

**2023-003 DEFICIENCY – STATE COMPLIANCE – INDEPENDENT STUDY (40000)**

**Condition:** For 8 of the students selected for testing of independent study, attendance was claimed for students where the agreements were not signed within the appropriate timeline to allow for the claiming of apportionment.

# OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTION

## FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

The San Juan Unified School District financial status is comprised of three major components: (1) Fund Balance (Ending and Beginning Balance); (2) Revenues; and (3) Expenditures. Estimates in the First Interim Report are based on actual activity through October 31, 2024. The district certifies this report as Positive. The Second Interim Report will be presented in March 2025.

## MISSION

We partner with our San Juan Unified community in setting high expectations for academic achievement rooted in equity and unity to create supportive learning experiences in which all students, families and staff can excel and thrive.

## CORE VALUES

- **Belonging**  
  We create a community that cultivates welcoming and inclusive environments with genuine respect for our diversity of cultures, identities and abilities.

- **Relevance**  
  We design experiences and environments where each learner can explore and apply skills and knowledge that align with evolving careers and workplaces.

- **Voice**  
  We honor and affirm all voices of our school community and encourage them to share their perspectives to help improve and shape what we do and how we do it.

- **Social and Emotional Intelligence**  
  We build a culture that teaches, models and applies social and emotional intelligence in all interactions with each other.

- **Resilience**  
  We create nurturing schools and programs that inspire each learner to continue to persevere, gain strength and develop the confidence to excel beyond challenges.

- **Championing**  
  We support and advocate for those in our San Juan Unified community who are disproportionately impacted or marginalized by circumstances beyond their control.

- **Innovation**  
  We embrace and encourage creative thinking and learning environments that transform ideas into actionable solutions.

# CORE COMMITMENTS

- Prioritize resources to close opportunity gaps, improve teaching and learning, recruit and retain high-quality employees, and help all students reach their potential.

- Provide sound fiscal stewardship of community resources.

- Build trust by sharing useful, transparent fiscal information.

- Adopt a budget that consistently balances ongoing revenues and expenditures to avoid a structural deficit.

# CORE MESSAGES

- The state continues to receive modestly good news in the first half of its 2024-25 budget year, with revenues coming in higher than expected. Despite the good news, the Legislative Analyst's Office estimates the state will face a $2 billion deficit in 2025-26. Fortunately, it does not appear that K-12 education spending will be reduced, and the LCFF COLA will be funded in 2025-26.

- The 2025-26 COLA shows a slight downward trend towards 2%. This projection is based on five out of the eight data points used to calculate the statutory COLA. The Legislative Analyst's Office estimated a 25-26 COLA of 2.46%, but this estimate came too late in time for the district’s first interim report, which uses 2%.

- LEAs face near and long-term challenges, including risks to the state revenue forecast, reduced ADA because of COVID-19-related student absences, cost pressures (e.g., pension rate increases), expiring one-time COVID-19 relief funds, and declining enrollment. San Juan Unified is unique and has seen a large increase in its enrollment of 1,000 new students compared to last school year.

- The district will continue to exercise caution and flexibility in long-term fiscal planning. The budget will support ongoing expenditures with ongoing revenues and meet the requirements of a positive certification.

![2024-27 Multi-Year Projections](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=2024-27+Multi-Year+Projections)

## 2024-27 MULTI-YEAR PROJECTIONS

The district primarily uses the Department of Finance (DOF) estimates to project LCFF revenue growth in 2024-25 through 2026-27. The district’s Fiscal Services team estimates enrollment based on historical trends and current data, which are used to calculate Average Daily Attendance (ADA), the basis of state funding. Operating costs for future years are projected using historical patterns, statistical probabilities, and the estimated California Consumer Price Index. Significant expenditure assumptions include salaries, seniority and retirement of employees, healthcare and other benefit costs, public pension plans (STRS and PERS), utilities, property, and liability insurance.

### PLANNING FACTORS

The district used the following planning factors to build 2024-25, 2025-26, and 2026-27 budget projections.

## Part I - General Administrative Share of Plant Services Costs
California's indirect cost plan allows that the general administrative costs in the indirect cost pool may include that portion of plant services costs (maintenance and operations costs and facilities rents and leases costs) attributable to the general administrative offices. The calculation of the plant services costs attributed to general administration and included in the pool is standardized and automated using the percentage of salaries and benefits relating to general administration as proxy for the percentage of space occupied by general administration.

### A. Salaries and Benefits - Other General Administration and Centralized Data Processing
1. Salaries and benefits paid through payroll (Funds 01, 09, and 62, objects 1000-3999 except 3701-3702)  
   (Functions 7200-7700, goals 0000 and 9000)  
   **40,648,420.00**

2. Contracted general administrative positions not paid through payroll  
   a. Enter the costs, if any, of general administrative positions performing services ON SITE but paid through a contract, rather than through payroll in functions 7200-7700, goals 0000 and 9000, Object 5800.  
   b. If an amount is entered on Line A2a, provide the title, duties, and approximate FTE of each general administrative position paid through a contract. Retain supporting documentation in case of audit.

### B. Salaries and Benefits - All Other Activities
1. Salaries and benefits paid through payroll (Funds 01, 09, and 62, objects 1000-3999 except 3701-3702)  
   (Functions 1000-6999, 7100-7480, & 8100-8400; Functions 7200-7700, all goals except 0000 & 9000)  
   **580,830,382.00**

### C. Percentage of Plant Services Costs Attributable to General Administration  
(Line A1 plus Line B1; zero if negative) (See Part III, Lines A5 and A6)  
**7.00%**

## Part II - Adjustments for Employment Separation Costs
When an employee separates from service, the local educational agency (LEA) may incur costs associated with the separation in addition to the employee's salary for the normal pay period. These additional costs can be categorized as "normal" or "abnormal" or mass* separation costs.

Normal separation costs include items such as pay for accumulated unused leave or routine severance pay authorized by governing board policy. Normal separation costs are not allowable as direct costs to federal programs, but are allowable as indirect costs. State programs may have similar restrictions. Where federal or state program guidelines required that the LEA charge an employee's normal separation costs to an unrestricted resource rather than to the restricted program in which the employee worked, the LEA may identify and enter these costs on Line A for inclusion in the indirect cost pool.

Abnormal or mass separation costs are those costs resulting from actions taken by an LEA to influence employees to terminate their employment earlier than they normally would have. Abnormal or mass separation costs include retirement incentives such as Golden Handshakes or severance packages negotiated to effect termination. Abnormal or mass separation costs may not be charged to federal programs as other direct costs or indirect costs. Where an LEA paid abnormal or mass separation costs on behalf of positions in general administrative functions included in the indirect cost pool, the LEA must identify and enter these costs on Line B for exclusion from the pool.

### A. Normal Separation Costs (optional)  
Enter any normal separation costs paid on behalf of employees of restricted state or federal programs that were charged to an unrestricted resource (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 1000-6999 or 8100-8400 rather than to the restricted program. These costs will be moved in Part III from base costs to the indirect cost pool. Retain supporting documentation.

### B. Abnormal or Mass Separation Costs (required)  
Enter any abnormal or mass separation costs paid on behalf of general administrative positions charged to unrestricted resources (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 7200-7700. These costs will be moved in Part III from the indirect cost pool to base costs. If none, enter zero.

**E. Optional allocation of negative carry-forward adjustment over more than one year**  
Where a negative carry-forward adjustment causes the proposed approved rate to fall below zero or would reduce the rate at which the LEA could recover indirect costs to such an extent that it would cause the LEA significant fiscal harm, the LEA may request the carry-forward adjustment be allocated over more than one year. Where allocation of a negative carry-forward adjustment over more than one year does not resolve a negative rate, the CDE will work with the LEA on a case-by-case basis to establish an approved rate.  
1. Preliminary proposed approved rate (Part III, Line D) if negative carry-forward adjustment is deferred:  
not applicable  
Option 2. Preliminary proposed approved rate (Part III, Line D) if one-half of negative carry-forward adjustment is deferred to one or more future years:  
not applicable  
Option 3. Preliminary proposed approved rate (Part III, Line D) if one-third of negative carry-forward adjustment is applied to the current year calculation and the remainder is deferred to one or more future years:

|----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Federal Revenue (Fund 01, Objects 8100-8299) (Form MYPI, Line A2)** | | | | |
| Current Year (2024-25) | 40,337,945.00 | 46,261,204.00 | 14.0% | Yes |
| 1st Subsequent Year (2025-26) | 36,074,129.00 | 35,496,112.00 | 1.2% | No |
| 2nd Subsequent Year (2026-27) | 33,840,283.00 | 35,296,845.00 | 4.3% | No |
| **Explanation:** | | | | |
| (required / Yes) | The increase is due to budgeting for the carry over of COVID related resources that are being spent out in 2024-25, Title I reduction in current year and less carry over, carry over in Title II, III and IV grants as well as McKinney Vento and Refugee School Impact. | | | |

| **Other State Revenue (Fund 01, Objects 8300-8599) (Form MYPI, Line A2)** | | | | |
| Current Year (2024-25) | 13,527,315.00 | 110,210,726.00 | -2.9% | No |

| 2nd Subsequent Year (2026-27) | 9,515,892.00 | 12,725,132.00 | 20.0% | Yes |
| **Explanation:** | | | | |
| (required / Yes) | The increase in all years over the adopted budget estimates is mainly attributed to an expected rise in interest income, adjustments to Charter Oversight Fees, and adjustments in revenues from Wireless Recycling Towers, Aladar Academy, and Commissions on Teacher Credentialing Classified grants due to lower participation. Additionally, a higher STRS excess revenue contributes to the increase. For the 2024-25 year only, the increase also includes additional local grants and donation revenue recognized as received. | | | |

| **Books and Supplies (Fund 01, Objects 4000-4999) (Form MYPI, Line B4)** | | | | |
| Current Year (2024-25) | 31,896,527.00 | 36,073,213.00 | 13.2% | Yes |

| 2nd Subsequent Year (2026-27) | 27,509,223.00 | 22,186,091.00 | -19.3% | Yes |
| **Explanation:** | | | | |
| (required / Yes) | The increase in 2024-25 is due to aligning budgets to current year spending plans, budgeting for carry over for ASEs, the Art, Music and Higher textbook adoption Block grant, the Art, Music in Schools Prop 28 grant, the spending out of COVID related resources, and a reduction of carry over and transfer to the Media Pending in Career Technical Education Investment grant, reduced spending on textbooks and increased spending in the Art, Music in Schools Prop 28 grant, the Literacy Coaches & Reading Specialists Grant Program and Med-Cal Administrative funds. | | | |

| **Services and Other Operating Expenditures (Fund 01, Objects 5000-5999) (Form MYPI, Line B5)** | | | | |
| Current Year (2024-25) | 63,730,838.00 | 68,087,574.00 | 6.8% | Yes |
| 1st Subsequent Year (2025-26) | 52,542,360.00 | 56,816,746.00 | 4.4% | No |
| 2nd Subsequent Year (2026-27) | 47,454,250.00 | 56,974,370.00 | 8.6% | Yes |
| **Explanation:** | | | | |
| (required / Yes) | The net increase in services in 2024-25 is due to budgeting for carry over, aligning budgets to current year spending plans, a reduction in resident grant participants, and for one-time grants and donations expense not included in the adopted budget. | | | |

### 6C. Comparison of District Total Operating Revenues and Expenditures to the Standard Percentage Range

**DATA ENTRY:** Explanations are linked from Section 6A if the status in Section 6B is Not Met; no entry is allowed below.

1a. **STANDARD NOT MET** - One or more projected operating revenues have changed since budget adoption by more than the standard in one or more of the current year or two subsequent fiscal years. Reasons for the projected change, descriptions of the methods and assumptions used in the projections, and what changes, if any, will be made to bring the projected operating revenues within the standard must be entered in Section 6A above and will also display in the explanation box below.

**Explanation:**  
- Federal Rev. Source  
  (linked from 6A if NOT met)  

**Explanation:**  
- Other State Revenue  
  (linked from 6A if NOT met)  
  The net increase in all years over the adopted budget estimates is mainly attributed to an expected rise in interest income, adjustments to Charter Oversight Fees, and adjustments in revenues from Wireless Recovering Towers, Alder Academy, and commissions on Teacher Credentialing Classified grants due to lower participation. Additionally, a higher STRS excess refund contributes to the increase. For the 2024-25 year only, the increase also includes additional local grants and donation revenue recognized as received.

1b. **STANDARD NOT MET** - One or more total operating expenditures have changed since budget adoption by more than the standard in one or more of the current year or two subsequent fiscal years. Reasons for the projected change, descriptions of the methods and assumptions used in the projections, and what changes, if any, will be made to bring the projected operating revenues within the standard must be entered in Section 6A above and will also display in the explanation box below.

**Explanation:**  
- Books and Supplies  
  (linked from 6A if NOT met)  
  The increase in 2024-25 is due to aligning budgets to current year spending plans, budgeting for carry over for ASSETS, the Art, Music and Instructional Materials Discretionary Block grant, the Art, Music in Schools Prop 28 grant, the spending out of COVID related resources, and higher textbook adoption costs. The net reduction in the out years over the adopted budget estimates is due to spending out carry over and a reduction of award for Title I, reduced spending in Career Technical Education Incentive grant, reduced spending on textbooks and increased spending in the Art, Music in Schools Prop 28 grant, the Literacy Coaches & Reading Specialists Grant Program and Med-Cal Administrative funds.

**Explanation:**  
- Services and Other Expend.  
  (linked from 6A if NOT met)  
  The net increase in services in 2024-25 is due to budgeting for carry over, aligning budgets to current year spending plans, a reduction in resident grant participants, and for one-time grants and donations expense not included in the adopted budget.

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Public Hearing/Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board hold a public hearing and approve the Visions In Education Charter School Renewal Petition for a term of five years starting July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2030. The term for this charter will expire on June 30, 2025, unless approved for renewal by the Board of Education.

The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and Visions In Education Charter School has provided all necessary information, additions and/or changes as requested during the review.  

An MOU agreement will continue to define the specific financial and operational relationship between Visions In Education and the district and resolve other matters of mutual interest not otherwise contained within the terms of each charter petition.

# FINDINGS OF FACT AND RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING CHARTER PETITION RENEWAL FOR VISIONS IN EDUCATION CHARTER SCHOOL OCTOBER 31, 2024

## INTRODUCTION

On September 19, 2024, Visions in Education charter school (“VIE”) submitted a charter school renewal petition to the San Juan Unified School District (“district”). This renewal petition was submitted for a five-year term starting July 1, 2025, and continuing through June 30, 2030. VIE is an independent charter school authorized by the district since 2018. VIE serves students in grades TK-12.

The Board of Education held a public hearing on October 22, 2024, to hear from the petitioners and consider the level of support for the petition. The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and VIE has provided all necessary information, additions, and/or changes requested during the review process. Under new state law (AB 1505) resulting in Education Code section 47605(b), district staff recommendations, including the recommended findings, will be published 15 days prior to the public hearing at which the Board of Education will take action to either grant or deny the charter renewal petition.

## APPLICABLE LAW

Education Code section 47607, subdivision (b) states that “[r]enewals and material revisions of charters are governed by the standards and criteria described in 47605, and shall include, but not be limited to, a reasonably comprehensive description of any new requirement of charter schools enacted into law after the charter was originally granted or last renewed.” The Board of Education may deny a renewal petition if the charter school fails to meet the standard for renewal outlined within the Criteria for Renewal Education Code section 47605. A renewal petition shall not be denied unless the district makes written factual findings that support one or more of the following findings:

1. The charter school presents an unsound educational program for students during the term of its charter. (Education Code section 47605(c)(1).)

2. The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition. (Education Code section 47605(c)(2).)

3. The petition does not contain the necessary affirmations of each of the conditions described in subdivision (e) (Education Code section 47605(c)(4).)

4. The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the 15 required elements set forth in the Charter Schools Act. (Education Code 47605(c)(5).)
<!-- Page 339 -->
(5) The petition does not contain a declaration of whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the exclusive public employer of the employees of the charter school for purposes of Chapter 10.7 (commencing with section 3540) of Division 4 of Title 1 of the Government Code.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF FACT

1. For a charter school’s renewal petition to be approved, it must present a sound educational program for its students, based on the past performance of the charter school. Under Education Code section 47607, a charter authorizer must consider the charter school’s performance on indicators included in the California School Dashboard when evaluating a renewal petition. This renewal process creates four types of renewal:

   a. High Performing Charter Schools  
   b. Middle Performing Charter Schools  
   c. Low Performing Charter Schools  
   d. Dashboard Alternative School Status (DASS)  

A school’s identification as belonging to one of the above tiers is determined by the California Department of Education (“CDE”) based on Dashboard data. The CDE publishes the list of charter schools and their renewal tiers.

Visions in Education meets “Middle Performing Charter School Status” as defined by Education Code Section 47607.2.

When evaluating charter schools that are in this tier, authorizers shall consider schoolwide performance and performance of all subgroups on the Dashboard, and shall provide “greater weight” to performance on measurements of academic performance in determining whether to grant a charter renewal. The authorizer shall also consider clear and convincing evidence, demonstrated by verified data, showing either the school achieved measurable increases in academic achievement, as defined by at least one year’s progress for each year in school, or strong postsecondary outcomes equal to similar peers. In addition, authorizers shall consider “verified data” for renewal of charter schools. According to Education Code section 47607.2(c), “verified data” is defined as “data derived from nationally-recognized, valid, peer-reviewed, and reliable sources that are externally produced,” including postsecondary outcomes.

After analyzing the Dashboard data, the review team found the following results in overall performance level and significant subgroup performance level. (In the renewal petition, charter element “Measurable Student Outcomes”, VIE provides a comparison to San Juan Unified School District and similar schools within San Juan Unified School District). VIE meets the criteria to be considered a Middle Performing Charter School.

![Education Code section 47604.32 identifies the oversight duties of a charter authorizer, including a visit to each charter school at least annually and ensuring that each charter school under its authority complies with all reports required of charter schools by law. In carrying out the oversight duties, the charter authorizer representatives will continue to monitor academic performance through the annual report (informational report due in May of each year - Education Code section 47604.33) and the LCAP and any other reports required by CDE (i.e. Learning Continuity Plan, etc.) in order to verify that the charter school is taking meaningful steps to improve academic performance. During the fall each year, a district representative conducts classroom visitations or virtual classroom visitations at VIE. These visitations, conducted across grade levels, verify the implementation of the educational program outlined in the renewal petition. The representative has observed standards-based lessons in all classrooms, as well as cohesive practices and strategies that reflect and support the school mission and vision. The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and has determined that VIE presents a sound educational program as evidenced by student academic performance and therefore meets this requirement for renewal. 2. For a charter school’s renewal petition to be approved, it must provide evidence that it has the capacity to implement the program set forth in the petition. This includes (but is not limited to) a sound financial and administrative plan, a description of facilities (including location(s) and current and projected availability), etc. The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and has determined that VIE has provided the necessary evidence in the petition to meet this requirement for renewal. 3. For a charter school’s renewal petition to be approved, it must include the necessary affirmations set forth in the Charter Schools Act. (Education Code section 47605(c)(4).) The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and has determined that VIE has provided the necessary affirmations in the petition to meet this requirement for renewal. 4. For a charter school’s renewal petition to be approved, it must contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the 15 required elements set forth in the Charter Schools Act. (Education Code section 47605(c)(5).) The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and has determined that VIE has included reasonably comprehensive descriptions of the 15 required elements set forth in the Charter Schools Act. 3 340](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993)
<!-- Page 341 -->
5. For a charter school’s renewal petition to be approved, it must contain a declaration of whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the exclusive public employer of the employees of the charter school for purposes of Chapter 10.7 (commencing with Section 3540) of Division 4 of Title 1 of the Government Code.

The district’s charter review team has thoroughly studied the charter renewal petition and has determined that VIE has included the appropriate declaration.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

Accordingly, based on the above findings, the district’s charter review team recommends to the superintendent that the renewal petition for Visions in Education charter school be granted for a term of five years, commencing on July 1, 2025, and continuing through June 30, 2030.

Visions is currently interviewing potential Board members to fill the vacant seat on our board. Our Board Member Spotlights are below in Appendix B and can also be found on our website (https://www.viedu.org/governing-board/).

## Section H: Admissions Policies

Visions’ admissions preferences are permissive under state and federal guidelines. As outlined in the petition, our admissions preferences are as follows:

### Admissions Preferences

If the number of applications for admission to a grade or program exceeds the number of available slots, the following admission preferences shall be applied in the priority order as listed below:

1. Existing students of Visions (exempt from public random drawing…)
2. Siblings of students admitted to or attending Visions
3. Children of Visions employees
4. Residents of the District
5. All other applicants

Enrollment preferences are not likely to impact the racial, ethnic and unduplicated pupil balance the charter school strives to reflect, which aligns to the population residing within the territorial jurisdiction of SJUSD, and enrollment data will be reviewed annually to ensure admission preferences do not have an adverse effect on racial/ethnicity and unduplicated pupil balance.

Visions primarily uses its website (viedu.org) as a central platform for prospective students and families to access information about enrollment, Visions’ programs, enrollment timelines, and requirements. The website features a user-friendly “Contact Form” where prospective students and families can submit an interest inquiry with minimal information. Upon submission, all contacts immediately receive digital promotional materials, including an information kit.
<!-- Page 344 -->
![Response to Comments on Charter Petition Evaluation Matrix](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Response+to+Comments+on+Charter+Petition+Evaluation+Matrix)

In addition to the website, Visions employs a range of outreach mediums to inform the community, including radio and print advertisements, Google AdWords campaigns, and advertisements on social media platforms.

Visions is committed to nondiscrimination in all aspects of its operations, as outlined in multiple locations in the petition, as well as in its Board policies and required notices. A nondiscrimination statement is prominently displayed on the website. To further ensure transparency and inclusivity, Visions will audit all marketing and promotional materials to confirm that the statement is included which clearly and prominently states that Visions serves all students.

Visions affirms that its enrollment and educational practices do not discriminate against prospective or current students in any way.

**Section M: Post-employment Rights of Employees**

Former Visions employees seeking to return to SJUSD can do so only by following the processes established by SJUSD, collective bargaining agreements, SJUSD Board policy, state law, and other applicable regulations.

**Financial/Administrative Plan**

Updated cash flow projections, including more details of monthly inflows and outflows showing positive cash balances, are included below in Appendix A.

**Special Education**

Visions acknowledges and affirms that it is responsible for providing special education, instruction, and related services to the students enrolled in Visions regardless of students' district of residence.

When a special education student enrolls, becomes ineligible, or withdraws from Visions, specific procedures are followed to ensure proper notification. Upon enrollment, the district of residence is notified through a records request, which includes any relevant student records such as existing IEPs. Changes in a student’s eligibility status are not directly communicated to the district of residence or the authorizing LEA; instead, this information is reported through CALPADS in compliance with state reporting requirements. In the event of a student’s withdrawal, the district of residence is notified in writing as part of the withdrawal process. These procedures are designed to meet state requirements and maintain clear communication with the district of residence and the authorizing LEA.

![Board of Directors Spotlight: Mark Holman](https://example.com/image.jpg)

**Board of Directors Spotlight: Mark Holman**

Please share why you volunteer on the Board at Visions In Education.

As a successful local CEO who values education and family, volunteering on the Board at Visions In Education allows me to give back to my community while advancing my personal and professional priorities for community development. I’m passionate about ensuring all students have access to high-quality education and personalized learning experiences, and I’m committed to contributing my skills and experiences to support Visions In Education’s mission. Serving on the Board is a fulfilling way for me to combine my dedication to education, family, and public service.

**What is it about Visions that made you want to be part of our school community?**

I was drawn to Visions In Education both because of its commitment to personalized learning and flexibility in education and the potential to impact public education more broadly. I believe every student deserves the opportunity to learn in a way that best suits their needs and goals, and Visions embodies that philosophy. Being part of the Visions school community allows me to contribute to shaping the future of education and making a positive impact on students’ lives.

**How might you describe the difference that our teachers and staff are making by meeting the individual and unique needs of each student?**

The impact of Visions’ teachers and staff in meeting the individual and unique needs of each student is profound. By personalizing education plans and providing one-on-one support, they create a learning environment where every student can thrive. This tailored approach not only drives academic success but also fosters confidence, motivation, and a sense of belonging in each student. By recognizing and accommodating diverse learning styles, interests, and challenges, our teachers and staff empower students to reach their full potential and achieve their goals. Their dedication to meeting students where they are and helping them succeed sets a foundation for lifelong learning and success beyond the classroom. Ultimately, our teachers help students shape their futures and equip them with the skills and confidence to navigate the world with purpose and resilience.

**What is one way that Visions is making a difference in our community from your perspective?**

By offering personalized learning experiences, flexible schedules, and comprehensive support services, Visions ensures that every student has the chance to succeed academically and personally. This commitment to inclusivity and excellence both empowers individual students and also contributes to the overall strength and vitality of our communities. Visions fosters a culture of lifelong learning and empowerment, preparing students to become engaged citizens, future leaders, and positive contributors to our society. Another way Visions contributes is to lead among the broader charter school community. Given our location near the Capitol and our high-quality management, educational, and governance practices, we are able to help the State of California learn new ways to improve public education statewide. Being an incubator of public school innovation was the original intent of the California Charter Schools Act.

As a member of the Board, my role in holding Visions accountable for meeting our goals involves several key responsibilities. First and foremost, I work alongside fellow Board members to establish clear policies and objectives aligned with the school’s mission. This includes regularly reviewing and evaluating the school’s performance metrics and progress towards achieving our goals.

To ensure accountability to stakeholders such as families, staff, and taxpayers, I actively engage in oversight activities, such as monitoring financial stewardship, compliance with regulations, and the effectiveness of educational programs. I participate in regular Board meetings where we discuss strategic initiatives, review data and progress, and address any concerns raised by stakeholders.

Transparency is paramount in accountability, so I advocate for open communication channels between the Board, administration, staff, families, and the community. This includes providing opportunities for stakeholders to give feedback, ask questions, and voice concerns regarding the school’s operations and performance. Listening is critical.

Additionally, I believe in fostering a culture of continuous improvement, where we regularly assess our practices and policies to identify areas for enhancement and ensure alignment with our mission and values. By actively fulfilling my oversight role and promoting accountability measures, I strive to uphold the trust and confidence of all stakeholders in Visions In Education as we work together to fulfill our shared educational goals.

One of the most important jobs I have as Chair is to work with our Superintendent to create a sustainable culture of good governance.

What are you most passionate about? How are you able to pursue that passion by serving on our Board?

I’m passionate about many things, including liberty and innovation. Serving on the Board at Visions In Education allows me to advocate for policies and initiatives that prioritize family involvement in education. By promoting innovation in a well-managed public school environment where teachers and families and other caregivers are valued partners in students’ learning journeys, I can help the State of California create a more enriching and effective educational experience for all students.

Please share a bit about your background, family, and what you like to do in your spare time.

Outside of my professional endeavors, my family is my greatest joy and priority. I’m married to my wonderful wife, Jennifer, and we have a 10-year-old son who keeps us both grounded and inspired. Spending quality time with my family, whether it’s exploring historical sites, cooking together, spending time in the wilderness, playing games, or simply sharing stories around the dinner table, are among the activities I cherish most in life.

In my spare time, I’m deeply interested in history, which ties into my involvement as a former Chairman of the Board of the Patrick Henry Memorial Foundation. Learning about and gaining insight from the past is both a passion and a source of inspiration for me. Additionally, I’m deeply involved in community service and my church, as giving back to others is a core value that drives me in both my personal and professional life.

# Board of Directors Spotlight: Terrence Shelton

**Please share why you volunteer on the Board at Visions In Education.**

Every student that walks across the stage to receive their diploma is a reminder of why I volunteer on this Board. Preparing students for success in a rapidly changing world is a pursuit that never ends. I am here to help create a learning environment that prepares people for these changes, and builds confidence for people to be an active part of those changes.

**What is it about Visions that made you want to be part of our school community?**

Before joining the Board, I’d heard nothing but great things about Visions. A trusted colleague of mine homeschooled her two children at Visions from Kindergarten to 8th grade. Although I didn’t know much about non-classroom based schools at the time, I was amazed at what and how her children were learning and at their student success. Many years later, another colleague told me about an opportunity to join the Board. Now, there were two people I highly regarded saying equally amazing things about the school. After doing my own research, I knew I had to be part of it.

**How might you describe the difference that our teachers and staff are making by meeting the individual and unique needs of each student?**

The people at Visions are all committed to student success. They know that this happens when you focus on not only the academics, but the social and wellbeing aspects of our students’ lives as well. Visions has programs that support the whole student.

**What is one way that Visions is making a difference in our community from your perspective?**

Visions is a leader in this space. We focus on student success, but we also stand in our value of integrity. We do things the right way and without cutting corners. A school leading the way like Visions shows what can be done and how it should be done, setting the example for other schools to follow and influencing policy in support of all students.

**As a member of the Board, you have an important policy and oversight role to ensure the school is achieving its mission. How would you describe your role in holding Visions accountable for meeting our goals to a variety of stakeholders, including families, staff, and taxpayers?**

Challenge, support, and advocate. Challenge the team to innovate, support the team on their decisions, and be an advocate for Visions in my network.

**What are you most passionate about? How are you able to pursue that passion by serving on our Board?**

I'm committed to fostering sustainable communities, particularly by empowering young individuals. My focus lies in enhancing the education system, fostering mentorship opportunities, and ensuring career readiness for youth. Joining the Visions Board perfectly aligns with these passions. Visions offers a pathway to equitable access to top-tier education, characterized by greater flexibility compared to traditional public schools.

Please share a bit about your background, family, and what you like to do in your spare time.

I am a proud husband and father of three. My family is the purpose for everything I do. We like spending family time watching movies, reading, and playing board games. I grew up in a single parent home and some of my best memories are made of moments like those, so I want to create similar moments for them.

Is there anything else you’d like to add?

Visions’ faculty and staff is truly amazing. Their commitment to our students and to each other is evident in every interaction. They empower the people who will change our future for the better and I stand in awe. I'm so proud to be part of this Board.

# Board of Directors Spotlight: Clark Shueh

**Please share why you volunteer on the Board at Visions In Education.**

I am inspired by Visions In Education's Vision, Mission, and Values! Children are our future! I volunteer my time, unique talents, backgrounds, and experiences to advocate for them as a meaningful way to contribute to education, bring about a positive, long-lasting impact, and make a difference in the lives of students and families within the community.

**What is it about Visions that made you want to be part of our school community?**

I met Visions In Education Superintendent Steve Olmos at the San Juan Education Foundation Gala. I learned that Visions is a free, non-classroom-based public charter school that serves over 7,200 TK-12 students in 9 counties. It offers students flexible and personalized service through their Independent Study, University Prep, and Home School programs. I was intrigued and wanted to learn more.

Over the next week, I researched and learned about Visions’ leadership team, teachers, and staff, the innovative use of technology and educational approaches, and the flexibility of education options beyond traditional public schools. Visions is legit with a long, solid track record.

What drew me in was how well Visions served its diverse and inclusive student demographics, including many special needs kids with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs). I can fully relate because my son had an IEP throughout his high school years. I am grateful that he is successful because of the partnership and support we received.

**How might you describe the difference that our teachers and staff are making by meeting the individual and unique needs of each student?**

Each student is unique. Visions teachers and staff understand this and work together to address the social-emotional and academic needs of each student. They employ the appropriate tools, resources, and techniques, including Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS), synchronous instruction, educator cohorts, grade banding, and service-based solutions.

**What is one way that Visions is making a difference in our community from your perspective?**

Communication is key to connecting with our community, and Visions does this brilliantly through The Wire. It is the central newsletter and one-stop shop for our community to stay informed on important announcements, events, stories, news, resources, helpful links, and connections to social media.

**As a member of the Board, you have an important policy and oversight role to ensure the school is achieving its mission. How would you describe your role in holding Visions accountable for meeting our goals to a variety of stakeholders, including families, staff, and taxpayers?**

As a Visions board member, I have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest and benefit of our stakeholders, holding Visions accountable to meet our goals and to achieve the mission. I would hold Visions to facilitate clear and transparent communications, collect/analyze/report on relevant school performance data, implement

stakeholder feedback channels, establish performance targets and accountability measures with a focus on the goals, conduct regular evaluations and performance reviews against the goals, ensuring financial transparency and stewardship with public funds, and foster engagement and collaboration amongst stakeholders.

**What are you most passionate about? How are you able to pursue that passion by serving on our Board?**

I am passionate about technology and data and how they play a critical role to inform and help drive Visions’ goals and policies. Visions’ LPAD Student Support System is the clever technology that provides a secure single point of entry for students, parents, teachers, and administrators [and] that integrates and streamlines programs and platforms. Visions’ use of Data-Driven Instruction encapsulates a robust set of ongoing practices that focuses on assessing student learning, analyzing assessment data, and adjusting instruction in response to the assessment data in intentional cycles. These capabilities make a geek like me happy, and I will continue to support them as a board member.

**Please share a bit about your background, family, and what you like to do in your spare time.**

My family immigrated to America from Taiwan when I was six years old. I spoke only Mandarin when I started first grade and was immersed in an English-only classroom. I struggled at first, but the more I practiced speaking English, the quicker I learned. In high school, I became interested in technology and enrolled in the Electronics Academy program. I graduated college with a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering and [have] worked in the High-Tech industry for the past 30 years.

My wife is a 3rd-grade public school teacher, and my son is studying Computer Science in college. My passion for STEM has had a generational influence.

In my spare time, I volunteer with the Folsom Lake Symphony, Bayside Church Folsom, City of Folsom Community Emergency Response Team (CERT), Intel Medical Emergency Response Team (MERT), lead an Intel PC Pals team, and lead a music jam band. My hobbies include computers, coding, gaming, STEM, music, painting, photography, culinary arts, HAM radio, medical skills, motorcycling, mountain biking, SUP [stand-up paddle boarding], snowboarding, backpacking, various individual and team sports, reading, writing, finance, and gardening.

**Is there anything else you’d like to add?**

Prioritizing your education and developing a growth mindset are the keys that open many great opportunities. Don’t let your circumstances or history determine your destiny. Take ownership of your future, and go do something wonderful!

# Charter School Petition Review Findings of Fact - July 1, 2020

## Education Code 47605(c)

In reviewing petitions for the establishment of charter schools pursuant to this section, the chartering authority shall be guided by the intent of the Legislature that charter schools are and should become an integral part of the California educational system and that the establishment of charter schools should be encouraged. The governing board of the school district shall grant a charter for the operation of a school under this part if it is satisfied that granting the charter is consistent with sound educational practice and with the interests of the community in which the school is proposing to locate. The governing board of the school district shall consider the academic needs of the pupils the school proposes to serve. The governing board of the school district shall not deny a petition for the establishment of a charter school unless it makes written factual findings, specific to the particular petition, setting forth specific facts to support one or more of the following findings:

1. The charter school presents an unsound educational program for the pupils to be enrolled in the charter school.

2. The petitioners are demonstrably unlikely to successfully implement the program set forth in the petition.

3. The petition does not contain the number of signatures required by subdivision (a).

4. The petition does not contain an affirmation of each of the conditions described in subdivision (e).

5. The petition does not contain reasonably comprehensive descriptions of all of the following: [A-O requirements]

6. The petition does not contain a declaration of whether or not the charter school shall be deemed the exclusive public employer of the employees of the charter school for purposes of Chapter 10.7 (commencing with Section 3540) of Division 4 of Title 1 of the Government Code.

7. The charter school is demonstrably unlikely to serve the interests of the entire community in which the school is proposing to locate. Analysis of this finding shall include consideration of the fiscal impact of the proposed charter school. A written factual finding under this paragraph shall detail specific facts and circumstances that analyze and consider the following factors:

   A. The extent to which the proposed charter school would substantially undermine existing services, academic offerings, or programmatic offerings.

   B. Whether the proposed charter school would duplicate a program currently offered within the school district and the existing program has sufficient capacity for the pupils proposed to be served within reasonable proximity to where the charter school intends to locate. 

18 375
<!-- Page 376 -->
(8) The school district is not positioned to absorb the fiscal impact of the proposed charter school. A school district satisfies this paragraph if it has a qualified interim certification pursuant to Section 1240 and the county superintendent of schools, in consultation with the County Office Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team, certifies that approving the charter school would result in the school district having a negative interim certification pursuant to Section 1240, has a negative interim certification pursuant to Section 1240, or is under state receivership. Charter schools proposed in a school district satisfying one of these conditions shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption of denial.

5. ACTION ITEMS (Approval Required)  

5.1 Adopt Resolutions Approving the 2024/25 Final Budget (Resolution-Motion)  
The Board reviewed the proposed Final Budget for 2024/25 and accompanying resolutions:  
a. Resolution 2024/25-6, Approving the Gann Appropriations.  
b. Resolution 2024/25-7, Approving the General Fund Final Budget for 2024/2025  
c. Resolution 2023/24-8, Approving the Parks Maintenance and Recreation Improvement District (Assessment #1) Final Budget for 2024/2025  
d. Resolution 2024/25-9, Approving the Parks Maintenance and Recreation Improvement District (Assessment #2) Final Budget for 2024/2025  

Staff Report  
Manager Chahal gave a summary of the FY 2024-2025 operating and capital budgets. The budget includes a five percent step increase for full-time employees effective July 1, 2024, and a five percent step increase for part-time employees effective January 1, 2025. Chahal advised the board that the budget does not have provisions for potential theft, vandalism, graffiti, and damage done via storms. The combined funds of the General Fund/342A, Assessment #1/396A and Assessment #2/396B highlights include:  
- Projected property tax revenues of $2,545,000.  
- Projected earned income of $776,000.  
- Projected operating expense of $3,363,945.  
- Budgeted capital improvement and equipment of $730,447.  
- Available grant income (received grants not expended) of $510,447.  
- The FY 2024-2025 Budget results in a net decrease in the Reserves of $262,925.  
- Investment into the Police Department is projected to be $296,000. This investment  
<!-- Page 390 -->
![Attachment 4](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+4)

may increase by $100,000 for the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD) that cover a broad array of services including use of their systems for radio, dispatch, record keeping, and property evidence room as FEC does not have the capabilities or department structure to have these services in-house. Additionally, for the 2024-2025 year Mission Oaks RPD and North Highlands RPD have terminated their contracts effective Jun 30, 2024. Mission Oaks and North Highland contracts accounted for 35 percent of the Police Department revenues.

GM Ballus stated the staff is excited about this budget as there are three received grants ready for implementation, and the District’s reserve funds have exceeded $1 million. Staff is requesting investments in capital improvement and equipment projects including a new service truck for maintenance and playgrounds facilities upgrades to make an immediate impact.

Vice Chair Lavallee asked if staff has had the opportunity to reach out to other RPDs regarding any salary step increases and COLA increases policies. Director Lavallee indicated she recommends having a policy that addresses why and when step and COLA increases are provided to staff.

GM Ballus indicated the District currently has five steps and this projected step increase will not impact steps overall. Preliminary discussions in the Personnel and Finance Committee considered eliminating step 1, and subsequently moving step 2 to step 1, and then adding a new step 5, but that discussion was not moved out of committee for the full Board’s consideration.

GM Ballus indicated that peer RPDs use a combination of step and COLA increases, but, to date, staff have not received other districts’ policies that indicate when steps and COLA are to be awarded.

Public Comment:  
No public comments made.

Recommendation:  
Chair Dias called for a motion to approve the FY 2024-2025 budgets. Vice Chair made the motion to approve the FY 2024-2025 budget and the accompanying four resolutions for funds 342A, 396A, and 396B and the Gann Appropriations Limit. Director Higgins seconded the motion. The motion and resolutions passed with a vote of 5-0-0-0.

5.2 Access Between SJUSD Cottage Elementary School and FEC Cottage Park  
Staff Report  
GM Ballus reported that Secretary Seaman has requested staff work with Cottage Elementary to have the gate between Cottage Elementary and Cottage Park open to the public to access either site after school hours. Staff met with Cottage Elementary staff to discuss. Cottage Elementary staff recommended that the public have access in the school via the northern side of the school property, as illustrated in the board packet handout, as that corridor is covered by security cameras and the requested gate access is not. Manger Harder reported that he attended an unrelated SJUSD meeting where school staff indicated SJUSD is making a significant investment in fencing around all school sites that will result in having only one way in and out at each school.

GM Ballus requested the Board provide staff direction on how to proceed with the gate request given SJUSD offered an alternate option.
<!-- Page 391 -->
Public Comment:  
No public comments made.  

Recommendation:  
The Board will consider accepting access to Cottage Elementary School from Cottage Park as proposed by SJUSD.  

The Chair polled each director with the Board collectively accepting SJUSD’s option despite misgivings about doing so.  

5.3 Popup Tent Use in FEC Parks  

Staff Report  
GM Ballus reported that resident Tim Castleman requested staff remove park patron pop-up tents from the parks. Mr. Castleman indicated that the tent user is a homeless person and that tents are not allowed in the parks. GM Ballus advised that overnight camping is not allowed in the parks but that there is no park policy or ordinance on tent use during the day.  

GM Ballus asked the Board to provide direction for staff regarding tents in parks during the day.  

Public Comment:  
No public comments made.  

Recommendation:  
The Board discussed the popup tents and use in the parks. Currently, policy does not prevent daytime usage of tents.  

The Board requested staff collect information on what other park districts may mandate for tent usage.  

The Board recognized that this could turn into a bigger issue and the need for a policy on tent usage may be needed.  

Secretary Seaman reported that Sheriff’s Department has a Homeless Operation Team (HOT Team). Staff would need to submit a letter to the Sheriff’s Department giving them permission to manage any homelessness park issues. He indicated that school districts already employ these letters for assistance. GM Ballus is already in the process of generating the letter to the Sheriff’s Department to handle homeless encampments.  

The Board directed staff to respond to Mr. Casselman and advise him that the board is now aware of the issue, are researching options, and to refer him to the HOT Team as an additional resource.  

5.4 San Juan Unified School District and Fulton-El Camino Recreation and Park District Park and Trail Easement at Katharine Johnson Middle School  

Staff Report  
GM Ballus reported that the easement at Katherine Johnson Middle School for access to Creekside Nature Area presented in April 2023 is being submitted again for board approval.
