**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board hear a presentation from Nutrition Services exhibiting the department’s most recent and notable updates.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) is a federally funded meal program that provides nutritionally balanced, low-cost, or no-cost lunches to children each school day. The program was established under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, signed into law by President Harry Truman in 1946. In addition to financial assistance, the program provides donated commodity foods to help reduce lunch program costs. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for overseeing the program nationally. In California, the program is administered by the California Department of Education (CDE), Nutrition Services Division. Meals served must meet the Federal Meal Pattern Requirements and records kept. Some of the records that must be kept are:
- Meal production records and inventory records that document the amounts and types of food used.
- The number of meals served each day, by site and by category where applicable (free, reduced price, and full price).
- If applicable, applications submitted by families for free and reduced-price meals, by site for a non-CEP site, and a description of the follow-up actions taken to verify eligibility.
- Records of income, expenditures, and contributions received.

On July 9, 2021, Assembly Bill (AB) 130, Chapter 44, Statutes of 2021, Education finance: education omnibus budget trailer bill was signed into law by Governor Newsom. Beginning in SY 2022–23, AB 130 establishes a California Universal Meals Program with changes to the state meal mandate.

The presentation from Nutrition Services will go over the department’s most recent updates on funding, program requirements, meal counts, the Universal Meals Program, etc.

![Assembly Bill (AB) 130 - CA Universal Meals](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

### Assembly Bill (AB) 130 - CA Universal Meals
- California's State Meals Mandate (EC 49501.5) was expanded to provide two meals free of charge (breakfast and lunch) during each school day to students requesting a meal, regardless of their free or reduced-price meal eligibility.
- High poverty schools are required to participate in a federal provision (EC 49564.3) such as the Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) or Provision No. 2. In 2022-23, there were 46 schools combined into one CEP group to receive 51.02% Federal Meal Reimbursement monies.
- The State of California provides additional state meal reimbursement monies to cover the cost of the Universal Meals Program.

All individuals shall be treated equitably in the receipt of district and school services. Personally identifiable information collected in the implementation of any district program, including, but not limited to, student and family information for the free and reduced-price lunch program, transportation, or any other educational program, shall be used only for the purposes of the program, except when the superintendent or designee authorizes its use for another purpose in accordance with law. Resources and data collected by the district shall not be used, directly or by others, to compile a list, registry, or database of individuals based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, national origin, or immigration status or any other category identified above.

District programs and activities shall be free of any discriminatory use, selection, or rejection of textbooks, instructional materials, library books, or similar educational resources.

The use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library shall not be rejected or prohibited by the board or district on the basis that it includes a study of the role and contributions of any individual or group consistent with the requirements of Education Code 51204.5 and 60040, unless such study would violate Education Code 51501 or 60044. (Education Code 243)

The superintendent or designee shall annually review district programs and activities to ensure the removal of any derogatory or discriminatory name, image, practice, or other barrier that may unlawfully prevent an individual or group in any of the protected categories stated above from accessing district programs and activities, including the use of facilities. They superintendent or designee shall take prompt,

Alternatively, such information may be provided through any other cost-effective means determined by the superintendent or designee. (Education Code section 234.7)

The district's nondiscrimination policy and related informational materials shall be published in a format that parents/guardians can understand. In addition, when 15 percent or more of a school's students speak a single primary language other than English, those materials shall be translated into that other language.

# Policy 1312.2: Complaints Concerning Instructional Materials
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992  
**Status:** ADOPTED  
**Printed:** 11/13/2023 01:06 PM  

The Governing Board takes great care in the adoption of instructional materials and is aware that all adopted materials may not be acceptable to all students, their parents/guardians, or other district residents.

The Superintendent or designee is directed to implement procedures which will permit proper consideration of any complaints against the use of any instructional materials or library/media materials, including textbooks, supplementary textbooks, library books, and other instructional materials and equipment.

The Board believes the Superintendent or designee is well qualified to consider complaints concerning instructional materials. Complainants are advised to consider and accept the Superintendent or designee's decision as final. However, if the complainant finds the decision of the Superintendent or designee unsatisfactory, he/she may appeal the decision within 30 days of request.

The Board will not allow political party affiliation, racial prejudice, a desire to suppress ideas, or an intent to deny students access to ideas with which the Board disagrees, to influence its decision in any such case.

(cf. 1312.4 - Complaints Concerning Categorical Aid Programs)

The Governing Board uses a comprehensive process to adopt district instructional materials that is based on selection criteria established by law and board policy and includes opportunities for the involvement of district staff, parents/guardians, and community members, and, as appropriate, students. Complaints concerning the content or use of instructional materials, including textbooks, supplementary instructional materials, library materials, or other instructional materials and equipment, shall be properly and fairly considered using established complaint procedures.

Parents/guardians are encouraged to discuss any concerns regarding instructional materials with their child’s teacher and/or the school principal. If the situation remains unresolved, a complaint may be filed using the process specified in the accompanying administrative regulation and exhibit.

The district shall accept complaints concerning instructional materials only from staff, district residents, or the parents/guardians of children enrolled in a district school. (Education Code section 35160)

However, a complaint related to the use or prohibited use of any existing textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library that alleges unlawful discrimination based on a violation of Education Code section 243 shall be filed, investigated, and resolved in accordance with Board Policy 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.

When deliberating upon challenged materials, the superintendent, or the designee or committee established by the superintendent to review the materials, shall consider the degree to which the materials aligned with the criteria for instructional materials as specified in law, Board policy, and administrative regulation. In addition, such deliberations may consider the educational philosophy and vision of the district; the educational suitability of the materials including the manner in which
<!-- Page 47 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

the materials support the curriculum and appropriateness for the student's age; the professional opinions of teachers of the subject and of other competent authorities and/or experts; reviews of the materials by reputable bodies; the stated objectives in using the materials; community standards; the allegations in the complaint, including the extent to which the objections are based on the dislike of ideas contained in the materials; and the impact that keeping or removing the materials would have on student well-being.

The superintendent, or any designee or committee established by the Superintendent to review the materials, shall not prohibit the continued use of an appropriately adopted textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library on the basis that it contains inclusive and/or diverse perspectives, as specified in Education Code section 243.

If the complainant finds the superintendent's or review committee's decision unsatisfactory, the complainant may appeal the decision to the board.

Any challenged instructional material that is reviewed by the district shall not be subject to further reconsideration for 12 months, unless required by law.

Complaints related to the sufficiency of textbooks or instructional materials shall be resolved as specified in Administrative Regulation 1312.4 - Williams Uniform Complaint Procedures.

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT**  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  

**AGENDA ITEM:** I-5  
**MEETING DATE:** 02/27/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Resolution Reducing or Discontinuing Particular Kinds of Services—TK-12 Certificated  
**DEPARTMENT:** Human Resources  

---

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt:  
1. Resolution No. 4116, reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services, and the corresponding amount of certificated staffing that will be reduced as a result (attachment 1).  
2. Resolution No. 4117, establishing criteria to apply to break a tie in seniority for certificated staff affected by program reductions and who have the same date of hire (attachment 2).  

---

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Each year through a comprehensive student needs assessment, all school sites participate in a process to align student needs to site allocations. As the needs and resources (and often enrollment) change, staffing also changes. At the local level, each school site engages staff, students, parents, and educational partners in various ways to determine the most beneficial actions. Through the needs assessment process, the site determines what positions need to be eliminated, retained, or shifted. The elimination of (or planned elimination of) particular kinds of service (PKS) determines the PKS list.

The district is committed to building a sustainable budget that aligns resources with the Strategic Plan and Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP). This is addressed through the collective work of our entire community and the district is fortunate to have families, local leaders and employees who recognize and value the importance of public education. Instructional leaders are continually evaluating allocation of resources and program delivery models. To best meet the needs of San Juan Unified School District students, changes to the delivery model for certain services have been recommended for the 2024-25 school year.

As a result of the need to make changes, certain kinds of services rendered by certificated employees have been identified to be eliminated or reduced. In order to meet statutory notice requirements for potential reassignments or layoffs, the board needs to adopt the two resolutions specified above.

**ATTACHMENT(S):**  
1. Resolution No. 4116, reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services.  
2. Resolution No. 4117, establishing criteria to apply to break a tie in seniority for certificated staff affected by program reductions and who have the same date of hire.

## RESOLUTION NO. 4116

### BEFORE THE GOVERNING BOARD OF THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

(Resolution reducing or discontinuing particular kinds of services)

WHEREAS the Governing Board of the San Juan Unified School District has decided to reduce or discontinue certain services of the district beginning no later than the commencement of the 2024-2025 school year, and

WHEREAS, as a result of said reduction or discontinuation of services, it will be necessary to decrease the number of certificated employees in the district, and

WHEREAS, California Education Code section 44955 states in part, “the services of no permanent employee may be terminated under the provisions of this section while any probationary employee, or any other employee with less seniority, is retained to render a service which said permanent employee is certificated and competent to render.”

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FOUND, ORDERED AND RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS:

1. That each of the foregoing recitals is true and correct.

2. The Superintendent is directed to take all appropriate action to implement this resolution. The Superintendent and his designees are directed and authorized to negotiate and sign layoff agreements with any employee in order to implement this resolution.

3. All services listed on Exhibit “A” which is attached and incorporated herein by reference, shall be reduced or discontinued not later than the beginning of the 2024-2025 school year in the amounts set forth in Exhibit “A”.

MEMORANDUM  

To: CSBA Member Boards and Even-numbered County Board Presidents and Superintendents  
From: Albert Gonzalez, CSBA President  
Re: 2024 Ballot for CSBA Delegate Assembly — U.S. Postmark Deadline is Fri. March 15  

Enclosed is the ballot material for election to CSBA’s Delegate Assembly from your region or subregion. It consists of: 1) the ballot (on red paper) listing the candidates, the reverse side of which contains the names of ALL current members of the Delegate Assembly from your region or subregion; and 2) the required candidate biographical sketch form and, if submitted, a resume. In addition, provided is a copy of the ballot on white paper to include with your board agenda. Only the ballot on red paper is to be completed and returned to CSBA. It must be postmarked by the U.S. Post Office on or before Friday, March 15, 2024.

Your Board may vote for up to the number of seats to be filled in the region or subregion as indicated on the ballot. For example, if there are three seats up for election, the Board may vote for up to three candidates. However, your Board may cast no more than one vote for any one candidate. The ballot also contains a provision for write-in candidates; their name and district or county office must be clearly printed in the space provided.

The ballot must be signed by the Board President, Board Clerk, or Superintendent as a designee of the board, and returned in the enclosed envelope; if the envelope is misplaced, you may use your district’s or county office’s stationery. Please write DELEGATE ELECTION prominently on the envelope along with the region or subregion number on the bottom left corner of the envelope (this number appears at the top of the ballot). If there is a tie vote, a run-off election will be held, and ballots will need to be postmarked on or before April 30. Results will be published by May 11, 2024.

For County Boards of Education Only:

Per Standing Rule 52, in regions with more than one county, each county board of education has one vote to elect the county board member who represents the county board(s) in the Delegate Assembly. One-county regions will appoint the county Delegate. Your county board may vote for only one candidate to fill the Delegate position representing the county boards within your region. Enclosed is the ballot material for election to CSBA’s Delegate Assembly of the county board representative from

Like the ballot on red paper for the other Delegate seats in your region, it must be postmarked by the U.S. Post Office on or before Friday, March 15, 2024.

The ballot on GREEN paper must be signed by the Board President, Board Clerk, or by the County Superintendent, as a designee of the board, and returned in the enclosed envelope. If the envelope is misplaced, you may use your county office’s stationery. Please write DELEGATE ELECTION prominently on the envelope along with the region number on the bottom left corner of the envelope (this number appears at the top of the ballot). If there is a tie vote, a run-off election will be held, and ballots will need to be postmarked by May 1. The results for the county board seat in each region will also be published by May 11, 2024.

---

**Why are you interested in becoming a Delegate?** Please describe the skills and experiences you would bring to the Delegate Assembly.  
I believe that the Delegate Assembly brings a strong voice to public policy. As a grassroots community leader, it is important to have a balanced approach to ensuring that our policies are aligned with the needs of schools and also practical.

**Please describe your activities and involvement on your local board, community, and/or CSBA.**  
I have spent many decades working and serving in the Del Paso Heights community. I have served as secretary on the Grant Little League. I have served two terms as a cheerleader coach to many students at Grant Union High School. I have served on the UCAN Board helping to promote students going to college. I have also volunteered for over 20 years at the TLC Soup Kitchen helping to feed the community. I have helped to form the Del Paso Heights Community Association. I have served along as a volunteer chaplain at Folsom State Prison for two years.

**What do you see as the biggest challenge facing governing boards and how can CSBA help address it?**  
I believe the achievement gap is the biggest challenge facing governance boards and CSBA can address by providing and promoting learning opportunities on how boards can address this in a practical way.

11. Why are you interested in becoming a Delegate? Please describe the skills and experiences you would bring to the Delegate Assembly. *

I am in my 12th year as a member of the Robla ESD School Board, and have 25 years of experience in career services at the University of California, Davis. That means I have experience in preparing children for college, helping them successfully navigate a top-ranked university, and entering the next chapter of their lives as they graduate and join the workforce. That perspective, and the experience associated with it, should be represented in the Delegate Assembly.

The skills I bring are program analytics, detailed knowledge of the job market and what it takes for people to successfully enter it, program evaluation, and key involvement in DEI topics that enrich districts. I also bring an awareness and experience in how to achieve goals when facing challenges, whether they are financial, structural, or curricular. I have led programs from creation to fruition, and have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to be innovative, develop ideas, and see them through to completion and assessment.

12. Please describe your activities and involvement on your local board, community, and/or CSBA. *

I have been an active member of my school board for 11 years, and have held the roles of President, Vice President (currently), and Clerk. I have also been active on other boards such as the Sacramento Area Bicycle Advocates (SABA). Before joining the Robla School Board I was an active member of Site Council, and actively participated in endorsing and supporting local political candidates.

I have also participated in numerous educational conferences that enhance my KSAs in serving my district's and state's diverse student population.

13. What do you see as the biggest challenge facing governing boards and how can CSBA help address it? *

This is a tough question because there are several large challenges - including funding schools at necessary levels through the current state deficit, the politicization of school boards, school safety, and the effects of COVID-19 on academic performance. I cannot pick one challenge because every corner of our state and many districts face severe and multiple challenges. If you want the single largest challenge, I would say it is providing the children of California with the resources they need to succeed in the face of budget deficits, a polarizing political environment, school safety, and the effects of COVID-19 - among other things.
