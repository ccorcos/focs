![Voters Prioritize Accountability and Repairs](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Voters+Prioritize+Accountability+and+Repairs)

**Voters Prioritize Accountability and Repairs**  
*Ranked by Very Convincing*

- **(ACCOUNTABILITY)** This measure is subject to strict accountability requirements, including independent annual financial audits, review of all spending by a citizens' oversight committee, and no funding can be used for administrators' salaries or pensions. Public disclosure of funds is required by law and all funds are required to be spent locally to improve neighborhood San Juan USD schools.  
  **49%**

- **(LEAD)** A California state audit found that Sacramento County tops the list for the most kids with lead poisoning. Lead is a toxic metal that can cause serious health problems to kids. This measure will help us immediately remove any remaining lead paint from our schools to ensure that our kids are learning in a healthy environment.  
  **43%**

- **(ASBESTOS)** Most schools built before 1980 — like the majority of San Juan USD schools — contain asbestos, and a 2020 analysis by the California Public Interest Research Group Education Fund found that 1,300 California schools tested positive for lead during the prior three years. This measure will improve student safety by safely removing toxic lead, asbestos, and mold from our schools.  
  **39%**

- **(REPAIRS)** Many local schools are over 70 years old and in need of significant repairs. A recent report showed that we have as much as $2 billion in needs. Passing this measure will enable schools to fix deteriorating classrooms, leaky roofs, water pipes, plumbing, bathrooms, and electrical wiring; remove asbestos and lead paint; provide safe drinking water, and replace outdated security and fire safety systems so children can learn in safe, healthy classrooms.  
  **36%**

**Voters are concerned about the State Budget crisis, but less interested in District successes**  
*Ranked by Very Convincing*

- **(STATE BUDGET)** The state is facing a $27 billion deficit this year, and the Governor has already proposed funding cuts that threaten the quality of our local schools. All funds raised by this measure are legally required to stay in San Juan USD, ensuring local control and sufficient funds to address the education needs of children in our community.  
  **36%**

- **(MATCHING FUNDS)** San Juan USD has qualified for matching grants for its career technical pathways classrooms in many of its schools. Passing this measure will ensure that local schools can qualify for up to $400 million in state matching funds and take advantage of funds that would otherwise go to other districts.  
  **35%**

- **(TEACHERS)** Quality classrooms and good teachers are essential to classroom education. This measure will improve the quality of education for every student, and help attract and retain quality teachers by improving classrooms and teaching environments.  
  **31%**

- **(PROGRESS)** San Juan USD's last bond led to safer, cleaner schools, heightened security, and high-quality learning environments throughout the District; but despite the District's smart financial management, many needs remain unmet and the longer these are delayed, the more expensive they will become.

## SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT CLASSROOM REPAIR MEASURE

### DISTRICT FINDINGS

San Juan Unified School District (the “District”) is committed to providing a high quality education to all students in safe, clean schools. The District has conducted a thorough assessment of its school facility needs and received input from teachers, staff and the community and evaluated the District’s urgent and critical needs, and believes it has well over $2 billion in facilities needs, including to fix deteriorating classrooms, leaky roofs, water pipes, plumbing, bathrooms, and electrical wiring; remove asbestos and lead paint; provide safe drinking water, and replace outdated security and fire safety systems.

The District believes that continued improvements to school facilities, including the potential acquisition of sites or of school facility relocations, will improve the quality of education for students while helping the District continue to attract and retain high quality teachers. The District is committed to ensuring students have access to a well-rounded education by upgrading music, visual and performing arts facilities, and learning environments needed to support career technical education and modern learning. The District believes that updating instructional technology will equip our students with skills and a solid background in science, math and technology needed to succeed in college and careers; and

This measure will benefit local District schools, and no funds can be taken away by the State of California (the “State”) or other school districts, and by law, no money can be used for administrator salaries. This measure requires strict fiscal accountability protections including public disclosures of all spending, mandatory annual audits and an independent citizens’ oversight committee to ensure funds are managed and spent properly.

Current District schools include: Albert Schweitzer • Andrew Carnegie • Arcade • Arden • Arlington Heights • Bella Vista High School • Billy Mitchell • Cambridge Heights • Cameron Ranch • Carmichael • Carriage Drive • Casa Roble Fundamental High School • Charles Peck • Cottage • Coyle Avenue • Del Dayo • Del Campo High School • Del Paso Manor • Jerry-Kelly • Earl Legette • El Camino Fundamental High School • El Sereno High School • Encina High School • General Davie, Jr. Primary Center • Gold River • Grand Oaks • Green Oaks Fundamental • Greer • Harry Dewey Fundamental • Howe Avenue • La Vista • Litlejohn • James Cowan Fundamental • John Barrett • Katherine Johnson • Kingswood • La Entrada • Laurel Ruff • Lichen • Louis Pasteur • Mariemont • Mariposa Avenue • Mary Deterding • Marvin Marshall • Meraki • Mesa Verde • Mira Loma • Mission

By approval of this measure by at least 55% of the registered voters voting on the measure, the District will be authorized to issue and sell bonds of up to $950,000,000 in aggregate principal amount, at interest rates not to exceed legal limits and to provide financing for the specific types of school facilities projects listed in the Bond Project List included below, subject to all the accountability requirements specified below.

**ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS**

The provisions in this section are specifically included in this measure in order that the voters and taxpayers in the District may be assured that their money will be spent wisely.

The Bonds may be issued under the provisions of the California Education Code (starting at Section 150100), under the provisions of the California Government Code (starting at Section 53506), or under any other provision of law authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds by school districts and community college districts. The Bonds may be issued in series by the District, from time to time, and each series of Bonds shall mature within the legal limitations set forth in the applicable law under which the Bonds are issued.

**Evaluation of Needs.** The Board of Education of the District (the "Board") has identified detailed facilities needs of the District, and has determined which projects to finance from a local bond. The Board hereby certifies that it has evaluated safety, class size reduction, enrollment growth, and information technology needs in developing the Bond Project List described below.

**Independent Citizens’ Oversight Committee.** Following approval of this measure, the Board will establish an independent citizens’ oversight committee, under Education Code Sections 15278 and following, to ensure bond proceeds are expended only on the types of school facilities projects listed below. The committee will be established within 60 days of the date when the results of the election appear in the minutes of the Board.

**Financial Audits.** The Board will conduct annual, independent financial audits of the bond proceeds until all of those proceeds have been spent for the school facilities projects listed below.

Incidental Expenses. Each of the bond projects described in this Bond Project List include the costs of furnishing and equipping such facilities, and all costs which are incidental but directly related to the types of projects described above. Examples of incidental costs include, but are not limited to: costs of design, engineering, architect and other professional services, facilities assessments, inspections, site preparation, utilities, landscaping, irrigation, bond project construction management, administration and other planning and permitting, legal, accounting and similar costs; independent annual financial and performance audits; a customary construction contingency; abatement; demolition and disposal of existing structures; the costs of interim housing and storage during construction including relocation and construction costs incurred relating to interim facilities; the preparation or restoration of construction, renovation or remodeling; rental or construction of storage facilities and other space on an interim basis for materials and other equipment and furnishings displaced during construction; costs of relocating facilities and equipment as needed in connection with the projects; interim classrooms and facilities for students, administrators, and school functions, including modular facilities; federal and state-mandated safety upgrades; addressing unforeseen conditions revealed by construction/modernization and other necessary improvements required to comply with existing building codes, including the Field Act; access requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act; and costs of the election; bond issuance costs; and project administration during the duration of such projects, as permitted by law.

Furnishing and Equipping. Each project is assumed to include its share of furniture, fixtures, equipment, architectural, engineering, painting, and similar consulting fees, program/project management, staff training expenses and a customary contingency for unforeseen design and construction costs. In addition to the listed projects stated above, the list also includes the acquisition of a variety of instructional, maintenance and operational equipment, including the relocation or reformation of outstanding lease obligations and interim funding incurred to advance bond projects from the list; installation of signage and fencing; payment of the costs of preparation of all facility planning, facility studies, assessment reviews, facility master plan preparation and updates, environmental studies (including environmental investigation, remediation and monitoring), design and construction documentation, and temporary housing of dislocated District activities caused by construction projects. The upgrading of technology infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, computers, projectors, portable interface devices, servers, switches, routers, modules, sound projection systems, printers, digital white boards, document projectors, telephone system, call manager and network security/firewall, wireless technology systems and other miscellaneous equipment.

Alterations to Scope; New Construction. The scope and nature of any of the specific projects described above may be altered by the District as required by conditions that may arise during the course of design and construction. In the event that a modernization or renovation project is more economical for or otherwise determined by the Board to be in the best interests of the District to be undertaken as new construction, this bond measure authorizes said new construction including land acquisition, relocation and construction at a new or alternative site, and/or demolition and reconstruction and/or repurposing on the original site, including an expanded site, and all costs relating thereto. In addition, this measure authorizes the acquisition of real property, including necessary rights of ways or other real property interests, required to expand District facilities, to provide access to

A-5

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

school or other District facilities, or to provide additional school or related facilities. For any project involving rehabilitation or renovation of a building or the major portion of a building, the District shall be authorized to proceed with new construction instead, if the Board determines that replacement and new construction is more economically practical than rehabilitation and renovation, considering the building's age, condition, expected remaining life, and other relevant factors.

Interim Financing Included: Joint Use Projects Authorized. Authorized projects include paying and/or prepaying interim or previously obtained financing for the types of projects included on the Bond Project List, such as bond anticipation notes, and includes prepayment of lease payments to acquire title to facilities and/or equipment previously financed. Projects may also be undertaken on a joint use basis with other public entities.

Bond Project List Not in Order of Priority; Board Determines Prioritization. Approval of this bond measure does not guarantee that the proposed projects will be funded beyond the local revenues generated by the measure, or that projects will be undertaken, or undertaken at any specific District site. The District’s capital needs currently exceed the amount of bonds the voters are being asked to authorize. The order in which particular projects are listed is not intended to suggest priority for funding or completion, and itemization of projects in the list above does not guarantee that any or all such projects will be undertaken. Project priorities will be determined by the Board. The ability of the District to undertake and complete the listed projects may change and is subject to numerous variables including the adequacy and availability of sufficient funding sources. The District is unable to anticipate all unforeseen circumstances which may prevent some of the projects listed above from being undertaken or completed at their timing priority.

Interpretation. The terms of this bond measure and the words used in the Bond Project List shall be interpreted broadly to effect the purpose of providing broad and clear authority for the officers and employees of the District to provide for the school facilities projects the District proposes to finance with the proceeds of the sale of bonds authorized by this proposition within the authority provided by law, including Article XIII A, Section 1(b)(3) of the California Constitution, Education Code Section 15000 et seq. and the Strict Accountability in Local School Construction Bonds Act of 2000. Words used in the Bond Project List such as repair, improve, upgrade, expand, modernize, renovate, and reconfigure are used to describe school facilities projects in plain English but are not intended to expand the nature of such projects beyond what is authorized by law. As such, in accordance with legal requirements, the Bond Project List does not authorize, and shall not be interpreted to authorize, expending proceeds of the sale of bonds authorized by this proposition for current maintenance, operation or repairs.

Severability. The Board hereby declares, and the voters by approving this Bond Measure concur, that every section and part of this bond proposition has independent value, and the Board and the voters would have adopted each provision hereof regardless of every other provision hereof. Upon approval of this measure by the voters, should any part be found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid for any reason, all remaining parts hereof shall remain in full force and effect to the fullest extent allowed by law, and to this end the provisions of this bond measure are severable.

The Full Text of Measure ends at the above line.

# APPENDIX C

## TAX RATE STATEMENT

An election will be held in the San Juan Unified School District (the "District") on November 5, 2024, to authorize the sale of up to $950,000,000 in general obligation bonds. The following information is submitted in compliance with Sections 9400-9404 of the Elections Code of the State of California. Such information is based upon the best estimates and projections presently available from official sources, upon experience within the District, and other demonstrable factors.

Based upon the foregoing and projections of the District’s assessed valuation, the following information is provided:

1. The best estimate of the average annual tax rate that would be required to fund this bond issue over the entire duration of the bond debt service, based on estimated assessed valuations available at the time of filing of this statement, is $60 per $100,000. It is currently expected that the tax will be collected until fiscal year 2054-55.

2. The best estimate of the highest tax rate that would be required to fund this bond issue, based on estimated assessed valuations available at the time of filing this statement, is $60 per $100,000 of assessed valuation. This rate is projected to apply in each fiscal year that bonds are outstanding.

3. The best estimate of total debt service, including principal and interest, that would be required to be repaid if all the bonds are issued and sold will be approximately $1,500,000,000.

These estimates are based on projections derived from information obtained from official sources, and are based on the assessed value (not market value) of taxable property on the official tax roll of Sacramento County. In addition, taxpayers eligible for a property tax exemption, such as the homeowner’s exemption, will be taxed at a lower effective tax rate than described above. Property owners should consult their own property tax bills and tax advisors to determine their property’s assessed value and any applicable tax exemptions. The attention of all voters is directed to the fact that the foregoing information is based upon projections and estimates only, which amounts are not maximum amounts and durations and are not binding upon the District. The actual debt service, tax rates and the years in which they will apply may vary depending on the timing of bond sales, the par amount of bonds sold at each sale and actual increases in assessed valuations. The timing of the bond sales and the amount of bonds sold at any given time will be determined by the District based on the need for project funds and other considerations. Actual assessed valuations will depend upon the amount and value of taxable property within the District as determined by the County Assessor in the annual assessment and the equalization process.

ARTICLE 5: HOURS AND OVERTIME

5.5 Salary Adjustment Reassignment:

Members shall not be required to perform duties which are not fixed and prescribed for the position by the governing board unless the duties reasonably relate to those fixed for the position by the board for any period of time which exceeds four (4) workdays within a fifteen (15) thirty (30) day calendar day period except as authorized herein.

5.5.1 An employee may be required to perform duties inconsistent with those assigned to the position by the governing board for a period of more than four (4) workdays within a thirty (30) day calendar period provided that his/her the employee’s salary is

<!-- Page 34 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

5.17 Extra Hours  
5.17.3 For the purposes of layoff only, the employee shall acquire seniority in the second position based on the employee’s hire date in the second position. The second position may be terminated at any time at the sole discretion of the District and shall not be subject to the layoff provisions or process.  

5.17.6 The secondary position cannot exceed three (3) hours. The sum total of the primary and secondary positions cannot exceed eight (8) hours in any one working day.  

5.17.7 Any classified personnel who agree to provide additional services outside of their calendared work hours shall be compensated at their regular hourly rate (with overtime calculated if applicable) or offered Compensatory Time Off per Article 5.10. The implementation of this article shall not negatively impact classified employees’ access to these opportunities. Additionally, the District shall not supplant these opportunities through the use of volunteers.  

5.19 Optional Professional Development Hours  
For the 2017-2018 school year, all members who assist certificated personnel in providing direct instruction shall have the option of working additional optional professional development hours at their daily rate of pay, that are outside the school day/calendar year. Members may not use Personal Necessity or Sick time to account for these optional professional development hours. The optional professional development hours must be used for professional development aligned to district/school priorities. These optional 2017-18 professional development hours will be scheduled as follows:  

Six hours of optional District-sponsored professional development shall be paid at the member's pre-rata daily rate of pay. The focus will be on the development and implementation of practices that are responsive to the student needs (e.g., language development, differentiation, numeracy and literacy strategies, equity, and classroom management). The dates for these optional days will be calendared as follows:  

Elementary PD Day - Secondary teacher workday  
Secondary PD Day - Elementary teacher workday  

PN and Sick Leave may not be used to cover absence on these optional PD days. Compensation is based on attendance.

<!-- Page 35 -->
5.20 Duties Inconsistent with Assigned Position  
When an individual believes he/she is performing duties inconsistent with those assigned to the position by the governing board he/she may submit a request for a position review after consultation with CSEA and the District. The District and CSEA will jointly develop updates to the position review form as needed.  

The parties agree that the purpose of a position review is to evaluate whether a member is working within the assigned duties of their classification. The District and CSEA agree that it is not their intent for the position review to circumvent salary negotiations that take place during scheduled bargaining cycles.  

Upon receipt of the position review request by the Human Resources Department, the district will have ninety (90) calendar days to complete the position review. The parties agree that the district will be provided a forty-five (45) calendar day extension upon written request. In the event that the district determines that the individual position review requires a broader job classification analysis, the parties will refer to Article 6.7.  

In the event that the District’s position review finds that an employee is working out of their classification and should be placed in a different, existing classification that receives a higher rate of pay, the salary/range adjustment shall be paid retroactively to the date the position review was first submitted.  

In the event the District’s position review finds that an employee is working out of their classification, but no appropriate job classification exists within the District, the District and CSEA will negotiate either:  
- The creation of new job classification, or  
- Which duties and responsibilities should be removed from the member’s current assignment  

ARTICLE 6: SALARIES  

2024-25 school year:  
All base salaries and shift differential (Article 6.2.2) for the General and Operations units shall be increased by a total of 5%, effective July 1, 2024.  
- The new salary schedule will be reflected in members' pay no later than August 31, 2024.  
- The retroactive check for the salary schedules shall be paid no later than September 30, 2024.

Members newly hired into the district for positions subject to the applicable California minimum wage rate shall be placed at the highest step earning minimum wage so that they will earn their annual incremental step increase the subsequent year of employment (e.g., if steps 1-3 are earning minimum wage, they will be placed on step 3 and will increment to step four in their subsequent year of employment).

For continuing members employed as of July 1, 2021, the district shall provide a one-time off schedule payment equal to 3.5% of each member's base salary as of July 1, 2021. This one-time off schedule payment will be paid no later than 60 days from Board approval. This one-time off schedule payment will not increase a member's base compensation for the 2021-2022 school year.

Additionally, effective July 1, 2021, as a result of minimum wage increases and the resulting compaction in the existing salary schedule the parties have agreed to create a new salary schedule for General and Operations Units. Members moved pursuant to this clause will maintain their current step placement on the new salary range placement. Once the new salary schedules have been created the parties agree to move the following classifications as noted below:

- GDA IT/Pre move from 13 to 19
- IA II from 14 to 19b
- OAI from 14 to 19b
- BIA (all languages) from 14 to 18
- IA III from 17 to 22
- IA MSI from 17 to 22
- IA DHH from 14 to 19b
- NSW 1 from 11 to 15b
- NSW 2 from 16 to 20a
- Nutrition Service Cook from 16 to 20a
- Bilingual Translator from 15 to 20

All base salaries and shift differential (Article 6.2.2) for the General and Operations units shall be increased by a total of 10%, effective July 1, 2022.

The new salary schedule will be reflected in members' pay no later than November 30, 2022.

The retroactive check for the salary schedules shall be paid no later than December 22, 2022.

6.2.3 A member who is promoted shall be moved to the step on the new salary range which is not less than a 4.8% percent increase in salary which is not less than a 5% increase in the member’s base salary (not including “hard to staff” differential) and based on the same standards of placement for outside hires. Shift differential shall be included in an employee's base salary for purposes of calculating the 4.8% placement.

**Newly Created Jobs**  
When a new job classification is established by the District, the District will, after giving written notification to the CSEA Labor Representative and its Chapter #127 President, establish a salary range for the new job classification which shall be considered temporary. If no objection to the established salary range thus set is registered in writing with the Director of Human Resources (Classified) by CSEA within 10–20 workdays after the temporary salary range has been set, such salary range shall become permanent.

**6.7.1 Established Positions:**  
When the District determines that a job classification needs to be reviewed, the District shall be responsible for making modifications to the job description and shall then notify the Association of the change in the job description. Any request to negotiate wages, hours, or working conditions of the job classification review must be submitted in writing to the other party within 10-20 workdays of such notice of change. The parties agree that the Association is entitled to periodic updates regarding the status of job classification reviews.

**6.8 Instructional Assistant (IA) Additional Compensation**  
The intent of this Article is to compensate specific Instructional Assistants noted in 6.8.1 that are assigned to the District’s Special Day Classes designated for students identified with mild/moderate or moderate/severe disabilities when a teacher is absent from the class for an entire day and there is no substitute teacher available to cover the class for an entire day.

**6.8.1** The following is only applicable to Instructional Assistant IIs (IA II), Instructional Assistant IIIs (IA III), Instructional Assistant Orthopedic Impairment/Visual Impairment (IA OI/VI), and Instructional Assistant – Multi-Severely Handicapped (IA-MSH), and Instructional Assistant Deaf and Hard of Hearing (IA DHOH) assigned to the District’s Special Education Programs Day Classes designated for students identified with mild/moderate or moderate/severe disabilities. These programs include the following at both the elementary and secondary level:  
- Mild/Moderate Non-Categorical Special Day Classes  
- Mild/Moderate Special Day Classes for Students Diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders  
- Mild/Moderate Therapeutic Learning Classes  
- Moderate/Severe Independent Living Skills Classes  
- Moderate/Severe Special Day Classes for Student Diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders  

**6.8.1 (a)** When a teacher is absent from the class for an entire day two or more hours a day in an elementary class, or one or more periods in a secondary class and there is no substitute teacher available to cover the class, the IAs in these classifications who are regularly assigned to that classroom, and remain in that classroom for the full duration of the school day absence, shall be paid an additional $12.00 an hour an additional $18 an hour, up to $108 per day, to compensate for additional duties and responsibilities they would be expected to assume as a result of the teacher’s absence.

<!-- Page 40 -->
6.8.2 When a teacher is absent from the class for an entire day, and the substitute teacher is unable to fill the entire assignment, the AAs in these classifications who are regularly assigned to that classroom, and remain in that classroom for the full duration of the school day, shall be paid an additional $12.00 per hour for the hours without substitute coverage to compensate for additional duties and responsibilities they would be expected to assume as a result of the teacher's absence.

6.8.3 This additional hourly rate shall not apply when students in the class without a substitute are reassigned to another classroom with a teacher for the day.

6.8.4 It is the responsibility of the Instructional Assistant (IA) to document these hours on a District-approved timecard. These timecards must be submitted by the IA and verified and signed by the principal or designated site administrator.

For the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 school years the parties agree to set aside $20,000 per year in one-time monies to fund a pilot to reduce the time thresholds in 6.6, 6.8.1, 6.8.2, 6.8.3 and 6.8.4 to 3 consecutive hours. Once these funds are exhausted each year, the existing language in 6.6, 6.8.1, 6.8.2, 6.8.3 and 6.8.4 will apply for the remainder of the year. Data collected by both parties during this pilot shall be reported to the respective bargaining teams no later than March 1, 2020. Note: The COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequent school closures, did not allow for Article 6.8.4 to be fully utilized during the 2019-2020 school years. The parties agree to continue this pilot effective November 2, 2020 - Jan 9, 2021. If, during this time frame the one-time funds are exhausted, the existing language in 6.6, 6.8.1, 6.8.2, 6.8.3 and 6.8.4 will apply through June 30, 2022.

In no event shall the differential be lower than $18.00/hour. Additionally, an increase in the compensation for guest/ substitute teachers shall immediately reopen this article for negotiation.

Beginning July 1, 2024, new contractual caseload/classroom maximums for certificated Special Education service providers go into effect. In the 2024-25 and 2025-26 school year only, the parties agree to increase the hourly additional compensation, using one-time funds, by an additional $3.00 per hour (on top of the differential described earlier in this article) for the classified instructional staff due compensation outlined in this article when caseload/classroom maximums are exceeded. The purpose of this additional compensation is to acknowledge the impact to working conditions to classified staff who are providing services to students in settings exceeding new certificated contractual caseload/classroom maximums.

A. Proposed Change in Compensation (Continued)

8. What was the negotiated percentage change? For example, if the change in "Year 1" was for less than a full year, what is the annualized percentage of that change for "Year 1"?

A five percent across-the-board salary increase in 2024-25.

9. Were any additional steps, columns, or ranges added to the salary schedules? (If yes, please explain.)

A Step 7 will be added to the salary schedule in 2025-26, which has a cost equivalent of 3.22 percent.

10. Please include comments and explanations as necessary. (If more room is necessary, please attach an additional sheet.)

Starting in 24-25, hard-to-staff salary adjustments were added for certain classifications as outlined in the tentative agreement (at a percentage cost equivalent of 1.88 percent).

11. Does this bargaining unit have a negotiated cap for Health and Welfare benefits?  
If yes, describe the cap amount.  
Yes ☐ No ☒

B. Proposed negotiated changes in noncompensation items (i.e., class size adjustments, staff development days, teacher prep time, classified staffing ratios, etc.)

Unit negotiated new language regarding mandatory employee orientation, extra hours, and an occupational therapist leadership team.

C. What are the specific impacts (positive or negative) on instructional and support programs to accommodate the settlement? Include the impact of changes such as staff reductions or increases, program reductions or increases, elimination or expansion of other services or programs (i.e., counselors, librarians, custodial staff, etc.)

D. What contingency language is included in the proposed agreement (e.g., reopeners, etc.)?  
If the 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level less than 0.5%, and no augmentation is provided to offset the loss of revenue, both parties agree to revisit the potential impact on the multiyear financial health of the district and examine potential cost saving measures. If the enacted California 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level in excess of 1.5%, or there is an augmentation to the COLA resulting in an increase of revenues beyond the 1.5%, the district and Coalition agree to examine potential enhancements to the salary schedule for Year 1 or Year 2.

E. Identify other major provisions that do not directly affect the district's costs, such as binding arbitrations, grievance procedures, etc.  
None.

F. Source of Funding for Proposed Agreement:  
1. Current Year  
Fund balance, restricted and unrestricted funds.

2. If this is a single year agreement, how will the ongoing cost of the proposed agreement be funded in subsequent years?  
N/A

3. If this is a multiyear agreement, what is the source of funding, including assumptions used, to fund these obligations in subsequent years? (Remember to include compounding effects in meeting obligations.)  
The district has a robust and healthy ending fund balance. Restricted and unrestricted funds will cover the cost of the agreement across all three years. The district expects to deficit spend from its ending fund balance to cover the cost of the settlement. The deficit spending is manageable even beyond the three year projections. The district will monitor its deficit spending in future years and make adjustments as needed to maintain a healthy ending fund balance.

“Before a public school employer enters into a written agreement with an exclusive representative covering matters within the scope of representation, the major provisions of the agreement, including, but not limited to, the costs that would be incurred by the public school employer under the agreement for the current and subsequent fiscal years, shall be disclosed at a public meeting of the public school employer in a format established for this purpose by the Superintendent of Public Instruction [G.C. 3547.5(a)].”  

This tentative agreement was ratified by the Teamsters Local No. 150 on June 17, 2024.

If the enacted California 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level in excess of 1.5%, or there is an augmentation to the COLA resulting in an increase of revenues beyond the 1.5%, the district and Coalition agree to examine potential enhancements to the salary schedule for Year 1 or Year 2.

**E. Identify other major provisions that do not directly affect the district's costs, such as binding arbitrations, grievance procedures, etc.**  
None.

**F. Source of Funding for Proposed Agreement:**  
1. **Current Year**  
   Fund balance, restricted and unrestricted funds.

2. **If this is a single year agreement, how will the ongoing cost of the proposed agreement be funded in subsequent years?**  
   N/A

3. **If this is a multiyear agreement, what is the source of funding, including assumptions used, to fund these obligations in subsequent years? (Remember to include compounding effects in meeting obligations.)**  
   The district has a robust and healthy ending fund balance. Restricted and unrestricted funds will cover the cost of the agreement across all three years. The district expects to deficit spend from its ending fund balance to cover the cost of the settlement. The deficit spending is manageable even beyond the three year projections. The district will monitor its deficit spending in future years and make adjustments as needed to maintain a healthy ending fund balance.

“Before a public school employer enters into a written agreement with an exclusive representative covering matters within the scope of representation, the major provisions of the agreement, including, but not limited to, the costs that would be incurred by the public school employer under the agreement for the current and subsequent fiscal years, shall be disclosed at a public meeting of the public school employer in a format established for this purpose by the Superintendent of Public Instruction [G.C. 3547.5(a)].”  

This tentative agreement was ratified by the San Juan Supervisors Association unit members on June 26, 2024.

- If the enacted California 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level in excess of 1.5%, or there is an augmentation to the COLA resulting in an increase of revenues beyond the 1.5%, the District and Coalition agree to examine potential enhancements to the salary schedule for Year 1 or Year 2.  

**Contingency Language: 2025-26 School Year**  
- If the enacted California 2025-26 State Budget COLA is funded at a level less than 1.73%, and no augmentation is provided to offset the loss of revenue, both parties agree to revisit the potential impact on the multiyear financial health of the district and examine potential cost saving measures.  
- If the enacted California 2025-26 State Budget COLA is funded at a level in excess of 3.73%, or there is an augmentation to the COLA resulting in an increase of revenues beyond the 3.73%, the District and Coalition agree to examine potential enhancements to the salary schedule for Year 2.

**2.4 Term:**

Additionally, the District and SJSA agree to nullify in its entirety the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) titled “Implementation of Additional Investments Under 2022 Tentative Agreement” (signed April 21, 2023).

The District and SJSA agree that the redirection of this ongoing budget allocation results in an unused, one-time amount of $17,955 in the 2023-24 fiscal year.

A. Proposed Change in Compensation (Continued)

8. What was the negotiated percentage change? For example, if the change in "Year 1" was for less than a full year, what is the annualized percentage of that change for "Year 1"?  
A 4.84% across-the-board salary increase in 2024-25. An additional 3.06% in 2025-26.

9. Were any additional steps, columns, or ranges added to the salary schedules? (If yes, please explain.)  
No.

10. Please include comments and explanations as necessary. (If more room is necessary, please attach an additional sheet.)  
N/A

11. Does this bargaining unit have a negotiated cap for Health and Welfare benefits?  
Yes ☐ No ☒  
If yes, please describe the cap amount.  

B. Proposed negotiated changes in noncompensation items (i.e., class size adjustments, staff development days, teacher prep time, classified staffing ratios, etc.)  

C. What are the specific impacts (positive or negative) on instructional and support programs to accommodate the settlement? Include the impact of changes such as staff reductions or increases, program reductions or increases, elimination or expansion of other services or programs (i.e., counselors, librarians, custodial staff, etc.)

**D. What contingency language is included in the proposed agreement (e.g., reopeners, etc.)?**  
If the 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level less than 0.5%, and no augmentation is provided to offset the loss of revenue, both parties agree to revisit the potential impact on the multiyear financial health of the district and examine potential cost saving measures. If the enacted California 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level in excess of 1.5%, or there is an augmentation to the COLA resulting in an increase of revenues beyond the 1.5%, the district and Coalition agree to examine potential enhancements to the salary schedule for Year 1 or Year 2.

**E. Identify other major provisions that do not directly affect the district's costs, such as binding arbitrations, grievance procedures, etc.**  
None.

**F. Source of Funding for Proposed Agreement:**  
1. **Current Year**  
   Fund balance, restricted and unrestricted funds.

2. **If this is a single year agreement, how will the ongoing cost of the proposed agreement be funded in subsequent years?**  
   N/A

3. **If this is a multiyear agreement, what is the source of funding, including assumptions used, to fund these obligations in subsequent years? (Remember to include compounding effects in meeting obligations.)**  
   The district has a robust and healthy ending fund balance. Restricted and unrestricted funds will cover the cost of the agreement across all three years. The district expects to deficit spend from its ending fund balance to cover the cost of the settlement. The deficit spending is manageable even beyond the three year projections. The district will monitor its deficit spending in future years and make adjustments as needed to maintain a healthy ending fund balance.

A. Proposed Change in Compensation (Continued)

8. What was the negotiated percentage change? For example, if the change in "Year 1" was for less than a full year, what is the annualized percentage of that change for "Year 1"?  
   A 4.84% across-the-board salary increase in 2024-25. An additional 3.06% in 2025-26.

9. Were any additional steps, columns, or ranges added to the salary schedules? (If yes, please explain.)  
   No.

10. Please include comments and explanations as necessary. (If more room is necessary, please attach an additional sheet.)  
   N/A

11. Does this bargaining unit have a negotiated cap for Health and Welfare benefits?  
   Yes ☐ No ☒  
   If yes, please describe the cap amount.  

B. Proposed negotiated changes in noncompensation items (i.e., class size adjustments, staff development days, teacher prep time, classified staffing ratios, etc.)  

C. What are the specific impacts (positive or negative) on instructional and support programs to accommodate the settlement? Include the impact of changes such as staff reductions or increases, program reductions or increases, elimination or expansion of other services or programs (i.e., counselors, librarians, custodial staff, etc.)

![San Juan Unified School District Public Disclosure of Proposed Collective Bargaining Agreement](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=San+Juan+Unified+School+District+Public+Disclosure+of+Proposed+Collective+Bargaining+Agreement)

D. What contingency language is included in the proposed agreement (e.g., reopeners, etc.)?  
If the 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level less than 0.5%, and no augmentation is provided to offset the loss of revenue, both parties agree to revisit the potential impact on the multiyear financial health of the district and examine potential cost saving measures. If the enacted California 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level in excess of 1.5%, or there is an augmentation to the COLA resulting in an increase of revenues beyond the 1.5%, the district and Coalition agree to examine potential enhancements to the salary schedule for Year 1 or Year 2.

E. Identify other major provisions that do not directly affect the district's costs, such as binding arbitrations, grievance procedures, etc.  
None.

F. Source of Funding for Proposed Agreement:  
1. Current Year  
Fund balance, restricted and unrestricted funds.

2. If this is a single year agreement, how will the ongoing cost of the proposed agreement be funded in subsequent years?  
N/A

3. If this is a multiyear agreement, what is the source of funding, including assumptions used, to fund these obligations in subsequent years? (Remember to include compounding effects in meeting obligations.)  
The district has a robust and healthy ending fund balance. Restricted and unrestricted funds will cover the cost of the agreement across all three years. The district expects to deficit spend from its ending fund balance to cover the cost of the settlement. The deficit spending is manageable even beyond the three year projections. The district will monitor its deficit spending in future years and make adjustments as needed to maintain a healthy ending fund balance.
