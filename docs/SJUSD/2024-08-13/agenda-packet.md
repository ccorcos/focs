# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
**AGENDA ITEM:** G.1  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**MEETING DATE:** 08/13/2024  

**SUBJECT:** San Juan Teacher Residency Update (Slavensky) - 7:25 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Report: The superintendent is recommending that the board review a report regarding the San Juan Teacher Residency program.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The San Juan Teacher Residency at Alder Graduate School of Education is beginning its third year of implementation. The program was originally approved as a strategy for supporting recruiting and retention efforts, specifically emphasizing our goal to staff hard-to-fill teaching positions with employees who represent the communities we serve. The purpose of this report is to share background information about the residency, a progress report about the residency's key actions and accomplishments and a summary of next steps. Key points in this presentation include the following:  
- Our teacher residents have the opportunity to earn a teaching credential and Master's degree in one year  
- The residency has three key goals: staffing hard-to-fill positions, building career pathways, and diversifying the workforce  
- The residency's success is a result of significant collaboration between Alder Graduate School of Education, our schools, multiple departments, and our labor partners  
- Early data indicates that the residency is having the intended impact on our system  
- Next steps of our work include continuing to track data and exploring options for sustainability

## Impact on Our Mentors

“[Being a mentor] has encouraged me to continue to learn! It assists me in being more attentive to my purpose as a teacher. In addition to this, it is exciting to see how the students have benefitted from having a resident and mentor teacher!” -- Leslie Wilson, Kindergarten, Del Paso Manor

“[Highlights for me as a mentor have been] personal growth as a leader and a coach, empowering a female educator of color, increasing the diversity in my department, and Latinx students seeing themselves represented in the teaching staff.” -- Natasha Correia, Spanish, Mira Loma High School

“I think this is a great program for everyone involved. The residents get a great learning experience with being in the classroom all year, the mentor learns so much about themselves and their teaching practices, the students benefit from 2 teachers, and the school gains a valuable staff member.” -- Babette Poetter, Kindergarten, Howe Avenue Elementary
<!-- Page 49 -->
![Impact on our Schools](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Impact+on+our+Schools)

**Impact on our Schools**

“The Alder program has helped us find great candidates in hard to fill vacancies such as Spanish, Chemistry, Math; given residents an opportunity to be a part of the school community and really develop a more comprehensive understanding of the role each member of the staff plays. The Alder residents essentially work as a co-teacher, and this allows for not only the residents to learn and grow as practitioners, but our students also benefit from having residents in classes. They essentially get a co-teacher for the school year and I’ve seen our students really benefit from the support.” -- Clete Purinton, principal, Bella Vista High School

“The community of Dyer-Kelly has dramatically benefited from the Teacher Residency program. The Residents are hard-working, dedicated individuals who have been able to work alongside our staff to provide even greater attention, time, and resources to our students. These residents have gone on to manage and maintain their classrooms successfully. This retention of qualified candidates allows us to commit to our core values and student goals consistently.” -- Renee Nicholson, vice principal, Dyer-Kelly Elementary School

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## BOARD OF EDUCATION  

### AGENDA ITEM: G.2  
### MEETING DATE: 08/13/2024  

**SUBJECT:** San Juan Education Foundation Update (Allen) - 7:45 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Community Relations  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Report: The superintendent is recommending that the board receive a report of activities and progress from the San Juan Education Foundation.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The San Juan Education Foundation is an independent non-profit organization that provides grants and support directly to San Juan Unified teachers and schools. Grants are provided directly to teachers at three different funding levels and the foundation has grown in scholarship funds given to graduating seniors. A 15-member board leads efforts to raise funds and resources with day-to-day operations handled by an executive director who is employed jointly with the district through a memorandum of understanding.  

2023-24 was an exceptional year for the foundation with events breaking records for attendance and fundraising, the largest donation received in the organization's history and the number of student scholarships growing. This year a total of 46 scholarships were awarded to San Juan Unified students and 68 grants provided support to teacher efforts inside classrooms.  

As the foundation moves forward, a new strategic plan has been adopted focused on increasing fundraising efforts, increasing the organization's supporters, growing awareness of their efforts and achieving sustainability.

## BOARD OF EDUCATION  

### AGENDA ITEM: G.4  
### MEETING DATE: 08/13/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators (Toto) - 8:10 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Human Resources  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt the Declaration of Need for Fully Qualified Educators for the 2024-2025 school year.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Human Resources staff has followed the policies and procedures for hiring fully-credentialed teachers to staff schools for the 2024-2025 school year. While a due and diligent search has been conducted for fully-credentialed teachers, in order to staff all classrooms, Human Resources still anticipates a need to assign certain teachers on the basis of an emergency authorization (Internship, English Learner Authorization, Limited Assignment Permit, Short-Term Staff Permit, Provisional Internship Permit, etc.). Before this can occur, this Declaration of Need must be adopted by the Board of Education and filed with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing.  

In addition, the California Department of Education in collaboration with the Commission on Teacher Credentialing will audit the entire district for credential mis-assignments. Although every effort is made to properly staff our schools, occasionally mis-assignments are identified, and it becomes necessary to request a limited assignment permit to correct mis-assignments.
