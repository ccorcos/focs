![District Overview](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=District+Overview)

Created in 1960 with the merger of six school districts, San Juan Unified School District has a rich tradition in providing all students with the opportunity for academic success and achievement.

The district serves a 75-square-mile area covering the communities of Arden-Arcade, Carmichael, Citrus Heights, Fair Oaks, Gold River and Orangevale.

Today, San Juan Unified is the 10th largest school district in California with an expenditure budget of more than $500 million used to employ more than 5,000 individuals and to educate more than 456,000 students in our early learning, TK-12 and adult programs. More than 10,000 additional K-12 students are served in independent charter schools within the district.

The district consists of 33 elementary schools, eight K-8 schools, nine middle schools, nine comprehensive high schools, three special-education centers, three alternative schools, one adult-education center, two Early Childhood Education centers and one dependent charter.

The student population is diverse. During the 2021-2022 school year, the district’s ethnic/racial makeup was: 0.56 percent American Indian or Alaskan Native, 25.94 percent Hispanic/Latino, 7.18 percent African American, 47.69 percent White, 9.87 percent Asian/Asian American, 0.76 percent Pacific Islander, 0.91 percent Filipino and 7.42 percent multi-race, and 0.6 percent Not Reported.

## Roles and responsibilities of board members and the superintendent

### Board Roles

The role of the board is to provide each student with an education of the highest possible quality within the limits of financial support provided by the State of California. To accomplish this, board members are responsible for five roles identified by the California School Boards Association (CSBA):

**Superintendent Roles**

CSBA identifies the following standards and roles for superintendents working with the Board of Education:

- Promotes the success of all students and supports the efforts of the board to focus on student learning and achievement.
- Values, advocates and supports public education and all stakeholders.
- Recognizes and respects the different perspectives and styles of board members, staff, students, parents and community, ensuring the diverse range of views inform board decisions.
- Acts with dignity, treats everyone with civility and respect, and understands the implications of demeanor and behavior.
- Serves as a model for the value of lifelong learning and supports the board’s continuous professional development.
- Works with the board as a “governance team” and assures collective responsibility for building a unity of purpose, common vision and positive organizational culture.
- Recognizes that the board/superintendent governance relationship is supported by the district’s management team.
- Understands the distinctions between board and staff roles, and respects the roles of the board as the representative of the community.
- Understands that the authority rests with the board as a whole, provides guidance to the board to assist in decision making, and provides leadership based on the direction of the board as a whole.
- Communicates openly with trust and integrity, including providing all board members with equal access to information, and recognizes the importance of both responsive and anticipatory communications.
- Accepts leadership responsibility and accountability for implementing the vision, goals and policies of the district.

**Board Norms**

The governance team commits to accomplishing these standards and roles through:

- Focusing on all students
- Adherence to the Brown Act
- Demonstrating respect
- Creating transparency
- Communicating openly
- Listening actively
- Keeping commitments
- Being collaborative
- Taking the time needed to govern effectively
- Encouraging everyone’s ideas and point of view
- Balancing trustee area representation vs. districtwide responsibility

**Trustee Areas and Representation**

Board members are elected by the voters within their trustee area but serve the students, families and residents throughout the district’s 75 square mile area. As such, board members should consider the impacts of decisions on all constituents when deliberating and take action in the best interest of the district as a whole rather than their specific trustee area. Unless specific to the election or trustee boundary designation processes, information prepared by staff will not delineate data specifically by trustee areas.

To facilitate strong community connections, board members are encouraged to build relationships with the organizations and residents within their trustee area in the manner they deem most appropriate and effective.

**Welcoming new members**

The board president meets with each newly elected member individually to provide a copy of the Governance Handbook, the schedule of meetings, the format for meetings and governance team operations.

The superintendent meets with each newly elected member to provide an overview of the district and to introduce cabinet members and other staff who will be communicating with the board.

District legal counsel will give newly elected members a copy of the Brown Act and inform them they must conform to its requirements as if they had already assumed office.

The governance team attends the swearing-in ceremony and reception for the newly elected members.

**Annual Organizational Meeting**

The annual organizational meeting will be held within the required 15-day period commencing on the second Friday in December.

At this meeting, the board shall
- Elect a clerk, vice president and president from its members.
- Establish the regular school board meeting dates and starting/ending times for the year.
- Appoint representatives to specific organizations and committees and
- Determine locations of board meetings (Board Bylaws 9320, 9140).

**Speaking with a common voice**

All public statements in the name of the board are made by the board president or, if appropriate, by the superintendent or superintendent’s designee.

When speaking to community groups, the media or to the public, individual board members have a responsibility to identify personal viewpoints as such and not as the viewpoint of the board.

When a board decision has been reached, all board members shall support that decision until it is amended or rescinded by board action. Any board member who may wish to criticize or oppose any specific board action should do so in an open board meeting.

**Assigning work to staff**

No individual member of the board, by virtue of holding office, shall exercise any administrative responsibility with respect to the schools; nor as an individual, command the services of any employee. Board members are to channel their requests and/or concerns directly to the superintendent (or, if necessary, through the board president).

**Addressing conflict among board members**

Because the governance team norms are designed to create an open, respectful, collaborative culture, members will engage in dialogue while welcoming an open discussion with different points of view. Members will demonstrate an ability to disagree on issues without taking the disagreements personally. Members will endeavor to maintain neutral body language and tone during deliberations.

**School visitations/Extracurricular events**

School visitations are encouraged to build understanding of the district’s instructional programs, curriculum and
<!-- Page 41 -->

**Board Member Guidelines**

**Communities**  
Board members should make appointments with the school principal prior to visiting a campus. The board member should also email the board administrative assistant, so the visit can be placed on the board calendar alerting other members to the visit, and the superintendent and the board member who represents that trustee area to the visit. This may prevent one school from having numerous visits from different board members during a short period of time. During visits, members should be cautious of interrupting the learning environment.

**Graduations**  
Graduation ceremonies honor the accomplishments of students and the contributions of their families, teachers and staff and other supporters. Each board member participates in the ceremony of the comprehensive high school(s) within their trustee area by certifying the class. Board members participate in the ceremonies of non-comprehensive high schools on a rotating basis.

**Board Meetings**

**Board Meeting Materials**  
Board members will be provided with agendas and copies of all related backup materials for regular meetings at least 72 hours in advance and for special meetings at least 24 hours in advance. Members are responsible for review of all materials prior to the meeting to assist with an efficient and effective deliberative process.

To provide greater access and transparency to materials, the district is adopting a digital materials management platform. Upon request to the board assistant, members will be provided with devices, training, and/or assistance to access materials.

**Placing Items on Board Agendas**  
Board members may place any item on the agenda no later than six days prior to the scheduled meeting date; however, to give staff time to prepare materials, it is helpful to make the request at a regularly-scheduled meeting during the Future Agenda discussion. Requests from board members require a majority vote in order for the item to be added to the Future Agenda.

Board members may request that matters be added to meeting agendas during Future Agenda discussion which occurs during each regularly scheduled meeting. If a majority of board members share an interest in the matter, the board president and superintendent shall determine if the topic is within jurisdiction of the board and schedule the item if so. Items that are not within the jurisdiction of the board cannot be agendized. The board president and superintendent may determine if a request is primarily for informational purposes and may fulfill such a request by providing the desired information as appropriate.

**The Role of Board Members During Board Meetings**  
The authority to direct action rests solely with the full board during public board meetings. A majority vote provides direction to the superintendent. By carefully reviewing the board packet prior to the board meeting, board members can contact the superintendent for questions about an item. All members share a common responsibility to ensure the Brown Act is followed.

**Individual Board Member’s Request for Information, Materials or Action**  
It is important for trustees to be well informed, as oversight of the district is one of the main functions of the board. Trustees recognize that they have no power as individuals to direct staff actions, and that compiling information in response to trustee requests can take staff away from their day-to-day operations of schools and the district. An individual board member will – insofar as possible – work to let the superintendent and staff know ahead of time when a request for information will be made in a public meeting, so the staff can be prepared to provide a thorough response. Staff will make every effort to ensure that board agenda items include thorough background and information.
<!-- Page 42 -->
![Board Meeting Guidelines](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Board+Meeting+Guidelines)

**Board meeting guidelines**

It is important to recognize that a board meeting is the time for the board to do their work in public view. After staff input and public comment, board members are encouraged to ask questions and explain their thinking related to the topic at hand. The board president recognizes members who desire to speak, alternating so that all members have the opportunity to speak. There is not a time limit or limit to the number of questions or comments that a board member may make, but each board member should be respectful of giving other members the opportunity to speak. Nothing in this section will preclude members from speaking multiple times until all discussion is concluded.

Unless a point is important to further understanding of the immediate discussion, the board president will allow all other members to speak first and then add his/her comments or questions.

**Public comments**

Members of the public shall have an opportunity to address the board on any item of interest that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board (Education Code section 35145.4, Government Code section 54954.3). If the public comments on items not appearing on the posted board agenda, the board cannot take action or discuss the comments (Government Code section 54954.2), other than to briefly acknowledge the comments and, if desired, to ask staff for follow-up information.

**Voting**

A majority vote of all members of the board is necessary for the election of officers or for any other action by the board unless otherwise specified by law. Voting shall be by voice and the board administrative assistant records the votes by member, which is placed into the minutes of the meeting.

Unless otherwise provided by law, affirmative votes by a majority of the board’s membership are required to approve any action under consideration, regardless of the number of members present.

The board shall take no action outside of a public meeting except on those matters and under those conditions authorized for closed sessions (Government Code sections 54957, 54957.7; Board Bylaw 9323.2).

**Voting no or abstaining**

Each trustee respects the right of other trustees to vote “no” on an issue. Everyone agrees it is a courtesy to the governance team to explain the reasons for the “no” vote, either during deliberation or before casting the vote. Abstaining on a vote must be announced at the time the topic is first brought up and shall be based on one of the following: 1) the matter affects a close relative of the board member (Education Code section 35707); 2) the vote is to replace the board member’s position on the board (Education Code section 35178); or 3) “remote interests” as listed in Government Code section 1091. If a board member abstains, his/her abstention shall be considered to concur with the action taken by the majority of those who vote, whether affirmatively or negatively.

If a member was absent at the previous meeting, he/she will abstain from voting on the approval of that meeting’s minutes.

**Quorum**
<!-- Page 43 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

A quorum is the minimum number of voting members who must be present at a properly called board meeting in order to conduct business in the name of the board, and is established when a majority of the board members (at least four of the filled positions) are in attendance (Education Code section 35164, Board Bylaw 9323).

## Additional Board Information

### Board-appointed/board-approved committees
Board members appoint community members to committees as determined in committee bylaws. the Curriculum, Standards, Instructional and Student Services Committee and the Facilities Committee. Newly elected board members will be given the option to appoint their own committee members or continue with the current appointments.

Board members serve as the conduit between a board-appointed/board-approved committee and the board as a whole. Board members are not voting members of board-appointed/board-approved committees.

If a board member wants to attend a board-appointed/board-approved committee meeting of which he/she is not the board liaison, the board member should contact the board administrative assistant. This will eliminate the possibility of four or more board members being in attendance at the meeting.

### Electronic media
The Board of Trustees will use electronic media (e.g., email and texting) carefully to ensure that there is no violation of the Brown Act (Government Code sections 54950-54962). The Brown Act prohibits board members from exchanging information outside of a board meeting to:
- develop collective concurrence,
- advance or clarify an issue,
- facilitate agreement or compromise or
- advance an ultimate resolution.

The board recognizes that by using “Reply All” in email responses, the email:
- becomes part of the deliberative process,
- creates a public record and
- inhibits opportunity for any other two board members to have a conversation on a topic.

Board members will be aware of, and follow, district policy as it pertains to electronic communication. The district is subject to requests for public documents as provided by the California Public Records Act (Government Code section 6250 et seq.). Public documents include emails and other correspondence from board members as well as from employees.

Board members who engage constituents via social media are responsible for ensuring that opinions expressed are presented as their own and not those of the board and for following all applicable board policies and state and federal laws.

### Complaints from community/staff
When an issue is brought to a board member, the board member will use active listening to hear what the complaint or issue is. Board members need to remain cognizant of their responsibility for judicial review, staff and student confidentiality and due process when talking with the complainant.
<!-- Page 44 -->
Restate what the complainant has said to ensure that you have heard the information correctly. Ask the person what he/she would like the board member to do with the information and what the individual would like to see as a possible solution. Explain that you will be sharing the information with the superintendent.

Redirect the complainant to communicate with appropriate personnel and utilize the appropriate complaint procedure. Ask the individual to follow up if the problem isn’t resolved.

Notify the superintendent as soon as possible with details of the complaint.

In order to support a positive working relationship among the San Juan Unified School District Board of Education, the staff, students and the community, we have reviewed and agreed to the norms and protocols outlined in the 2022 Governance Handbook. We shall renew these agreements at the end of December annually.

Affirmed on this 25th day of OctoberDecember, 2022.

The Governing Board believes that its primary responsibility is to act in the best interests of every student in the district. The board also has major commitments to parents/guardians, all members of the community, employees, the state of California, laws pertaining to public education, and established policies of the district. To maximize board effectiveness and public confidence in district governance, board members are expected to govern responsibly and hold themselves to the highest standards of ethical conduct.

(cf. 9000 - Role of Board and Members (Powers, Purpose, Duties)

# San Juan USD
## Board Bylaw
### Public Statements

**BB 9010 Board Bylaws**

The Governing Board recognizes the responsibility of board members in their role as community leaders to participate in public discourse on matters of civic or community interest, including those involving the district, and their right to freely express their personal views. However, to ensure communication of a consistent, unified message regarding district issues, board members are expected to respect the authority of the board to choose its representatives to communicate its positions and to abide by established protocols.

All public statements in the name of the Governing Board shall be issued by the board president or, if appropriate, by the superintendent or the senior director of communications, or other designated representative, at the direction of the board president or their designee. No individual board member should make public statements in the name of the board or statements that contravene the policies and actions of the board or that jeopardize the ability of the board to act effectively.

(cf. 2120 - Superintendent of Schools)  
(cf. 9121 - President)  
(cf. 9200 - Board Members)

When speaking for the district, the board encourages its spokespersons to exercise restraint and to communicate the message in a manner that promotes public confidence in the board's leadership.

Board spokespersons shall not disclose confidential information or information received in closed session except when authorized by a majority of the board. (Government Code section 54963)

(cf. 9005 - Governance Standards)  
(cf. 9011 - Disclosure of Confidential/Privileged Information)

When speaking to community groups, the media, or other members of the public, individual board members should recognize that their statements may be perceived as reflecting the views and positions of the board. Board members have a responsibility to identify personal viewpoints as such and not as the viewpoint of the board.

(cf. 1100 - Communication with the Public)  
(cf. 1112 - Public Press, Radio, and Television)
<!-- Page 57 -->
Before voting on any issue, all board members shall be encouraged to present whatever evidence they may feel important to the matter at hand. The board shall fully consider the implications and relevancy of all information so presented. All opinions, reactions, and positions shall be openly discussed, so that each member may understand all aspects of the issue before the board decides the outcome or direction it will take.

When a board decision has been reached, all board members shall support that decision until it is amended or rescinded by board action. Any board member who may wish to criticize or oppose any specific board action should do so in a board meeting.

In addition, the board encourages members who participate on social networking sites, blogs, or other discussion or informational sites to conduct themselves in a respectful, courteous, and professional manner and to model good behavior for district students and the community. Such electronic communications are subject to the same standards and protocols established for other forms of communication, and the disclosure requirements of the California Public Records Act may likewise apply to them.

(cf. 1340 - Access to District Records)  
(cf. 9012 - B Board Member Electronic Communication)

![Bylaw 9012-B: Board Member Electronic Communications](https://example.com/image.png)

**Bylaw 9012-B: Board Member Electronic Communications**  
**Status:**  
Original Adopted Date: 06/09/1992; Revised: October 13, 2015; revised: 2022

The Governing Board recognizes that electronic communication among board members and between board members, district administration, and members of the public is an efficient and convenient way to communicate and expedite the exchange of information within the district and with members of the public to help keep the community informed about the goals, programs, and achievements of the district and its schools. Board members shall exercise caution so as to ensure that electronic communications are not used as a means for the board to deliberate outside of an agendized board meeting, circumvent the public’s right to access records regarding district business, or restrict access to a public forum.

(cf. 1100 - Communication with the Public)  
(cf. 6020 - Parent Involvement and Family Engagement)  
(cf. 9000 - Role of the Board and Members (Powers, Purposes, Duties))  
(cf. 9322 - Agenda/Meeting Materials)

A majority of the board shall not, outside of an authorized meeting, use a series of electronic communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any matter that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board. (Government Code section 54952.2)

Examples of permissible electronic communications concerning district business include, but are not limited to, dissemination of board meeting agendas and agenda packets, reports of district activities from the superintendent, and reminders regarding meeting times, dates, and places.

Board members may engage in separate conversations or communication with members of the public on a social media platform to answer questions, provide information, or solicit information regarding a matter that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board, as long as a majority of the board does not use the platform to discuss among themselves any business of a specific nature that is within the jurisdiction of the board. A board member is prohibited from responding directly to any communication from other board members regarding matters that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board or using digital icons (e.g., “likes” or emojis) to express reactions to communications made by other board members. (Government Code section 54952.2)

Whenever a board member uses a social media platform to communicate with the public about district business or board activities, the board member shall not block access to a member of the public based on the viewpoint expressed by that individual.

Board members may use electronic communications to discuss matters that do not pertain to district business, regardless of the number of board members participating in the discussion.

Board members shall make every effort to ensure that their electronic communications conform to the same standards and protocols established for other forms of communication. A board member may respond, as appropriate, to an electronic communication received from a member of the community and should make clear that their his/her response does not necessarily reflect the views of the board as a whole. Any complaint or request for information should be forwarded to the superintendent or designee in accordance with board bylaws and protocols so that the issue may receive proper consideration and be.

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x971.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

To the extent possible, electronic communications regarding any district-related business shall be transmitted through a district-provided device or account. When any such communication is transmitted through a board member's personal device or account, the board member shall copy the communication to a district electronic storage device for easy retrieval. Like other writings concerning district business, a board member's electronic communication may be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act.

(cf. 1112 - Public Press, Radio and Television)

(cf. 9005 - Governance Standards)  
(cf. 9121 - President)  
(cf. 9200 - Board Members)  
(cf. 9270 - Conflict of Interest)  

In order to minimize the risk of improper disclosure, board members shall avoid reference to confidential information and information acquired during closed session.  
(cf. 4112.6/4212.6/4312.6 - Personnel Records)  
(cf. 5125 - Student Records; Confidentiality)  
(cf. 9011 - Disclosure of Confidential/Privileged Information)  
(cf. 9321 - Closed Sessions)  

Board members may use electronic communications to discuss matters other than district business with each other, regardless of the number of members participating in the discussion.

# Board Policy Manual
## San Juan Unified School District
### Status:

**Bylaw 9124-B: Attorney**  
**Original Adopted Date: 06/20/1992, revised: /2021**

The Governing Board recognizes the complex legal environment in which districts operate and desires reliable, high quality legal advice at reasonable rates. In order to meet the district's legal needs, the Governing Board may appoint, in addition to its general counsel as a district employee, and/or appoint an attorney in private practice as an independent contractor, for whatever purpose the board deems appropriate, and fix and pay such attorney according to the contract. The board also supports pursuing collaborative legal efforts with other agencies and districts as appropriate.

### Duties of Legal Counsel

The board's general counsel and/or independent attorney may perform any of the following duties [Education Code section 35041.5]:

1. Render legal advice to the board, superintendent or designee, board and management employees of the district.
2. Serve the board and superintendent or designee in the preparation and conduct of school district litigation and administrative proceedings.
3. Render advice on school bond tax increase measures and prepare the necessary forms for the voting on these measures.
4. Other administrative duties as assigned by the board and superintendent or designee.

### Retaining Legal Counsel

When the district is seeking legal advice or representation, the superintendent or designee may initiate a Request for Proposals (RFP) to advertise and solicit proposals for legal services. In evaluating the proposals, the board and/or superintendent shall consider the firm’s or attorney’s background experience, and reputation in education law; experience advising or representing school districts in California; fees; and experience of attorneys at the firm who will provide legal services.

The board and/or superintendent shall annually evaluate the performance of the firm and/or attorneys providing legal services in such areas as efficiency and adequacy of advice; results obtained for the district; reasonableness of fees; and responsiveness to and interactions with the board, administration, and community. Upon a successful evaluation, the board may renew the agreement with legal counsel without initiating an RFP.

The board may also contract for temporary, specialized legal services without initiating an RFP when a majority of the board or the superintendent or designee determines that the unique demands of a particular issue or emergency situation so requires.

### Contacting Legal Counsel

At their discretion, the board president or superintendent may confer with district legal counsel subject to any limits or parameters established by the board. In addition, the superintendent or board president may contact district legal counsel to provide the board with legal information or advice when so directed by a majority of the board.

![Bylaw 9130-B: Board Subcommittees](https://example.com/image.png)

**Bylaw 9130-B: Board Subcommittees**  
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992; **revised:** /2022  

The Governing Board president may establish a committee or committees whenever it determines that such a committee or committees would benefit the district by providing diverse viewpoints, specialized knowledge or expertise, or increased efficiency. Such committees may be subcommittees of the board or committees that include members of the community, staff, or other stakeholder groups, create subcommittees of the Governing Board deemed necessary by the Board. Membership on these committees is limited to less than a majority of the whole Board. The Board should endeavor to establish written charges for these subcommittees at the time of appointment. When its charges or duties have been completed, the subcommittee shall be dissolved.

Upon establishing a committee, the board shall clearly define the committee’s purpose, any timeline for completion of assigned responsibilities, any stakeholder groups or individuals to be represented on the committee, length of time that committee members are expected to serve, and expectations for reporting to the board and/or the superintendent or designee. Unless specifically authorized by the board to act on its behalf, the committee shall act in an advisory capacity.

The president may be a member of any subcommittee. The superintendent or designee may serve as an advisor to any subcommittee at the discretion of the board.

Except for subcommittees of the board, committee members shall, as appropriate, be recommended by the board, the superintendent or designee, subject to approval by the board.

The superintendent or designee shall provide committee members with information and assistance necessary for the fulfillment of the committee’s charges, and may serve as a non-voting advisor to the committee at the discretion of the board.

Whenever so charged, committees may actively seek input and participation by parents/guardians, staff, community, and students, and may consult with local public boards and agencies.

Any committee not required by law may be dissolved when its duties or term has been completed or whenever the board deems necessary.

Subcommittees may actively seek input and participation by parents/guardians, staff, community and students, and may consult with local public boards and agencies.

Subcommittees shall act in an advisory capacity, making recommendations to the Board. No subcommittee action shall be binding on the full Board. The Board as a whole shall have the final consideration in all matters. (cf. 1220 - Citizen Advisory Committees)  

**Committee Meetings**  
Unless otherwise exempted by law, board-created committees shall provide public notice of their meetings and conduct meetings in accordance with Government Code sections 54950-54963 (the Brown Act).

However, board subcommittees composed solely of less than a quorum of the members of the board are not subject to open meeting laws unless they are standing committees. Standing committees of the board, irrespective of membership, are those that have a continuing subject matter jurisdiction or a meeting schedule established by action of the board. (Government Code section 54952)

Standing committees with a continuing subject matter jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, those responsible for providing advice on budgets, audits, board policy, contracts, and personnel matters at the board's request.

When a majority of the members of the board attend an open and noticed meeting of a standing committee, the board members who are not members of the standing committee shall attend only as observers. (Government Code section 54952.2)

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x971.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Whenever any advisory or standing committee, including a committee not otherwise subject to the Brown Act, posts a meeting agenda at least 72 hours in advance of the meeting, that meeting shall be considered as a regular meeting of the board for purposes of the Brown Act and therefore must be held within district boundaries unless otherwise authorized by law. (Government Code section 54954)

Committees may meet in a closed session during a regular or special meeting only for those purposes specifically authorized by law for closed sessions held by the board.

![Bylaw 9140-B: Board Representatives](https://example.com/image.png)

**Bylaw 9140-B: Board Representatives**  
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992  

The Governing Board recognizes that effective performance of its community leadership responsibilities may require its participation in district or community committees on matters of concern to the district and its students. As needed, the board may appoint any of its members to serve as its representative on a district committee or on a committee of another public agency or organization of which the board or district is a member or to which the board is invited to participate.

When making such appointments, the board shall clearly specify the authority and responsibilities of the representative(s), including, but not limited to, reporting back to the board regarding committee activities and/or actions. Board representatives shall not exercise the authority of the board without prior board approval.

If a committee discusses a topic on which the board has taken a position, the board member shall express the position of the board. When contributing their own ideas or opinions, the representative shall clearly indicate that they are expressing their individual idea or opinion.

**Board Representative to Elect Members of County Committee on School District Organization**  
At its annual organizational meeting, the board shall designate one board member as its representative to elect members to the county committee on school district organization. (Education Code section 35023)

**Labor Relations Negotiators**  
The Governing Board will designate a chief negotiator(s) to represent it in negotiations with employee organizations. The board itself will not negotiate with any employee organization directly. The chief negotiator shall be an employee of the district even though expert consultants in the field of negotiations may also be contracted to assist in the process of negotiations.

Although the negotiator will represent the board in negotiations, the negotiator shall be responsible to the superintendent or designee, who shall evaluate the performance of the negotiator.

The board's role in the negotiation process will be:

-- To assess, to the best of its ability, the needs of its employees.

-- To set priorities for the total educational program in the best interests of students, the district and public in general.

-- To approve employee agreements that balance employee needs with the educational programs with the need for fiscal solvency of the district.

-- To maintain the board's position of authority and control as provided by law.

**Other Advisory Committees**  
The board may appoint any of its members to serve on advisory committees or as representatives to other public agencies or organizations when the board deems such appointments desirable, contingent on acceptance of the appointment by the member.

# Bylaw 9200-B: Limits Of Board Member Authority
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992; **revised:** 12/13/1994; **revised:** 2022  
**Status:**  

## Limits of Board Members' Authority
The Governing Board has broad but clearly limited powers. The exercise of its authority is restricted to the functions required or permitted by law, and then only when it acts in a legally constituted meeting; recognizes that the Board is the unit of authority over the district and apart from the normal function as part of the unit, that a Board member has no individual authority. Board members shall hold the education of students above any partisan principle, group interest, or personal interest.

(cf. 9000 - Role of Board and Members)

Unless agreed to by the board as a whole, individually, the Board members may not commit the district to any policy, act or expenditure. The Board member cannot do business with the district served, nor should the Board member have an interest in any contract with the school district in general. The Board member does not represent any factional segment of the community, but is rather a part of the body which represents and acts for the community as a whole.

(cf. 9270 - Conflict of Interest)  
No individual member of the Board, by virtue of holding office, shall not exercise any administrative responsibility with respect to the schools, nor, as an individual, or command the services of any school employee. Individual Board members shall submit requests for information to the Superintendent or designee. At their discretion, the Superintendent may refer the request to the entire Board for consideration. If approved, the Superintendent or designee shall perform any necessary research associated with the request and report to the Board at a future meeting. Board members shall refer board related correspondence to the superintendent or designee for forwarding to the board or for placement on the board’s agenda, as appropriate.

Individual board members do not have the authority to resolve complaints. Any board member approached directly by a person with a complaint shall refer the complainant to the superintendent or designee so that the problem may receive proper consideration and be handled through the appropriate district process.

(cf. 1340 - Access to District Records)  
(cf. 9011 - Disclosure of Confidential/Privileges Information)  
No members of the Board shall be asked to perform any routine or clerical duties which may be assigned to an employee, nor shall any Board member become an employee of the district while serving on the Board.

A board member whose child is attending a district school should be aware of their role as a board member when interacting with district employees about their child. Because their position as a board member may inhibit the performance of school personnel, the Board member should inform the superintendent or designee before volunteering in their child’s classroom.

Board members who visit schools of their own volition have no more authority than any other citizen. Board members have authority only in regularly called meetings of the Board, or when delegated specific tasks by Board action.

Board members shall not serve as a volunteer aide in the district.

## Obligations of Members
<!-- Page 80 -->
Members of the bBoard must endeavor to attend all meetings, study all materials presented with the agenda prior to attending the meeting, participate in the discussion of any items which come before the bBoard, and vote on all motions and resolutions, abstaining only for compelling reasons.

(cf. 9240 - Development Inservice)

(cf. 9271 - Code of Ethics)

(cf. 9320 - Meetings)

The bBoard member should not subordinate the education of children and youth to any partisan principle, group interest, or the member's own personal interests.

The bBoard members should be prepared and willing to devote a sufficient amount of time to the study of the problems of education in the district, the state, and the nation in order to interpret them to the people of the district.

**Responsibility of Members and Superintendent re Brown Act**

Board members and persons elected to the bBoard are responsible for complying with the requirements of the subject to Brown Act requirements even if they have not yet assumed office and, for purposes of enforcement under the Brown Act, such persons shall be treated as if they have already assumed office. (Government Code section 54952.1)

Board members and persons elected to the bBoard are responsible for complying with the requirements of the state's open meeting laws. The superintendent or designee shall provide a copy of the Brown Act to each bBoard member and to anyone who is elected to the bBoard but has not yet assumed office. (Government Code section 54952.7)

**Elections Process and Procedures Statement of Qualifications**

The district is divided into trustee areas and each trustee area shall be represented by a board member who resides in and is elected by voters residing within that trustee area. Trustee areas shall be balanced by population as required by state and federal law.

Prior to March 1, following the year in which the results of each decennial federal census are released, the board shall adjust the boundaries of the district's trustee areas based on population figures as validated by the Population Research Unit of the Department of Finance. (Education Code section 5019.5)

To ensure ongoing compliance with the California Voting Rights Acts, the board may review the district's board election method to determine whether any modification is necessary due to changes in the district's population or any of its racial, color, or language minority group composition. The review shall be based on the superintendent or designee's report to the board after the release of each decennial federal census.

**Campaign Conduct**

All candidates, including current board members running as incumbents, shall abide by local, county, state, and federal requirements regarding campaign donations, funding, and expenditures.

A board member shall not expend, and a candidate shall not accept, any public money for the purpose of seeking elective office. However, the district may establish a dedicated fund for those seeking election to the board, provided that the funds are available to all candidates who are qualified pursuant to Education Code section 35107 without regard to incumbency or political preference. (Government Code section 85300)

In order to help protect the public's trust in the electoral process as well as the public's confidence in the board and district, the board encourages all candidates to sign and adhere to the principles in the Code of Fair Campaign Practices pursuant to Elections Code section 20440.

**Statement of Qualifications**

2. Whether the district or the candidate is to pay for the publication of a statement of qualifications pursuant to Elections Code section 13307

The statement may include the name, age, and occupation of the candidate and a brief description, of no more than 200 words, of the candidate’s education and qualifications expressed by the candidate himself or herself. However, the governing body of the local agency may authorize an increase in the limitations on words for the statement from 200 to 400 words. Candidate statements shall be limited to no more than 200 words. (Elections Code section 13307)

When the elections official allows for the electronic distribution of candidate statements, a candidate for the board may, in addition to or instead of submitting a candidate statement for inclusion in the mailed voter’s pamphlet, prepare and submit a candidate statement for electronic distribution.

The board shall ensure that as part of printing, handling, translating, e-mailing, or electronically distributing candidate statements, filed pursuant to Elections Code section 13307. As a condition of having candidate statements included in the hard copy and/or electronic voter’s pamphlet, the district may require candidates to pay their estimated pro rata share of these costs to the district in advance pursuant to Elections Code section 13307.

The Superintendent shall notify the county clerk of this policy on or before the 119th day prior to each election of Board members. (Elections Code section 22510.5)

**Tie Votes in Board Member Elections**

Before each election, the board shall decide whether to resolve a potential tie by lot or by a runoff election. (Education Code section 5016)

- If the board has decided to resolve a tie by lot, the board shall, immediately after the election, notify the candidates who received the tie votes of the time and place where the candidates and/or their representatives should appear before the board. The board at that time shall determine the winner by lot.
- If the board has decided to resolve a tie with a runoff election, the board shall schedule the runoff election in accordance with law.

Prior to each election, the Board shall establish whether a potential tie is to be resolved by lot or with a runoff election.

After an election for which the Board has decided to resolve a tie by lot, the Board shall immediately notify the candidates who received the tie votes of the time and place where lots shall be cast to determine the winner. (Education Code section 5016)

After an election for which the Board has decided to resolve a tie with a runoff, the Board shall schedule the runoff in accordance with law.

**Bylaw 9230-B: Orientation**  
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992; revised:  
**Status:**  

**Board Candidate Orientation**  

The Governing Board recognizes the importance of providing all newly elected or appointed board members with support and information to assist them in becoming effective members of the board. Incoming board members shall be provided an orientation designed to build their knowledge of the district and an understanding of the responsibilities of their position. Such orientation may include the provision of information, support, and/or training related to board functions, policies, protocols, and standards of conduct.

As early as possible following the election or appointment of board members, one or more orientation sessions may be held during open meeting(s) of the board. The board president and the superintendent or designee shall develop an agenda for the meeting(s) and shall identify resources that may be useful for incoming board members.

Upon their election or appointment, incoming board members shall be provided a copy of the Brown Act and informed that, pursuant to Government Code section 54952.1, they must conform to the Brown Act's requirements as if they had already assumed office. Additional information for incoming board members may include, but is not limited to, board bylaws related to the limits of individual board member authority, the conduct of board meetings, and other board operations; governance standards for ethical conduct; legal requirements related to conflict of interest and prohibited political activity; protocols for speaking with district staff, the media; and publications on effective governance practices.

In addition, the superintendent or designee shall provide incoming board members with specific background information regarding the district, including, but not limited to, the district’s vision and goals statements, local control and accountability plan and other comprehensive plans, student demographic data, student achievement data, district policy manual, district budget, and minutes of recent open board meetings.

The superintendent or designee may offer incoming board members a tour of district schools and facilities, and may introduce them to district and school site administrators and other staff.

**[The incoming member(s)]** are encouraged should attend, at district expense and with approval of the board, the California School Boards Association's Orientation for New Trustees, Institute for New and First-Term Board Members, and workshops and conferences relevant to the needs of the individual member, the board as a whole, or the district.

Orientation will be provided for Governing Board candidates so that insofar as possible, new members will be prepared to discuss and cast informed votes on matters before the Board from the time that they are sworn into office.

The Board invites all candidates to attend public Board meetings during the period of their candidacy. The Superintendent or designee shall cooperate impartially with all candidates in providing them with Board policies and public information about school programs.

The Board expects candidates to recognize that until they are sworn in to the Board, they are, like other members of the public, not entitled to privileged information discussed in closed session.

**New Board Member Orientation**  

The Board and the Superintendent or designee shall help each new member elect to understand district operations and the Board's functions, policies and procedures as soon after election as possible. Incoming members shall be given a copy of the Brown Act and informed that they must conform to its requirements as if they had already assumed office. Additionally, they may receive informational materials on the function of the Board and the school system, attend Board meetings, meet with the Superintendent or designee and

**Bylaw 9240-B: Development Inservice Board Training**  
**Original Adopted Date:** June 9, 1992; **revised:** December 13, 1994; **Status:**  

Governing Board members, like teachers and administrators, need inservice training. The public entrusts the Board with the governance of its schools. As part of their job, Board members need to participate in professional development activities that help them understand their responsibilities, stay abreast of new developments in education, and learn new ways to cope effectively with the problems they confront. Such activities include state, regional, and national workshops, conferences, conventions, and seminars such as those offered by the California School Boards Association.

The Governing Board believes that the board's ability to effectively and responsibly govern the district is essential to promoting student achievement, building positive community relations, and protecting the public interest in district schools. Board members shall be provided sufficient opportunities for professional development that helps them understand their responsibilities, stay abreast of new developments in education, and develop boardmanship skills.

The board and/or the superintendent or designee may provide an orientation to newly elected or appointed board members which may include comprehensive information regarding board roles, policies, and procedures and the district's vision and goals, operations, and current challenges. Throughout their first term, board members shall continue to participate in additional educational opportunities designed to assist them in understanding the principles of effective governance, including, but not limited to, information on school finance and budgets, student achievement and assessment, labor relations, community relations, program evaluation, open meeting laws (the Brown Act), conflict of interest laws, and other topics necessary to govern effectively and in compliance with law.

All board members are strongly encouraged to continuously participate in advanced training offered by the California School Boards Association in order to reinforce boardmanship skills and build knowledge related to key education issues. Such activities may include online courses, webinars, webcasts, and in-person attendance at workshops and conferences. In addition, workshops and consultations may be held within the district on issues that involve the entire governance team.

Board members are required to attend at least one or more Board development activities each year. All Board members may attend conferences for the purpose of Board development. Board business shall not be discussed at conferences. Board members shall report to the Board on the inservice activities they attend. Reports shall be given at a regular Board meeting as soon as possible after the Board member's return.

Funds for inservice board training shall be budgeted annually for the board and each board member. In selecting appropriate activities, the board and/or individual board members shall consider activities that are aligned with the district's vision and goals and the needs of the board or individual member to obtain specific knowledge and skills. The board may annually develop a board training calendar in order to schedule and track board training activities and to schedule opportunities for board members to report on the activities in which they participated.

Board members may attend a conference or similar public gathering with other board members and/or with the superintendent or designee in order to develop common knowledge and understanding of an issue or engage in team-building exercises. In such cases, a majority of the board members shall not discuss among themselves, other than as part of the scheduled program, business of a specified nature that is within the district's jurisdiction, so as not to violate the Brown Act open meeting laws pursuant to Government Code section 54952.2.
<!-- Page 99 -->
Board members may report to the board, orally or in writing, on the board training activities they attend, for the purpose of sharing the acquired knowledge or skills with the full board and enlarging the benefit of the activity to the board and district.

**Status:**  

**Liability Insurance**  
The Governing Board shall, in accordance with Education Code §Section 35208, provide liability insurance necessary to protect Board members, officers, and employees while acting within the scope of the office or employment, from claims and judgments resulting from suits brought against them alleging their liability. The insurance shall cover claims in such matters as civil rights actions, negligence, or other acts resulting in accidental injury to any person or property damage in or out of the school buildings while the above-named insured are acting within the scope of their employment, and/or under the direction of the Board, [cf. 3530 - Insurance Management]. Because the determination as to whether personal liability exists is dependent on the specific facts of each case, it is strongly recommended that legal counsel be consulted when questions arise.

**Protection Against Liability**  
No board member shall be liable for harm caused by their act or omission when acting within the scope of district responsibilities. The act or omission must be in conformity with federal, state, and local laws, and made in furtherance of an effort to control, discipline, expel or suspend a student, or maintain order or control in the classroom or school. (20 USC 6736)

The protection against liability shall not apply when: (20 USC 6736)  
1. The board member acted with willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, recklessness, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to the harmed person's right to safety.  
2. The board member caused harm by operating a motor vehicle.  
3. The board member was not properly licensed, if required, by the State for such activities.  
4. The board member was found by a court to have violated a federal or state civil rights law.  
5. The board member was under the influence of alcohol or any drug at the time of the misconduct.  
6. The misconduct constituted a crime of violence pursuant to 18 USC 16 or an act of terrorism for which the board member has been convicted in a court.  
7. The misconduct involved a sexual offense for which the board member has been convicted in a court.

**Status: ADOPTED**  
**Adopted Date:** 06/01/1999 | **Last Revised Date:** 07/01/2018 | **Last Reviewed:** 07/01/2018  

The Board of Education recognizes that its most important function is to establish policies which communicate its direction for the operation of the schools. Policies are written statements adopted by the Board which communicate the guidelines and limits within which the Superintendent or designee and staff may take discretionary action. The Board shall adopt written policies to convey its expectations for actions that will be taken in the district, clarify roles and responsibilities of the board and superintendent, and communicate board philosophy and positions to students, staff, parents/guardians, and the community.

(cf. 2210 - Administrative Leeway in Absence of Board Policy)  
The Board encourages members of the community to contribute information and opinions for the Board's consideration and propose revisions to policy.

The Board shall ensure that district policies align with the district's vision and goals, promote student learning and achievement, provide for consistent and fair treatment of students and staff, and proactively address equity and the provision of equal access to opportunities for all students.

The adoption of policy shall conform with Board bylaws governing agenda, meetings, and voting. Only those written statements adopted and recorded in the minutes shall constitute official Board policy.  
The Board recognizes the importance of maintaining a policy manual that is up to date and reflects the mandates of law. Board policies are binding on the district to the extent that they do not conflict with federal or state law and are consistent with the district's collective bargaining agreements. No board policy, bylaw, or administrative regulation, or any portion thereof, shall be operative if it is found to be in conflict with applicable federal or state law or regulations or court decisions. If any portion of a policy is found to be invalid, that invalidity shall not affect other provisions of the policy.

Policies shall be regularly reviewed at a time allocated for this purpose on the agenda of public board meetings.

San Juan USD  
Board Bylaw  
Closed Sessions  

BB 9321  
Board Bylaws  

The Governing Board is committed to complying with state open meeting laws and modeling transparency in its conduct of district business. The board may hold closed sessions during a regular, special, or emergency meeting only for one or more of the following purposes: authorized by law.  

Each agenda shall contain a general description of each closed session item to be discussed at the meeting, as required by law and specified below. (Government Code section 54954.2)  

In the open session preceding the closed session, the board shall disclose the items to be discussed in closed session. In the closed session, the board may consider only those matters covered in its statement. (Government Code section 54957.7)  

After the closed session, the board shall reconvene in open session before adjourning the meeting and, when applicable, shall publicly disclose any action taken in the closed session, the votes or abstentions thereon, and other disclosures specified below that are applicable to the matter being addressed. Such reports may be made in writing or orally at the location announced in the agenda for the closed session. (Education Code section 32281; Government Code sections 54957.1, 54957.7)  

When an action taken during a closed session involves final approval or adoption of a document such as a contract or settlement agreement, the superintendent or designee shall provide a copy of the document to any person present at the conclusion of the closed session who submitted a written request. If the action taken results in one or more substantive amendments, the superintendent or designee shall make the document available the next business day or when the necessary retyping is completed. Whenever copies of an approved agreement will not be immediately released due to an amendment, the board president shall orally summarize the substance of the amendment for those present at the end of the closed session.

The board may hold a closed session under the "personnel exception" to consider the "personnel matters," that is, the appointment, employment, evaluation of performance, discipline, or dismissal of an employee. Such a closed session shall not include discussion or action on proposed compensation except for a reduction of compensation that results from the imposition of discipline. (Government Code section 54957)

The Board shall publicly report any action taken and the roll call vote, either at the public meeting during which the closed session was held or at a subsequent public meeting. The board may also hold a closed session to hear complaints or charges brought against an employee by another person or employee, unless the employee who is the subject of the complaint requests an open session. Before the board holds a closed session on specific complaints or charges brought against an employee, the employee shall receive written notice of the right to have the complaints or charges heard in open session if desired. This notice shall be delivered personally or by mail at least 24 hours before the time of the session. (Government Code section 54957)

The board may hold a closed session to discuss an employee's application for early withdrawal of funds in a deferred compensation plan when the application is based on financial hardship arising from an unforeseeable emergency due to illness, accident, casualty, or other extraordinary event, as specified in the deferred compensation plan. (Government Code section 54957.10)

Agenda items related to district employee appointments and employment shall describe the position to be filled. Agenda items related to performance evaluations shall specify the title of the employee being reviewed. Agenda items related to employee discipline, dismissal, or release require no additional information. (Government Code section 54954.5)

After the closed session, the board shall report any action taken to appoint, employ, dismiss, accept the resignation of, or otherwise affect the employment status of a district employee and shall identify the title of the affected position.

# Negotiations/Collective Bargaining

Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties involved, the following shall not be subject to the open meeting requirements of Brown Act: (Government Code section 3549.1)

1. Any meeting and negotiating discussion between the district and a recognized or certified employee organization.  
2. any meeting of a mediator with either party or both parties to the meeting and negotiating process.  
3. Any hearing, meeting, or investigation conducted by a fact finder or arbitrator.  
4. Any executive (closed) session of the district or between the district and its designated representative for the purpose of discussing its position regarding any matter within the scope of representation and instructing its designated representatives.  

The board may meet in closed session, prior to and during consultations and discussions with representatives of employee organizations and unrepresented employees, to review the board's position and/or instruct its designated representative(s) regarding salaries, salary schedules, or compensation paid in the form of fringe benefits of its represented and unrepresented employees, and, for represented employees, any other matter within the statutorily provided scope of representation. Prior to the closed session, the board shall identify its designated representative in open session. Any closed session held for this purpose may include discussions of the district's available funds and funding priorities, but only insofar as they relate to providing instructions to the board's designated representative. Final action on the proposed compensation of one or more unrepresented employees shall not be taken in closed session. (Government Code section 54957.)

(Education Code section 48918)

Agenda items related to student matters shall briefly describe the reason for the closed session, such as "student expulsion hearing" or "grade change appeal," without violating the confidentiality rights of individual students. The student shall not be named on the agenda, but a number may be assigned to the student in order to facilitate record keeping. The agenda shall also state that the Education Code requires closed sessions in these cases in order to prevent the disclosure of confidential student record information.

Final action on a student matter deliberated in closed session shall be taken in open session and shall be a matter of public record. (Education Code sections 35146, 48918)

6. To protect records which are exempt from public disclosure under Government Code 6254.

7. To meet with the Board's real property negotiator prior to the purchase, sale, exchange or lease of real property in order to instruct the negotiator regarding the price and terms of the property.

**Security Matters**

The board may meet in closed session with the Governor, Attorney General, district attorney, district legal counsel, sheriff or chief of police, or their respective deputies, or a security consultant or a security operations manager, on matters posing a threat to the security of public buildings; to the security of essential public services, including water, drinking water, wastewater treatment, natural gas service, and electric service; or to the public's right of access to public services or public facilities. Such discussions may be held in closed session during an emergency meeting called pursuant to Government Code section 54956.5 if agreed to by a two-thirds vote of the board members present, or, if less than two-thirds of the members are present, by a unanimous vote of the members present. (Government Code sections 54956.5, 54957)

Agenda items related to these security matters shall specify the name of the law enforcement agency and the title of the officer, or name of applicable agency representative and title, with whom the board will consult. (Government Code section 54954.5)

2.  
   b. (1)—A point has been reached where, in the opinion of the Board based on the advice of its legal counsel, based regarding the existing facts and circumstances, there is a significant exposure to litigation against the district, or the board is meeting solely to determine whether, based on existing facts or circumstances, a closed session is authorized.

   b. Facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, an accident, disaster, incident, or transactional occurrence which might result in litigation against the district, which are already known to potential plaintiff(s) and which must be publicly disclosed before the closed session or specified on the agenda.

**Status:** ADOPTED  
**Original Adopted Date:** 11/24/1992

### Construction of Agenda Content
The Superintendent or designee and the Board president shall prepare an agenda for each regular meeting. Board meeting agendas shall reflect the district’s vision and goals of the board’s focus on student learning and well being. Board members may place any item on the agenda no later than six days prior to the scheduled meeting date.

Each agenda shall state the meeting time and place and shall briefly describe each item to be transacted or discussed, including. The agenda shall also briefly describe items to be discussed in closed session be prepared in sufficient detail to give the background circumstances for items upon which action is recommended or required. Government Code section 54954.2  
(cf. 9122 - Secretary)  
(cf. 9320 - Meetings and Notices)  
(cf. 9321 - Closed Sessions)

The agenda shall provide members of the public the opportunity to address the board on any agenda item before or during the board's consideration of the item. However, the agenda need not provide an opportunity for public comment when the agenda item has previously been considered at an open meeting by a committee comprised exclusively of board members, provided that members of the public were afforded an opportunity to comment on the item, before or during the committee's consideration of the item, and the item has not been substantially changed since the committee considered it. (Government Code section 54954.3)

The agenda for a regular board meeting shall also provide members of the public an opportunity to provide comment on matters which are not on the agenda but which are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board. (Education Code section 35145.5; Government Code section 54954.3)

Each agenda for a regular meeting shall list the address designated by the superintendent or designee for public inspection of documents related to an open session item that have been distributed to the board less than 72 hours before the meeting. (Government Code section 54957.5)  
The agenda shall include information regarding how, when, and to whom a request for disability-related accommodations or modifications, including auxiliary aids and services, may be made by an individual who requires accommodations or modifications in order to participate in the board meeting. (Government Code section 54954.2)

approval of the sSuperintendent. In the absence of the sSuperintendent, their his/her designee shall prepare a recommendation for action.

The agenda shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to comment on any consent agenda item unless such item has been previously considered at an open meeting of a committee comprised exclusively of board members. (Government Code section 54954.3)

Any board action that involves borrowing $100,000 or more shall be discussed, considered, and deliberated upon as a separate item of business on the meeting agenda. (Government Code section 53635.7)

# Bylaw 9400: Board Self-Evaluation  
**Status:** ADOPTED  
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992  

Effective and efficient Governing Board operations are an integral part of creating a successful educational program. In order to measure its own effectiveness, The Governing Board shall annually conduct a self-evaluation in order to demonstrate accountability to the community and ensure that district governance effectively supports student achievement and the attainment of the district’s visions and goals.

The evaluation may address any area of board responsibility, including, but not limited to, board performance in relation to vision setting, curriculum, personnel, finance, policy development, collective bargaining, community relations, and advocacy. The evaluation may also address objectives related to board meeting operations, relationships among board members, relationship with the superintendent, understanding of board and superintendent roles and responsibilities, communication skills, or other governance or boardsmanship skills.

The board shall be evaluated itself as a whole and not as individuals. Individual board members are also expected to use the evaluation process as an opportunity to assess and set goals for their own personal performance.

The evaluation will focus on the internal operations and performance of the Board. The Board members shall develop goals and objectives against which the Board will be evaluated. A self-evaluation instrument will be based on these goals and objectives and not on goals set for the district.

Each year, the board, with assistance from the superintendent, shall determine an evaluation method or instrument that measures key components of board responsibility and previously identified performance objectives. Visual and/or audio recordings of board meetings may only be used as an evaluation tool when consent is given by all board members.

Any discussion involving the board's self-evaluation shall be conducted in open session.

At the request of the board, a facilitator may be used to assist with the evaluation process. The board may invite the superintendent or other individual(s) with pertinent information to provide input into the evaluation process.

Following the evaluation, the board shall set goals, define and/or refine protocols, and establish priorities and objectives for the following year's evaluation. The board shall also develop strategies for strengthening board performance based on identified areas of need.
<!-- Page 157 -->
![Bylaw SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Bylaw+SAN+JUAN+UNIFIED+SCHOOL+DISTRICT)

including, but not limited to, board trainings such as those offered by the California School Boards Association.

Each boardmember will complete the self-evaluation instrument independently. The ensuing evaluation will be based on the resulting composite picture of Board strengths and weaknesses. The Board will discuss the tabulated results as a group.

The evaluation process should include the establishment of strategies for improving Board performance. Revised priorities and new goals will be set for the following year's evaluation.

The Board recognizes that adequate opportunities for Board member orientation and inservice are an essential component of conducting meaningful self-evaluation. The evaluation process shall include suggestions for continued Board member development.

The Board may invite the Superintendent or designee or others to participate in the evaluation and suggest specific criteria to measure Board success as a governing body.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## BOARD OF EDUCATION  

### AGENDA ITEM: G-8  
### MEETING DATE: 10/25/2022  

**SUBJECT:** Updating of Board Policy Titles and Policies/Bylaws for Deletion  
**DEPARTMENT:** Legal Services  

---

**CHECK ONE:**  
For Discussion: ☐  
For Action: ☑  
Report: ☐  
Workshop: ☐  
Recognition: ☐  
Emergency Action: ☐  

---

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt the recommended California School Boards Association (CSBA) titles for the board policies listed in the attachment titled **List of Renamed Policies**. The board is also requested to rescind/delete the board policies and bylaws listed in the attachment titled **List of Policies and Bylaws for Deletion**.

---

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
San Juan Unified subscribes to GAMUT Policy Plus – a service provided by CSBA to help update and maintain current school board policies. The program also provides access to sample policies, regulations, bylaws and exhibits that are updated by CSBA. CSBA has updated GAMUT Policy Plus with a new technology platform that uses a uniform codification system (e.g., policy numbering system). CSBA is recommending that the district rename identified board policies to match the CSBA title in the codification system so we are alerted to updates. The only change will be to the title of these identified board policies.

CSBA also identified some board policies and bylaws that refer to state or federal programs/funding that no longer exist or policies and bylaws that are no longer necessary. Because the policies and bylaws are outdated, it is recommended that those policies and bylaws are rescinded/deleted from the board policy manual.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## BOARD OF EDUCATION  

### AGENDA ITEM: I-1  
### MEETING DATE: 10/25/2022  

**SUBJECT:** Amending District Graduation Requirements for the Class of 2023  
**DEPARTMENT:** Division of Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board discuss amending the district’s graduation requirements for the Class of 2023 due to the disruption in education caused by COVID-19. This recommendation is for the 2022-2023 school year.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
In 2016 the board approved increasing graduation requirements starting with the Class of 2023. The increased graduation requirements project included a plan to communicate the new requirements to family, students, and the community as well as a plan to support students with a tiered approach to meeting the increased requirements. These increased requirements included additional courses in mathematics, science, and world language; however, with school closures occurring due to COVID-19, the disruption to students’ education has impacted many of our current seniors. In order to mitigate these hardships, California built in support for the classes of 2021 and 2022 by adopting Assembly Bill 104 (AB 104) which reverted to the state minimum graduation requirement of 130 credits. There is no legislation to support the class of 2023.  

In order to support the class of 2023 in meeting San Juan Unified’s graduation requirements, staff reviewed current data for seniors, gathered input from staff, students, and the community, and determined there was a significant need to reduce the number of credits needed to graduate. The recommended graduation requirements for the Class of 2023 would include the state minimum of 130 credits with a fourth year of English as an additional requirement.

**Historical Information**  
In 2016 the Board approved increased graduation requirements beginning with the Class of 2023. These additional requirements, given the disruption in educational services due to COVID-19, have created additional barriers for the senior class.

In September 2020, Assembly Bill (AB) 1350 extended relief to the class of 2020 by granting retroactive diplomas to any student on track as of March 2020.

For the classes of 2021 and 2022, Assembly Bill 104 provided options for students and parents/guardians to address learning recovery needs.

As part of AB104, the 130 state minimum graduation rule was available to any student not on track to graduate in four years from the classes of 2021 and 2022.

This year's seniors have been impacted by COVID-19 and there is no legislation to extend relief to the class of 2023.

**AGENDA ITEM:** I-4  
**MEETING DATE:** 10/25/2022  

**SUBJECT:** Adoption of CEQA Mitigated Negative Declaration and Environmental Findings and Project Approval for the Arcade Fundamental Middle School New Construction Lease/Leaseback Project  
**DEPARTMENT:** Facilities  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending the board adopt Resolution No. 4044, adopting the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND), including a Mitigated Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP), consisting of approval of findings that the project will not have a significant effect on the environment.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The purpose is to comply with the CEQA requirements for the project, which is subject to environmental review under CEQA. The district contracted with AECOM to prepare an Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) to identify whether any significant environmental impacts could result from the proposed project.  

The IS/MND determined that the proposed project would not result in any significant environmental impacts that could not be mitigated to a less-than-significant impact on the environment. The IS/MND document can be found at www.sanjuan.edu/ArcadeMod.  

Pursuant to CEQA, a Notice of Intent to Adopt a MND was circulated to the State Clearinghouse, the Sacramento County Clerk, the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District, Sacramento County and potentially interested Native American Tribal representatives for review. The 30-day public review period, September 21, 2022 – October 20, 2022, did not produce any comment letters.

# MITIGATION MONITORING AND REPORTING PROGRAM

## CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT REQUIREMENT

Where a California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) document has identified significant environmental effects, Public Resources Code Section 21081.6 requires adoption of a “reporting or monitoring program for the changes to the project which it has adopted or made a condition of a project approval to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment.”

This Environmental Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP) has been prepared to provide for the monitoring of mitigation measures required of the Arcade Middle School project (proposed project), as set forth in the Final Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND).

San Juan Unified School District (the District) is the lead agency that must adopt the MMRP for development and operation of the project. This report will be kept on file with San Juan Unified School District, 3738 Walnut Avenue, Carmichael, CA 95608.

The CEQA Statutes and Guidelines provide direction for clarifying and managing the complex relationships between a lead agency and other agencies with implementing and monitoring mitigation measures. In accordance with CEQA Guidelines Section 15097(d), “each agency has the discretion to choose its own approach to monitoring or reporting; and each agency has its own special expertise.” This discretion will be exercised by implementing agencies at the time they undertake any portion of the project, as identified in the MND.

## PURPOSE OF MITIGATION MONITORING AND REPORTING PROGRAM

The intent of the MMRP is to ensure the effective implementation and enforcement of adopted mitigation measures. The MMRP is intended to be used by District staff, construction contractors, and others responsible for project implementation.

This document identifies the individual mitigation measures, the party responsible for monitoring implementation of the measure, the timing of implementation, and space to confirm implementation of the mitigation measures.

## ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The District will oversee monitoring and documenting the implementation of mitigation measures. The District or its construction contractor is responsible for fully understanding and effectively implementing all of the mitigation measures contained within this MMRP. Certain mitigation measures also may require coordination with one or more other public agencies in implementing mitigation measures specified herein.

# Attachment B

## CHANGES TO MITIGATION MEASURES

Any substantive change in the MMRP is required to be reported in writing. Modifications to the mitigation measures may be made by the District, subject to one of the following findings, and documented by evidence included in the public record:

- The mitigation measure included in the MND and the MMRP is no longer required because the significant environmental impact identified in the MND has been found not to exist, or to occur at a level which makes the impact less than significant as a result of changes in the project, changes in environment conditions, or other factors.

OR,

- The modified or substitute mitigation measure provides a level of environmental protection equal to, or greater than that afforded by the mitigation measure included in the MND and the MMRP; and,

- The modified or substitute mitigation measure or measures do not have significant adverse effects on the environment in addition to, or greater than those which were considered by the District Board of Education in their decisions on the MND and the proposed project; and,

- The modified or substitute mitigation measures are feasible, and the District, through measures included in the MMRP or other District procedures, can ensure implementation.

## SUPPORT DOCUMENTATION

Findings and related documentation supporting the findings involving modifications to mitigation measures shall be maintained in the project file with this MMRP and shall be made available to the public upon request.

This MMRP will be kept on file at:

| Mitigation Measure 3.5-1 | Unanticipated Cultural Resources | In the event of an inadvertent discovery of cultural resources (excluding human remains) during construction, all work must halt within a 100-foot radius of the discovery. A qualified professional archaeologist, meeting the Secretary of the Interior’s Professional Qualification Standards for prehistoric and historic archaeology, shall be retained by the District to evaluate the significance of the find. If it is determined due to the types of deposits discovered that a Native American monitor is required, the Guidelines for Monitors/Consultants of Native American Cultural, Religious, and Burial Sites as established by the Native American Heritage Commission shall be followed, and the monitor shall be retained at the District’s expense. | During construction | SJUSD and construction contractor(s) | | | |
| 1. Work cannot continue within the 100-foot radius of the discovery site until the archaeologist and/or tribal monitor conducts sufficient research and data collection to make a determination that the resource is either (1) not cultural in origin; or (2) not potentially eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or California Register of Historical Resources. | | | | | | |
| 2. If a potentially eligible resource is encountered, then the archaeologist and District staff shall arrange for either (1) total avoidance of the resource, if possible; or (2) test excavations or total data recovery as mitigation. The determination shall be formally documented in writing and submitted to the District for verification that the provisions of CEQA for managing unanticipated discoveries have been met. | | | | | | |

### Tribal Cultural Resources

| Mitigation | Unanticipated Discoveries |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Measure 3.18-1 | The following mitigation measure is intended to address the evaluation and treatment of inadvertent/unauthorized discoveries of potential tribal cultural resources (TCRs), archaeological, or cultural resources during the project’s ground-disturbing activities. <br><br>If any suspected TCRs are discovered during ground disturbing construction activities, all work shall cease within 100 feet of the find. A Tribal Representative from a California Native American tribe that is traditionally and culturally affiliated with a geographic area shall be immediately notified and shall determine if the find is a TCR (PRC §21074). The Tribal Representative will make recommendations for further evaluation and treatment as necessary. <br><br>When avoidance is infeasible, preservation in place is the preferred option for mitigation of TCRs under CEQA and UAIC protocols, and every effort shall be made to preserve the resources in place, including through project redesign, if feasible. Culturally appropriate treatment may be, but is not limited to, processing materials for reburial, minimizing handling of cultural objects, leaving objects in place when feasible, or returning objects to a location within the project area where they will not be subject to future impacts. Permanent curation of TCRs will not take place unless approved in writing by UAIC or by the California Native American tribe that is traditionally and culturally affiliated with the project area. <br><br>The contractor shall implement any measures deemed by the CEQA lead agency to be necessary and feasible to preserve in place, or minimize impacts to the resource, including, but not limited to, facilitating the appropriate tribal treatment of the find, as necessary. Treatment that preserves or restores the cultural character and integrity of a TCR may |

# San Juan USD
## Board Bylaw
### Meeting Conduct

**BB 9323**  
**Board Bylaws**

### Meeting Procedures

All Governing Board meetings shall begin on time and shall be guided by an agenda prepared in accordance with Board bylaws and posted and distributed in accordance with the Ralph M. Brown Act (open meeting requirements) and other applicable laws.

The board president shall conduct board meetings in accordance with board bylaws and procedures that enable the board to efficiently consider issues and carry out the will of the majority.

The board believes that late night meetings deter public participation, can affect the board's decision-making ability, and can be a burden to staff. Regular board meetings shall be adjourned at 10:30 p.m. unless extended to a specific time determined by a majority of the board. The meeting shall be extended no more than once and subsequently may be adjourned to a later date.

The Board of Education desires to conduct its meetings effectively and efficiently. All Board meetings shall begin on time and shall be guided by an agenda prepared and delivered in advance to all Board members and other designated persons.  
(cf. 9322 - Agenda/Meeting Materials)  
To the fullest possible extent, the conduct of meetings shall enable Board members to: (1) consider problems, weigh related evidence, and make wise decisions, and (2) receive reports on students, personnel and school district operations. The Board shall consider and take any necessary action concerning such reports.

### Parliamentary Procedure

Board meetings shall be conducted by the president in a manner consistent with adopted Board bylaws and generally accepted parliamentary procedures.  
Roberts Rules of Order shall be the authority for parliamentary procedures excepting procedures specifically provided for in the Board's bylaws.

### Quorum and Abstentions

The board shall act by majority vote of all of the membership constituting the board. A majority of the number of filled positions on the Board constitutes a quorum. (Education Code section 5095, 35164)  
Should there be less than a quorum of the Board present at a regular meeting, a time for the adjourned meeting shall be set by members present, and such adjourned meeting shall be deemed a regular meeting. If there are only three Board members present, action may only be taken by.
<!-- Page 231 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  
unanimous vote of those members present.  
**Abstentions**  
The Board recognizes that when no conflict of interest requires abstention, its members have a duty to vote on issues before them. When a member abstains because of a conflict of interest or for any other reason, his/her abstention shall be considered to concur with the action taken by the majority of those who vote, whether affirmatively or negatively.  

The board believes that when no conflict of interest requires abstention, its members have a duty to vote on issues before them. When a member abstains, the abstention shall not be counted for purposes of determining whether a majority of the membership of the Board has taken action.  

Provided the board has seven members and there are no more than two vacancies on the board, the vacant position(s) shall not be counted for purposes of determining how many members of the board constitute a majority. In addition, whenever any provisions of the Education Code require unanimous action of all or a specific number of the members, the vacant position(s) shall not be counted for purposes of determining the total membership constituting the board. (Education Code section 35165)  

**Public Participation**  
Members of the public are encouraged to attend board meetings and to address the board concerning any item on the agenda or within the board's jurisdiction. So as not to inhibit public participation, persons attending board meetings shall not be required to sign in, complete a questionnaire, or otherwise provide their name or other information as a condition of attending the meeting.  

In order to conduct district business in an orderly and efficient manner, the board requires that public presentations to the board comply with the following procedures:  

1. The board shall give members of the public an opportunity to address the board on any item of interest to the public that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board, either before or during the Board's consideration of the item. (Education Code section 35145.5; Government Code section 54954.3)  

2. At a time so designated on the agenda at a regular meeting, members of the public may bring before the board matters that are not listed on the agenda. The board shall take no action or discussion on any item not appearing on the posted agenda, except as authorized by law. (Education Code section 35145.5; Government Code section 54954.2)  

3. Without taking action, board members or district staff members may briefly respond to statements made or questions posed by the public about items not appearing on the agenda. Additionally, on their own initiative or in response to questions posed by the public, board members or staff members may ask a question for clarification.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

make a brief announcement, or make a brief report on their own activities.  
(Government Code section 54954.2)  

Furthermore, the board or a board member may provide a reference to staff or other resources for factual information, ask staff to report back to the board at a subsequent meeting concerning any matter, or take action directing staff to place a matter of business on a future agenda.  
(Government Code section 54954.2)  

4. The board need not allow the public to speak on any item that has already been considered by a committee composed exclusively of board members at a public meeting where the public had the opportunity to address the committee on that item. However, if the board determines that the item has been substantially changed since the committee heard the item, the board shall provide an opportunity for the public to speak.  
(Government Code section 54954.3)  

5. A person wishing to be heard by the board shall first be recognized by the president and shall then proceed to comment as briefly as the subject permits.  

In general, individual speakers will be allowed two minutes to address the board on each agenda or nonagenda item, and the board will limit the total time for public input on each item to 30 minutes. However, in exceptional circumstances when board consent, adjust the amount of time allowed for public input and/or the time allotted for each speaker. Any such adjustment shall be done equitably so as to allow a diversity of viewpoints. The president may also ask members of the public with the same viewpoint to select a few individuals to address the board on behalf of that viewpoint.  

In order to ensure that non-English speakers receive the same opportunity to directly address the board, any member of the public who utilizes a translator shall be provided at least twice the allotted time to address the board, unless simultaneous translation equipment is used to allow the board to hear the translated public testimony simultaneously.  
(Government Code section 54954.3)  

6. The board president may rule on the appropriateness of a topic, subject to the following conditions:  

a. If a topic would be suitably addressed at a later time, the board president may indicate the time and place when it should be presented.  

b. The board shall not prohibit public criticism of its policies, procedures, programs, services, acts, or omissions.  
(Government Code section 54954.3)  

c. The board shall not prohibit public criticism of district employees. However, whenever a member of the public initiates specific complaints or charges,

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

against an individual employee, the board president shall inform the complainant of the appropriate complaint procedure.

7. The board president shall not permit any disturbance or willful interruption of board meetings. Persistent disruption by an individual or group or any conduct or statements that threaten the safety of any person(s) at the meeting shall be grounds for the president to terminate the privilege of addressing the board.

The board may remove disruptive individuals and order the room cleared if necessary. In this case, members of the media not participating in the disturbance shall be allowed to remain, and individuals not participating in such disturbances may be allowed to remain at the discretion of the board. When the room is ordered cleared due to a disturbance, further board proceedings shall concern only matters appearing on the agenda. (Government Code section 54957.9)

When such disruptive conduct occurs, the superintendent or designee shall contact local law enforcement as necessary.

**Recording by the Public**

Members of the public may record an open board meeting using an audio or video recorder, still or motion picture camera, cell phone or other device, provided that the noise, illumination, or obstruction of view does not persistently disrupt the meeting. The superintendent or designee may designate locations from which members of the public may make such recordings without causing a distraction.

If the board finds that noise, illumination, or obstruction of view related to these activities would persistently disrupt the proceedings, these activities shall be discontinued or restricted as determined by the board. (Government Code sections 54953.5, 54953.6)

Because the Board has a responsibility to conduct district business in an orderly and efficient way, reasonable controls shall regulate public presentations to the Board. Members of the public, whether individuals or groups, may address the Board subject to the following procedures:
1. **Methods of Addressing the Board**
   a. **Advance written request.**
   A person who wishes to address the Board other than through visitor comments at a Board meeting should make his/her request to the Superintendent or designee or the president of the Board, preferably in writing, at least 15 school days in advance of the meeting. (cf. 9322 - Agenda/Meeting Materials)
   Such requests, if approved by the Superintendent or designee or president of the Board for placement on the agenda, will be placed on the first agenda allowing sufficient time for preparation and arrangement for informed staff to be present.
   b. **Requests during the meeting.**
   If no advance written request has been made, a person who wishes to address the Board may submit a request with the Director of Communication at the press table, stating his/her name.
<!-- Page 234 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

address and the subject of his/her remarks.  
2. Time in the meeting when speakers will be heard  
Those who have requested to speak regarding an item on the agenda will be recognized by the Board president as that agenda item is presented to the Board.  
Those who have requested to speak under the visitor comments portion of the agenda will be called upon during the 30-minute visitor comment section of the agenda.  
Except as provided by law and Board Bylaw 9323.2, no action or discussion may be undertaken on any item not appearing on the agenda, except for brief responses to statements or questions by the public or refer the matter to the Superintendent or designee. The matter may be placed on the agenda of a subsequent meeting for action or further discussion by the Board. (Education Code section 35145.5, Government Code section 54954.2)  
(cf. 9323.2 - Actions by the Board)  
3. Time Limits  
The portion of the agenda devoted to comments from the public will be no more than 30 minutes in length.  
Comments shall be brief and precise and restricted to the subject under discussion.  
Each individual is limited to one presentation for an agenda item or visitor comments and may not relinquish his/her time to another person. Exceptions to the rule shall be made only by majority vote of the Board.  

Time permitting, each person will be allowed a maximum of two minutes to address the Board. This limit may be waived by majority vote of the Board. The president shall endeavor to give time to speakers who shall strictly control the time allowance in order to facilitate proper conduct of Board business.  
With Board consent, the president may modify the time allowed for public presentation, depending on the topic and the number of persons wishing to be heard. The Board president may rule on the appropriateness of a topic. If the topic would be more suitably addressed at a later time, the Board president may indicate the time and place when it should be presented.  
Each item will be limited to 30 minutes. Board members may initiate waiving of this limit for a particular item. This can be accomplished through Board majority vote.  
The Board may decide to schedule a special forum if extensive public input is necessary on a particular item. The forum should be scheduled on a night before the date when the item is scheduled for action. The forum should be attended by appropriate staff and at least one Board member.  
4. Complaints Against District Employees  
The Board shall not prohibit public criticism of its policies, procedures, programs, services, acts, or omissions. Members of the public or employees with a complaint against a district employee are encouraged to use the district policy for complaints against employees.  
(cf. 1312.1 Complaints Concerning School Personnel)  
Complaints against employees raised in the Board meeting may be referred to staff for follow-up, or the person complaining may be invited to use the complaint procedure process.  
Members of the public may criticize district employees; however, nothing in this section creates an immunity not otherwise identified in law against a defamation or privacy action brought by the employee about whom the complaint is made.  
(cf. 1312.1 - Complaints Concerning School Personnel)  
(cf. 9321 - Closed Sessions)

<!-- Page 235 -->
5. Disturbances  
No disturbance or willful interruption of any Board meeting shall be permitted. Persistence in engaging in disruptive conduct, by an individual or group, shall be grounds for the chair to terminate the privilege of addressing the meeting. The Board may remove disruptive individuals and order the room cleared if necessary; in this case, further Board proceedings shall concern only matters appearing on the agenda. (Government Code section 54957.9)  

Any person who willfully disturbs any public school or any public school meeting is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine of not more than $500. (Education Code section 32210)  

6. Smoking at Board Meetings  
Smoking is prohibited at Board meetings and on district property.  
(cf. 9320 - Meetings)  
(cf. 9312 - Closed Sessions)  
(cf. 9322 - Agenda/Meeting Materials)  
(cf. 9323.2 - Actions by the Board)

**J. CERTIFICATION NO. 1: CERTIFICATION OF THE DISTRICT'S ABILITY TO MEET THE COSTS OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT**

This certification page must be signed by the district's Superintendent and Chief Business Official at the time of public disclosure and is intended to assist the district's Governing Board in determining whether the district can meet the costs incurred under the tentative Collective Bargaining Agreement in the current and subsequent years. The absence of a certification signature or if "I am unable to certify" is checked should serve as a "red flag" to the district's Governing Board.

In accordance with the requirements of Government Code Sections 3540.2 and 3547.5, the Superintendent and Chief Business Official of the San Juan Unified School District, hereby certify that the District can meet the costs incurred under this Collective Bargaining Agreement during the term of the agreement from 7/1/2022 to 6/30/2024.

**Board Actions**  
The board actions necessary to meet the cost of the agreement in each year of its term are as follows:

**Current Year**  
**Budget Adjustment Categories:**  
Revenues/Transfers In and Other Sources/Contributions $ -  
Expenditures/Transfers Out and Other Uses $ 770,542  
Ending Balance(s) Increase/(Decrease) $ (770,542)  

**Subsequent Years**  
**Budget Adjustment Categories:**  
Revenues/Transfers In and Other Sources/Contributions $ -  
Expenditures/Transfers Out and Other Uses $ 805,216  
Ending Balance(s) Increase/(Decrease) $ (805,216)  

**Budget Revisions**  
If the district does not adopt and submit within 45 days all of the revisions to its budget needed in the current year to meet the costs of the agreement at the time of the approval of the proposed collective bargaining agreement, the county superintendent of schools is required to issue a qualified or negative certification for the district on its next interim report.

**Assumptions and Explanations** (enter or attach documentation)

The assumptions upon which this certification is made are as follows:
- Used assumptions included in our 45 day revise and COLA of 13.26% in 2022/23 per DOF revised calculation.
- Assumed 10.75% increase for Teamsters in 22/23 and all units in Out years along with an increase of 4.5% for all units in all years.
- Assumed our typical S&C of .9% for both certificated and classified and H&W historical rate of 4.32% growth.

Concerns regarding affordability of agreement in subsequent years (if any):
- Although the MYP reflects deficit spending the majority is due to the use of one-time restricted funds being used in all three years.
- Year 2023/24 reflects a deficit as a result of the increase that is intentional as we have on-going unrestricted funds falling to fund balance prior to this settlement agreement.

**J. CERTIFICATION NO. 1: CERTIFICATION OF THE DISTRICT'S ABILITY TO MEET THE COSTS OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT**

This certification page must be signed by the district's Superintendent and Chief Business Official at the time of public disclosure and is intended to assist the district's Governing Board in determining whether the district can meet the costs incurred under the tentative Collective Bargaining Agreement in the current and subsequent years. The absence of a certification signature or if "I am unable to certify" is checked should serve as a "red flag" to the district's Governing Board.

In accordance with the requirements of Government Code Sections 3540.2 and 3547.5, the Superintendent and Chief Business Official of the San Juan Unified School District, hereby certify that the District can meet the costs incurred under this Collective Bargaining Agreement during the term of the agreement from 7/1/2022 to 6/30/2024.

**Board Actions**  
The board actions necessary to meet the cost of the agreement in each year of its term are as follows:

**Current Year**  
**Budget Adjustment Categories:**  
Revenues/Transfers In and Other Sources/Contributions $ -  
Expenditures/Transfers Out and Other Uses $ 4,249,227  
Ending Balance(s) Increase/(Decrease) $ (4,249,227)  

**Subsequent Years**  
**Budget Adjustment Categories:**  
Revenues/Transfers In and Other Sources/Contributions $ -  
Expenditures/Transfers Out and Other Uses $ 4,440,442  
Ending Balance(s) Increase/(Decrease) $ (4,440,442)  

**Budget Revisions**  
If the district does not adopt and submit within 45 days all of the revisions to its budget needed in the current year to meet the costs of the agreement at the time of the approval of the proposed collective bargaining agreement, the county superintendent of schools is required to issue a qualified or negative certification for the district on its next interim report.

**Assumptions**  
See attached page for a list of the assumptions upon which this certification is based.

**Assumptions and Explanations (enter or attach documentation)**

The assumptions upon which this certification is made are as follows:  
Used assumptions included in our 45 day revise and COLA of 13.26% in 2022/23 per DOF revised calculation.  
Assumed 10.75% increase for SJAA, Board Contracts and Superintendent in 22/23 and all units in Out years along with an increase of 4.5% for all units in all years. Assumed our typical S&C of .9% for both certificated and classified and H&W historical rate of 4.32%.  

Concerns regarding affordability of agreement in subsequent years (if any):  
Although the MYP reflects deficit spending the majority is due to the use of one-time restricted funds being used in all three years.  
Year 2023/24 reflects a deficit as a result of the increase that is intentional as we have on-going unrestricted funds falling to fund balance prior to this settlement agreement.
