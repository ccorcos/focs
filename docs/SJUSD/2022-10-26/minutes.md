Amending District Graduation Requirements for the Class of 2023 (I-1)  
Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Education and Programs Kristan Schnepp gave a presentation regarding amending the district’s graduation requirements for the Class of 2023. Ms. Schnepp provided historical context, noting that in 2016 the district approved increasing graduation requirements starting with the Class of 2023, which included additional courses in mathematics, science, and world language; however, with school closures occurring due to COVID-19, the disruption to students’ education has impacted many of the current seniors and there is no state legislation to support the Class of 2023. Ms. Schnepp said that staff reviewed current data for seniors and gathered input from staff, students, and the community, and ultimately determined that there was a significant need to reduce the number of credits needed to graduate. Ms. Schnepp explained that the recommendation to amend the graduation requirements for the Class of 2023 would include the state minimum of 130 credits with a fourth year of English as an additional requirement.
