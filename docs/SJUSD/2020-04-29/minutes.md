## Early Learning Update (G-1)
Senior Director of Elementary Education Amberstone Townsend-Snider, English Language Arts Program Specialist Nicole Kukral and Early Learning Support Teacher Amy Gondek provided an update on early learning in the district related to literacy. The report included specifics about the newest literacy bridges (between transitional kindergarten and kindergarten and early childhood education and kindergarten) and reading instruction (specifically, phonological awareness). Virtual field trips into classrooms were shared via video. After the presentation, staff answered questions from the board.

## California Voting Rights Act (G-2)
General Counsel Linda Simlick introduced Michelle Cannon, an attorney from Lozano Smith Attorneys at Law, who provided information regarding the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA). Ms. Cannon discussed information related to a recent letter received from attorney Scott Rafferty, then gave a presentation, which included a review of the CVRA timeline and Governor Newsom’s executive orders related to COVID-19. Ms. Cannon also explained Resolution No. 2991, which would temporarily postpone the CVRA process until the governor’s orders are lifted.

After a 45-minute recess to address technology concerns, Ms. Villescaz made comments on the reasons why this resolution is being considered at this time, rather than moving forward with the CVRA process. Ms. Villescaz stated that the board is committed to moving to by-trustee area elections, as evidenced by the passage of a prior resolution, and will engage in community input once the COVID-19 restrictions allow for this, as the health and safety of the community is of utmost importance at this time.

## Visitor Comments: [via Zoom]
- Amy Kascik encourages urgently moving forward with by-district elections in order to provide all students and communities with electoral equity.
- David Ball-Hawkins urged the board to change to by-trustee area elections and increase from a five-member to a seven-member board this fall when voter turnout is historically high.
- Juan Yñiguez expressed support for a seven-member board and continuing with the process.
- Scott Rafferty made comments regarding the lack of community outreach efforts, alleged Brown Act violations and the importance of having a lawful election.

Magali Kincaid urged the board to continue with the adopted timeline, comply with the CVRA in time for the November 2020 elections, and supports having a seven-member board.

Clarissa Alva stated she supports moving to by-trustee area elections, but acknowledged it is important to wait in order to be able to do more community outreach before making this big decision.

After visitor comments, Ms. Villescaz invited board members to speak. Mr. Hernandez stated that, due to COVID-19, these are not normal times, and attaining community input during a pandemic is not right. Ms. Costa commented that while she supports by-trustee area elections, moving forward now to get community input would make people choose between their democratic process and their health and safety; so she supports pausing the process and moving forward at a later date. Ms. Creason asked clarifying questions regarding the exposure to litigation and the process to change to a seven-member board, which Ms. Cannon answered; and Ms. Creason also made comments related to the challenges of conducting an effective community outreach plan at this time. Dr. McKibbin stated that he, too, looks forward to moving ahead with the CVRA process, but recognizes that, during COVID-19, there is not the same opportunity for thoughtful discussions and ample outreach. Ms. Villescaz stated she agrees with the comments made by other board members, and she noted that the idea of moving to a seven-member board did not come up until after the process had started.

It was moved by Dr. McKibbin, seconded by Mr. Hernandez, to adopt Resolution No. 2991, declaring an intent to temporarily postpone hearings related to the board’s transition to by-trustee area elections until such time as neither state nor local public health officials recommend or impose social-distancing measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. **MOTION CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY** [Villescaz, McKibbin, Creason, Costa, Hernandez].

Ms. Villescaz acknowledged the passing of former Mira Loma High School teacher Guy Roberts.
