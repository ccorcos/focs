AGENDA ITEM: G.6  
MEETING DATE: 08/27/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Proposition 28 Annual Report  
**DEPARTMENT:** Teaching and Learning  
**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the Proposition 28 Annual Report.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Proposition 28 requires the Board of Education of a local education agency to approve, on an annual basis, a report that details the type of arts education programs funded by the program. The report must also include the following information which was funded by Proposition 28 in the fiscal year: the number of full-time equivalent teachers, classified personnel, teaching aides, the number of pupils served, and the number of schools providing arts education programs.

# Proposition 28 Annual Report 2023-2024

1. **Narrative description of the Proposition 28 arts education programs funded:**

   During spring 2024, San Juan Unified used Proposition 28 funding to increase arts education in its elementary schools by increasing arts education positions by 20%. All elementary schools had the opportunity to increase arts education through the addition of credentialed personnel in the areas of visual art, theater, dance, music or media arts. A survey was conducted that asked each school to list which content area they would like to increase or add. District staff has worked to reorganize and schedule additional staffing to accommodate the schools’ requests.

   In December 2023 and through the spring 2024, schools had the option to pilot the increase and design of programs that fit community needs and interests. Arts educators collaborated with site administration, school leadership teams and parent groups to determine best methods to deliver opportunities in the arts to students.

   Using 2023-24 as a development year, in the 2024-25 school year, students at all elementary/K-8 schools will experience an increase in arts education opportunities by 20% or 160 minutes a week, up from 120 minutes a week. Challenges with scheduling and finding qualified arts education staff have occurred and with time, will be mitigated. Facility space is also a challenge.

   At the secondary level, middle and high schools had the opportunity to increase arts educators to full time positions at most schools. For example, a band teacher might have had to split a day between two schools and now is at one school full time. This allowed for the recruitment of a new arts educator for the other school. An increase in arts education sections with lower class sizes and additional specialized arts opportunities have increased due to the Proposition 28 funding. This growth has also increased collaboration among staff members and is developing a greater sense of community within the arts department. Challenges at the secondary level include finding credentialed staffing and facility teaching space.

   Elementary and secondary schools, as well as the district wide preschool program through the Early Childhood Education department, have ordered materials, equipment and other resources for use in the increased or new arts education programs.

2. **Number of full-time equivalent teachers (certificated).** 13.7

3. **Number of full-time equivalent personnel (classified).** 2.0

4. **Number of full-time equivalent teaching aides.** 0

5. **Number of students served.** 493

6. **Number of school sites providing arts education.** 35

in a Service Order to serve in a lower rate or experience position than that for which they are qualified on Exhibit A so long as 1) the tasks they will perform are consistent with the tasks for which they are otherwise qualified and listed and 2) the rate charged is the rate applicable to the position in which they are performing services.

The addition, elimination, or re-categorization of Key Personnel addressed above may be approved by the District official executing this Agreement or their delegatee or replacement and shall not require approval of the District’s Board.

**ARTICLE 5. CHANGES IN BASIC SERVICES AND ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION**

Extension of the term of this Agreement solely to permit completion of a Service Order, as provided above, shall not require Board approval.

send to Consultant, copies of all notices and communications sent to or received by the District or Design Professional(s) relating to the Project(s).

ARTICLE 7. COMPENSATION AND PAYMENT

A. Compensation for Basic Services

1. The District shall provide the Consultant a standard template for invoicing (Exhibit K).

2. The District shall compensate the Consultant for performing the Basic Services described in Article 3, as limited by any Service Order. The Service Order shall specify at least the following: a) the names of the personnel to be performing the services, if identified by name, adjacent to the position they are filling; b) the positions that may be invoiced; c) the applicable hourly rate, not to exceed the rates set forth in Exhibit A, as they may be modified; d) the level of effort expected; and e) a maximum level of effort approved to be invoiced, absent prior written approval for a deviation. While certain positions may be identified solely by position, the Project Manager (and/or Senior Project Manager) and Field Engineer (and/or Senior Field Engineer) must be identified by name. The Service Order also shall specify a percentage of the final construction cost that the Consultant’s total cost will not exceed, which percentage shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the final construction cost for that Project unless specially approved by the Board due to unexpected changes.

B. Hourly Rate Increases: Hourly Rates bid and reflected on Exhibit A are fixed and shall not be subject to increase during the term of this Agreement except as follows. Annually, the District will consider whether unusual inflation or other cost of living increases warrant an increase in rates paid. If the District concludes that such an increase is appropriate, then a percentage increase will be recommended to the Board and, if approved, will apply to all Consultants in the District's pool of construction management contractors uniformly. If this Agreement is extended beyond its initial three-year term without an interim increase in rates, then the District will recommend that the Board approve a rate increase for the remainder of the Agreement term.

C. Personnel Changes: Exhibit A identifies certain key personnel by position and rate,
<!-- Page 38 -->
![Attachment 1](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+1)

and each Service Order shall identify the personnel to be used on any specific Project. Any change in position description for a listed individual that results in an increased rate, whether on Exhibit A or in a Service Order, and any addition of an unlisted individual at specified position, requires written request by Consultant, specifying the reason for the addition or position change, and prior written approval by the District. Invoiced amounts for an individual at a position for which the individual is not approved will be paid at no more than the highest approved rate.

D. Payment  
1. The Consultant will submit an invoice monthly to the District on a form to be provided by the District (Exhibit K). Invoices shall be segregated by each Project where the Consultant is working on more than one Project and shall detail the Basic Services provided, listing each employee of Consultant performing services, date services were performed, time for each day services were performed, and approved hourly rate.  
2. The District shall review the invoice promptly, shall identify any disputed items or items for which additional information is required, and shall approve undisputed items. The District shall make payment to the Consultant of one hundred percent (100%) of the approved invoiced amount within thirty (30) days of the District's approval of the invoice.  
3. Payments due to the Consultant that remain unpaid for more than sixty (60) days from the date of the Consultant’s approved invoice shall bear interest at the prevailing rate.

E. Accounting Records: Records of the Consultant's fees shall be maintained on the basis of generally-accepted accounting principles and shall be available for inspection by the District or the District's representative at mutually convenient times. Records shall include, but not be limited to, original timesheet records showing, by line items and the amount of time allocated to each project or task. Records supporting all fees invoiced to the District under this Agreement shall be maintained for at least two years after expiration of this Agreement or three years after completion of any Service Order issued hereunder, whichever is later.

F. Compensation for Additional Services: The Consultant shall be compensated and payments shall be made for performing approved Additional Services in the same manner as provided in Article 7 for Basic Services.

ARTICLE 8. INSURANCE AND MUTUAL INDEMNITY

A. The Consultant shall procure and maintain insurance on all of its operations during the term of this Agreement, with reliable insurance companies, on forms acceptable to District, for the following minimum insurance coverages:  
1. Workers' Compensation Insurance and occupational disease insurance, as required by law, and employer's liability insurance, with minimum limits of $1,000,000.

Insurance is to be placed with insurers approved by the State of California Department of Insurance and with a Best's rating of no less than (A-) Level VII. Required levels of insurance may be obtained for the full limits required by a combination of underlying policies with the balance provided by an excess or umbrella liability policy covering all workplaces involved in this Agreement.

3. The insurance shall cover all operations of Consultant, including but not limited to the following: (1) premises, operations and mobile equipment liability; (2) completed operations and products liability; (3) contractual liability; (4) Independent Contractor's Contingent coverages; (5) broad form property damage liability; (6) personal injury liability endorsement; and (7) automobile bodily injury and property damage insurance, including all owned, hired, and non-owned equipment.

4. All general liability policies shall name the District as an additional insured and shall provide that such policy is primary insurance.

5. The Consultant shall also provide Professional Liability Insurance for the Project, written on a "Claims Made Basis," with limits of liability not less than $2,000,000, including the Consultant and all persons for whose acts the Consultant may be liable, against any and all liabilities arising out of or in connection with the negligent acts, errors, or omissions of any of the foregoing in connection with the carrying out of their professional responsibilities under this Agreement. At the end of the term of this Agreement, the Consultant shall provide the District proof of professional liability insurance coverage for two years following expiration of the term of this Agreement. All such professional liability policies shall include an endorsement covering the indemnification provisions of Article 8(B).

6. The Consultant also shall provide Certificates of Insurance, Additional Insured Endorsement and, immediately upon demand, full copies of the policies to the District within ten (10) days after receipt by Consultant of a signed version of this Agreement. The certificates and endorsements shall provide that there will be no cancellation, reduction, or modification of coverage without thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the District.

7. There shall be no reduction or modification of coverage of insurance required by this Agreement without the prior written consent of the District.

8. The Consultant, as agent of the District, may be named as an additional insured in any insurance policy obtained by the District for the Project(s) for which the Consultant is providing construction management services, but only to the extent that the Consultant faces liability due to any actively negligent act, error, or omission by the District.

B. Indemnity

1. The Consultant shall, with respect to all work which is covered by or incidental to this Agreement or any Service Order issued hereunder, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the District and its employees, agents, and representatives (collectively the "Indemnitees") from and against any and all claims or damages asserted by firms or individuals claiming through the Consultant, and all claims, liability, loss, damage, costs, or expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert's fees, awards, fines, or judgments, arising by reason of any claim for compensation, the death or bodily injury to persons, injury to property, or other loss, damage, or expense, to the extent that any of the above are contributed to or caused by the negligent or intentional acts, errors, or omissions of the Consultant. The Consultant's duty shall include the duty to defend, as required by California Civil Code section 2778. However, the Consultant shall not be obligated under this Agreement to indemnify Indemnitee to the extent that the damage is caused by the active or sole negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnitee.

2. The District shall indemnify and hold harmless the Consultant and its employees, agents, and representatives from and against any and all claims, liability, loss, damage, costs, or expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert's fees, awards, fines, or judgments to the extent that any of the above are contributed to or caused solely or intentionally by the District's negligent acts, errors, or omissions in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement. The District's duty shall include the duty to defend, as required by California Civil Code section 2778. However, the District shall not be obligated under this Agreement to indemnify the Consultant to the extent that the damage is caused by the active or sole negligence or willful misconduct of the Consultant or its employees, agents, or representatives.

3. The Consultant and the District each agree promptly to serve notice on the other party of any claims arising hereunder, and shall cooperate in the defense of such claims.

4. The obligations of the Consultant under this Agreement are personal and not affected by the existence of any rights or obligations under any policy of insurance.

ARTICLE 9. TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION

A. Termination

1. This Agreement may be terminated, in whole or in part, in writing by either party in the event of substantial failure by the other party to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement through no fault of the terminating party, provided that no such termination may be effected unless the other party is given:

a) Written notification (delivered personally or by overnight mail by commercially-recognized carrier) that the other party is in material breach of the contract and specifying the breach.

b) Seven (7) calendar days to cure the breach.
<!-- Page 41 -->
![Attachment 1](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Attachment+1)

c) An opportunity for consultation with the terminating party prior to the termination.

d) Termination notification (delivered personally or by overnight mail by commercially-recognized carrier) that the breach has not been cured and providing an additional five (5) calendar days for the effective date of the termination.

2. In addition to the foregoing right to terminate for cause, the District has the absolute right to terminate this Agreement or any Service Order issued hereunder without cause, for any reason whatsoever, upon thirty (30) days’ written notice (delivered personally or by overnight mail by commercially-recognized carrier) to the Consultant. In the event of notice of such termination, the Consultant shall take reasonable measures to mitigate termination expenses.

3. If termination pursuant to Subparagraph 9.A.1 is effected by the District, the Consultant will be paid for work actually performed, less any costs or expenses reasonably incurred by the District as a result of the breach or termination. If termination pursuant to Section 9.A.2 is effected by the District, then the Consultant shall be entitled to payment of the Consultant for services satisfactorily rendered and approved, documented expenses incurred prior to the termination. In addition, the Consultant shall be paid unavoidable, reasonable expenses that are directly attributable to the termination.

4. Upon receipt of a termination notice pursuant to either Section 9.A.1 or 9.A.2, the Consultant shall (i) promptly discontinue all services affected (unless the notice provides otherwise), and (ii) deliver or otherwise make available to the District all data, documents, procedures, reports, estimates, summaries, and such other information and materials as may have been accumulated by the Consultant in performing this Agreement, whether completed or in process.

5. If, after termination of the Consultant under Section 9.A.1, it is determined that the Consultant was not in material breach of this Agreement, then the termination shall be deemed to have been effected under Section 9.A.2. In such event, adjustment for the compensation provided for in this Agreement shall be made as provided in Section 9.A.3 for termination under Section 9.A.2.

B. Suspension

1. The District may order the Consultant in writing to suspend all or any part of the Consultant’s Services for the convenience of the District or for work stoppage beyond the control of the District or the Consultant.

2. If Consultant's Services for a Project are suspended, then Consultant shall make good faith efforts to occupy personnel identified in the Service Order with other work, including Project work not suspended or other projects requiring additional support, during the period of the suspension. If, at any time after the Project has been suspended for at least two (2) weeks, Consultant is unable to occupy its personnel.

**ARTICLE 10. DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

A. **Direct Negotiation.** Direct Negotiation will be the initial process utilized by the parties after recognition of a potential claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Service Order. Either the District or Consultant may make a written request for Direct Negotiations promptly upon recognizing that a dispute exists related to performance of this Agreement or any Service Order issued hereunder. The request shall specify the background of the claim including nature and amount of the claim; the positions of both parties as understood by the claimant; a brief description of attempts to resolve it; and any other information relevant to resolving the dispute. Direct Negotiation representatives of the parties shall be the District’s designated representative and the Consultant’s designated representative, neither of whom shall have been materially involved with earlier attempts at resolution. Direct Negotiation will take place at the Project or at a mutually agreeable location, and the Direct Negotiations shall take place as soon as reasonably practical after the request for Direct Negotiation. The parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the claim, dispute, or other matter arising out of the Agreement. Each party shall document the results of the Direct Negotiation and these documents shall be exchanged between the parties.

B. **Notice of Claim.** Within three (3) business days after the meeting for Direct Negotiation, if Consultant believes that it still has a claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Service Order issued hereunder, Consultant shall give the District written notice of the claim and the event(s) giving rise to the claim. Said written notice shall specify the nature, amount and basis of the claim and shall be certified under penalty of perjury and in compliance with the California False Claims Act, as follows:

**CLAIM CERTIFICATION**

Under penalty of perjury, and with specific reference to the California False Claims Act, Government Code sections 12650, et seq., I certify that submission of the attached claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data prepared by the undersigned company is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that submission of the claim to Owner does not violate the California False Claims Act; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of claimant.

Dated:____________________  Company______________________

By_________________________  [Name and Title]
<!-- Page 43 -->
![Attachment 1](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png)

Signature

By submitting a claim with the foregoing certification, Consultant acknowledges that it has read and is familiar with the provisions of the California False Claims Act (California Government Code sections 12650 et seq.) and represents that submission of the claim does not in any respect violate the California False Claims Act. Failure to provide such certification shall constitute a waiver of the claim. Failure to provide notice of the claim within the time limit shall constitute grounds for rejection of the claim.

C. Mediation. The parties agree that all claims, disputes or controversies between the parties arising out of or relating to this agreement, or breach thereof, ("Claim") shall initially be submitted to non-binding mediation before a mediator mutually agreed upon by the parties. In the event the parties are unable to agree upon the identity of the mediator within fifteen (15) days from the date that either party submits a written request to mediate a Claim, the mediator shall be selected and the mediation administered under the Construction Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The costs and fees of the mediator shall be paid equally by the parties. The parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to reach an agreement with respect to the Claim. Neither party shall commence or pursue arbitration or litigation until the completion of mediation proceedings.

D. Arbitration. Except as otherwise stated herein, if a Claim remains unresolved after mediation, then the Claim shall be decided by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator. The claim in arbitration shall be decided under and in accordance with the laws of California, including laws related to arbitrations, supported by substantial evidence and, in writing, contain the basis for the decision, findings of fact, and conclusions of law. Upon a petition to confirm, correct, or vacate any award, a court shall vacate the award, or part thereof, if it determines either that the award, or part thereof, is not supported by substantial evidence or that it is not decided under or in accordance with the laws of California. If the award, or part thereof, is vacated or if the court determines that the award does not include a determination of all submitted questions necessary to determine the controversy, the court may order a rehearing before the original arbitrator or remand to the original arbitrator that portion of the dispute which the court concludes the arbitrator failed to determine. The hearing in any arbitration under this provision shall be held in Sacramento County. The cost of the arbitration shall be borne equally, but the arbitrator may award the prevailing party its costs and necessary disbursements on the same basis as is allowed in civil actions. In the event of any dispute between the District and the Design Professional and/or the Construction Contractor that also involves claims related to the Consultant, Consultant agrees to participate in the same claims resolution proceedings as those involving the District and the Design Professional and/or the Construction Contractor.

ARTICLE 11. FINGERPRINTING

A. Education Code Section 45125.1 shall apply to this Agreement and fingerprinting is required of Consultant and/or its employees for all Service Orders issued under this Agreement. Consultant must submit completed Exhibits D, E, and F before being eligible for
<!-- Page 44 -->
![Attachment 1](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+1)

receipt of any Service Order hereunder. The following shall apply:

The Consultant shall, prior to commencement of work pursuant to this Agreement, require any person affiliated with the Consultant (or, in appropriate cases, him or herself) to be fingerprinted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) if that person will have unsupervised access to school campuses. Upon verification from DOJ that those persons fingerprinted have no record of a serious or violent felony, the Consultant will so certify by signing and submitting the Consultant Certification attached as Exhibit D and incorporated by reference. In addition, the Consultant shall submit the names of those persons who have received clearance and are authorized to have unsupervised access to school campuses on a form as indicated in Exhibit E. Any person whose name is not on the cleared list may not have such access. In that case, the Consultant must make arrangements with the District for appropriate access. No person with a violent or serious felony as reported by DOJ may have access to the school campuses.

B. Failure to comply with this provision, or permitting unsupervised access by an employee whose name has not been cleared by DOJ as certified by the Consultant, shall constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 12. AWARD OF SERVICE ORDERS

By award of this Agreement, the District does not commit to award any level of services to the Consultant. Further, the District reserves the right to award any Service Order without further proposals or other competition to any consultant in the District's pool, or to award a contract for a Project to a consultant outside of the pool if necessary in the District’s sole and absolute discretion.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the District's general intent is to seek two or more proposals from qualified consultants in the District's pool at the time of selecting a consultant for a Service Order for specific Projects. The District may limit the consultants from which it requests proposals based on established experience and the needs of the Project or other anticipated or concurrent projects.

For Projects of $10 million or less, unless the Project involves specialized construction or expertise that the District wants to evaluate, the District anticipates that any “proposals” will be informal and primarily based on the information in the Service Order, including proposed personnel and levels of effort. For award of Projects with an anticipated construction cost over $10 million, the District may seek more formal proposals and/or proposals from more qualified consultants than for smaller projects. For any Project for which personnel are not committed full time to the Project, the District may require Consultant to identify in its proposal any other projects for which the personnel are performing services.

ARTICLE 13. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

A. Confidentiality: The Consultant shall not disclose or permit the disclosure of any information designated by the District as confidential, except to its agents, employees, and other consultants who need such confidential information in order to properly perform their
<!-- Page 45 -->

**Duties relative to this Agreement.**

**B. Limitations and Assignment**

1. The District and the Consultant each binds itself and its successors and assigns to the terms of this Agreement.

2. Neither the District nor the Consultant shall assign or transfer its interest in this Agreement without the written consent of the other, except that the Consultant may assign accounts receivable to a commercial bank for securing loans without approval of the District.

**C. Governing Law:** Unless otherwise provided, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California.

**D. Extent of Agreement:** This Agreement, including its Exhibits which are made a part of the Agreement and incorporated in full herein and any Service Order which may be issued hereunder, represents the entire and integrated agreement between the District and the Consultant and supersedes all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements, either written or oral.

**E. Amendment:** This Agreement may be amended only by written instrument signed by both the District and the Consultant, by officials having authority equal to or greater than that of the officials signing this Agreement. Signature by the District Board, and no signature requiring such approval shall be valid and binding on the District without the required approval. Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to benefit any third party.

**F. Severability:** If any provision of this Agreement or any Service Order issued hereunder is determined by a proper court to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect without such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision(s) provided that the severance of such provision(s) does not result in a material failure of consideration under this Agreement to either Consultant or the District.

**G. Mutual Waiver of Consequential Damages:** Except to the extent of any available insurance coverage, neither the Consultant nor the District shall be liable for consequential or incidental damages, even if notification has been given as to the possibility of such damages, except to the extent that the potential liability for such damages arises from violation of intellectual property rights of a third party and/or from the indemnification obligation herein if such damages are awarded to a third-party.

**H. Meaning of Terms:** References made in the singular shall include the plural and the masculine shall include the feminine or the neuter.

**I. Notice:** All notices required by this Agreement shall be deemed given on the day received when made in writing and delivered personally or by overnight mail by commercially-recognized carrier (such as FedEx), addressed to the individuals signing below at the address.

b) Contractor Initiated Changes: Should the Contractor believe that conditions have changed or that it has been directed to do additional work requiring a change in time or cost, the Contractor may submit to the Consultant a proposed change order delineating the changed conditions along with the cost and/or time impact. The Consultant will review the proposed change order and either agree with the asserted change, send the proposed change order back to the Contractor for correction or additional documentation, or reject it. If the Consultant agrees with the asserted change, then the Consultant shall proceed with authorizing the Contractor to perform the changed work pursuant to the procedures for District initiated changes described above and in the Construction Contract.

c) DSA approval may be required for changed work. The Consultant will review proposed changes with the Design Professional to determine whether DSA approval is required. If DSA approval is required, then the Consultant will direct the Contractor how to proceed after the Consultant receives appropriate direction from the Design Professional. The Consultant is not responsible for processing the requests to DSA for approval but is responsible for processing the change order or directive to the Contractor with all appropriate documentation and any required approvals.

d) The Consultant shall verify that changed work and adjustments of time, if any, required by approved change orders or directives have been incorporated into the Contractor's construction schedule.

2. Cost Records: In instances when the work described in a request for a proposal, construction change directive or change order is performed on a time and material basis, the Consultant shall obtain on a daily basis from the Contractor Daily Extra Work Reports recording the labor for each day work is performed pursuant to such proposed change order, construction change directive, or change order.

# CERTIFICATION REGARDING RUSSIAN SANCTIONS –  
to be submitted with Bid Proposal form

On March 4, 2022, Governor Gavin Newsom issued Executive Order N-6-22 regarding Economic Sanctions against Russia and Russian entities and individuals. “Economic Sanctions” hereunder refers to sanctions imposed by the United States government in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, as those sanctions may be updated from time to time, as well as any sanctions imposed under state law. By its signature below, the contractor represents that it is not a target of Economic Sanctions.

Should the District determine that the Bidder is a target of Economic Sanctions or is conducting prohibited transactions with sanctioned individuals or entities, that shall be grounds for rejection of the Contractor’s bid/proposal for lack of responsibility any time prior to contract execution, or, if determined after contract execution, shall be grounds for termination for default by the District. Should the District determine that any of the Bidder’s subcontractors listed in accordance with Public Contract Code section 4104 is a target of Economic Sanctions or is conducting prohibited transactions with sanctioned individuals or entities, then, at the District’s discretion, that shall be grounds for rejection of the Contractor’s bid/proposal (if prior to award) or for required substitution of the sanctioned subcontractor, subject to the requirements of Public Contract Code section 4107, with the Contractor to bear all costs of replacing the non-responsible subcontractor.

I, the official named below, declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct and that this certification is executed on __________ at ________________, California.

**AGENDA ITEM:** G.8  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**MEETING DATE:** 08/27/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Extending A-E Master Agreement For Architectural Services (RFP #20-101)  

**DEPARTMENT:** Operations  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt Resolution No. 4150, approving extending RFP# 20-101 Architectural Services Master Agreement to allow completion of existing projects service orders.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The Master Agreements have an expiration date of September 1, 2024, but there are several projects awarded under the Master Agreements that are currently in design or construction and where the project completion will extend beyond September 1, 2024. At the time the projects were awarded, the District did not have its new master agreements, awarded earlier this year, in place to award the projects under those agreements. Because of this, we will need to extend the Master Agreements for which projects will not be complete by September 1. The affected A-E firms have agreed to the extension under the terms of the Master Agreements. This extension will allow our A-E firms to complete their projects under the originally awarded Master Agreements and allow a reasonable cushion should the projects experience delay. No new projects will be awarded under the extended Master Agreements.  

This is applicable to the following A-E Firms:  
- Derivi Castellanos Architects  
- Jordan Knighton Architects, Inc.  
- KMM Services  
- Lionakis  
- Nacht & Lewis Architects, Inc.  
- PBK/WLC Architects, Inc.  
- Rainforth Grau Architects, Inc.

# RESOLUTION NO. 4150

## RESOLUTION BEFORE THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION EXTENDING MASTER AGREEMENTS FOR ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING SERVICES TO ALLOW COMPLETION OF EXISTING PROJECT SERVICE ORDERS

WHEREAS, on or about September 16, 2019 the San Juan Unified School District (“District”) awarded master agreements for architectural and engineering services (“Master Agreements”) to a pool of firms pursuant to Request for Proposals # 20-101 (“RFP”), with specific projects awarded to selected firms pursuant to Service Orders issued thereunder; and

WHEREAS, the Master Agreements will expire by their terms, unless extended, on September 1, 2024; and

WHEREAS, under the Master Agreements, the District has awarded firms in the pool numerous Service Orders where the projects will not be complete by September 1, 2024, a list of which projects with anticipated completion dates is attached hereto as Attachment 1; and

WHEREAS, it is in the District’s best interest for purposes of project continuity and fiscal responsibility to continue the projects under existing Service Orders issued under the Master Agreements until the projects are complete; and

WHEREAS, each firm that has been awarded a Service Order listed on Attachment 1 has agreed to an extension of the Master Agreement to allow completion of all Service Orders by their terms; and

WHEREAS, new projects will be awarded under new master agreements awarded earlier this year, so that the scope of any Master Agreement extension is limited to existing Service Orders; and

WHEREAS, the date of completion of each project is not precise, in part because it is impacted by the speed with which the contractor completes the project close-out process, but can be reasonably anticipated.

NOW, THEREFORE, the San Juan Unified School District Board of Education does hereby resolve as follows:

### Section 1.
The foregoing recitals are hereby adopted as true and correct.

### Section 2.
The Board approves amendments extending the Master Agreements, solely for purposes of completing existing projects under existing Service Orders, as follows:

2. A/E shall conform its design work with Owner’s storm water requirements, as indicated above, that are approved by Owner and applicable to the Project at no additional cost to Owner. In addition, as required, A/E shall develop a grading and drainage plan and a site plan from architectural information showing a final development of the site. This drawing will also include a horizontal and vertical control plan and a utility infrastructure plan. The Services described in this Article 3.D shall be provided by a professional civil engineer who contracts with or is an employee of A/E. Owner, at its sole discretion, may pay A/E for Extra Services to comply with this provision if the Services required are in excess of those normally required for services of the type in this Agreement.

E. Bid/Solicitation and Award Phase

1. A/E shall assist Owner during bid/solicitation and award phase as follows:

   a) Attendance at and participation in pre-bid/pre-solicitation meetings;
<!-- Page 142 -->

2. A/E shall administer the Construction Phase, as required by this Agreement, the Contract Documents, the Service Order and the applicable statutes and regulations. Its communications shall be in the format set forth in Exhibit H hereto, Project Management Internet Communication Requirements. A/E shall comply with all time lines set forth in the Contract Documents for its Construction Phase services. A/E shall observe and become familiar with the general quality of construction and report in writing to Owner any instance where the materials, workmanship or the general quality of construction is not in conformance with the plans and specifications, building code requirements or generally accepted industry standards of quality.

3. In providing services during the Construction Phase, A/E shall employ individuals on the Project to whom Owner has no reasonable objection. In the event Owner has a reasonable objection to any employee of A/E performing work at the Project, it shall notify A/E, which shall promptly cause the individual to be removed from the Project.

4. A/E, as a representative of Owner, shall make periodic visits to the site to render architectural observations to: (1) become generally familiar with and to keep Owner informed about the progress and quality of the portion of the work completed, (2) endeavor to guard Owner against defects and deficiencies in the work, and (3) determine, in general, if the work is being performed in a manner indicating that the work, when fully completed, will be in accordance with the Contract Documents. A/E shall attend on-site construction meetings at least once per week and shall otherwise be available to Owner and the inspector for site meetings on an “as-needed” basis. Refer to Exhibit E or the Service Order for the minimum amount of meetings required for the Project.

The minimum hours to be spent at the site during the Construction Phase are anticipated to be as follows, subject to revision, depending on the delivery method for construction services and/or as set forth in the Service Order:

| Role                     | Hours |
|--------------------------|-------|
| Architect                | TBD   |
| Mechanical Engineer       | TBD   |
| Electrical Engineer       | TBD   |

These hours constitute a “pool” of hours available to the Owner, and the Owner or its representative can call on the A/E as needed for additional site visits within the available pool of hours. Any unused hours within a month will roll over into the following month.

However, A/E shall not be required to make exhaustive continuous on-site inspections to check the quality or quantity of the work. A/E shall neither have control over nor charge of, nor be responsible for, the construction means, methods, techniques, sequences or procedures or for safety precautions and programs in connection with the work, since these are solely Contractor's rights and responsibilities under the Contract Documents.

5. A/E shall make regular reports as may be required by applicable state agencies; review submittals and shop drawings for compliance with design intent; review RFI's and promptly issue responses; review requests for substitution of materials, equipment and the laboratory reports thereof; assist in the preparation of change orders in a format acceptable to the Division of the State Architect for written approval of Owner; provide a color schedule of all materials in the Project for Owner’s review and approval; assist in determining date of final completion; make final review of the Project; review written guarantees, instruction books, diagrams and charts required of the Contractor; issue A/E’s certificate of completion and final certificate for payment and provide all close-out documentation required by applicable state agencies, as well as as-built (record) documents within sixty (60) days of A/E’s certificate of completion.

6. A/E shall review Contractor's applications for payment and certify the amounts due Contractor and shall issue certificates for payment in such amounts. A/E’s certification for payment shall constitute a representation to Owner based on A/E’s evaluation of the work and on the data comprising Contractor’s application for payment that the work has progressed to the point indicated and that, to the best of the A/E’s knowledge, information and belief, the quality of the work is in accordance with the Contract Documents.

7. A/E shall interpret, advise Owner and Contractor and decide matters concerning the Contract Documents or performance of Owner and Contractor under the requirements of the Contract Documents on written request of either Owner or Contractor. A/E’s response to such requests shall be made with reasonable promptness and within any time limits agreed upon or set forth in the Contract Documents. Interpretations and decisions of the A/E shall be consistent with the intent of and reasonably inferable from the Contract Documents and shall be in writing or in the form of drawings. When making such interpretations and decisions, A/E shall endeavor to secure faithful performance by both Owner and Contractor and shall not show partiality to either.

   i) Owner may believe that A/E’s work under this Agreement is connected with errors or omissions or problems related to a claim. As a result, and upon notice of same by Owner, A/E’s payment for these Extra Services may be held in suspense by Owner, at Owner’s sole discretion, until final determination in accordance with Article 20 of this Agreement or by a court of law or arbitration of the proportion that A/E’s fault bears to the fault of all parties concerned.

   ii) Such amounts in suspense, proportionate to the final determination that A/E’s fault bears to the fault of all parties concerned, shall not be paid to A/E. However, the remainder of any such amounts in suspense shall be paid to A/E after a final determination in accordance with Article 20 of this Agreement or by a court of law or arbitration is made and A/E submits a proper invoice to Owner, which shall be paid in accordance with Owner’s normal and customary practice of payment of A/E’s invoices under this Agreement.

   c) Nothing in this paragraph 8, including its subparagraphs, of Article 3.F shall in any way limit Owner’s rights and remedies under this Agreement against A/E for any errors or omissions or breaches of any kind related to this Agreement and/or A/E’s responsibilities under it.

9. A/E, as part of its Basic Services, will perform a follow-up review and prepare a written report for Owner on apparent deficiencies in construction not later than one (1) month prior to the expiration of the General Construction Contract guarantee period of the Project.

A. A/E Default: A/E shall be in default if A/E at any time refuses or neglects to prosecute its work in a timely fashion or in accordance with the Project schedule; is adjudicated as bankrupt; commits any act of insolvency; makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors without Owner’s consent; or fails to make prompt payment to persons furnishing labor, equipment or materials; fails in any respect to properly and diligently prosecute its work; becomes delinquent with respect to contributions or payments required to be made to any employee benefit programs or trust; or otherwise fails to perform fully any and all of the agreements herein contained.

B. Cure: If A/E fails to cure the default within seven (7) days after written notice thereof, Owner may, at its sole option, take possession of any documents, files (including electronic files) and other materials prepared or used by A/E in connection with the Project(s) and provide any such work, labor or materials to another design professional as may be necessary to overcome the default and deduct the cost thereof from any money then due or thereafter to become due to A/E under a Service Order issued under this Agreement.

C. Default Termination: In the event Owner elects to terminate a Service Order or this Agreement due to A/E default, Owner shall have the right to immediate possession of all plans, specifications and other work in progress prepared by A/E, whether located at the Project, at A/E’s place of business or at the offices of a sub-consultant, and may employ any other person or persons to finish the Basic Services and provide the materials therefore. In case of such default termination, A/E shall not be entitled to receive any further payment under a Service Order issued under this Agreement until the Project is completely finished.

Owner Default: A/E may terminate a Service Order issued under this Agreement for cause upon seven (7) days written notice to Owner for any of the following reasons: (1) Owner fails to timely pay undisputed sums due to A/E; (2) Owner assigns this Agreement or Service Order or transfers ownership of the Project prior to completion of A/E’s services under the Service Order if the assignment or transfer is made without the prior written consent of A/E; or (3) Owner suspends the Project or A/E’s services for more than 180 consecutive days. Owner shall have the right to cure the stated ground for termination within the seven (7) day notice period; and in the event of cure, A/E’s notice shall become null and of no further force or effect.

E. Termination for Convenience. In addition to the foregoing right to terminate for default, Owner reserves the absolute right to terminate this Agreement and/or any Service Order issued hereunder without cause, for any reason whatsoever, upon seven (7) days written notice to A/E. In the event of such a termination without cause, Owner shall have the right to immediate possession of all plans, specifications and other work in progress prepared by A/E, whether located at the Project, at A/E’s place of business or at the offices of a sub-consultant, and may

**ARTICLE 19. OWNERSHIP OF DOCUMENTS AND RE-USE OF DOCUMENTS**

A. Owner acknowledges that the A/E construction documents, including electronic files, are instruments of professional service. Nonetheless, the plans, specifications, estimates, programs, reports, models and other material prepared by or on behalf of A/E under this Agreement and any Service Order issued hereunder (collectively the “Documents”) shall be and remain the property of Owner, pursuant to Section 17316 of the Education Code, whether the Project is completed or not. All Documents shall be delivered to Owner on the earlier of (1) sixty (60) days after Owner’s Notice of Completion of the Project or (2) the date of termination of this Agreement or Service Order for any reason prior to final completion of the Project. The Documents may be reproduced and/or used by Owner and its agents, employees, representatives and assigns, in whole or in part, or in modified form, for all purposes Owner may deem advisable in connection with completion and maintenance of, and additions, modifications to, or modernizations of the Project, without further employment of or payment of any compensation to A/E; provided, however, that if this Agreement or Service Order is terminated for any reason prior to completion of the Project and if under such circumstances Owner uses, or engages the services of and directs another A/E to use, the Documents to complete the Project, Owner agrees to release A/E from any responsibility for the conformance of the incomplete portions of the Project to the Documents and to hold A/E harmless from any and all liability, costs, expenses and reasonable legal fees and disbursements, relative to claims arising out of matters and/or events which occur subsequent to the termination of this Agreement or Service Order as a result of causes other than the fault or negligence of A/E or anyone for whose acts it is responsible.

B. Except as otherwise permitted in this Agreement or any Service Order issued hereunder, Owner shall not assign, delegate, sublicense, pledge or otherwise transfer the right to use and re-use the Documents to any other party without the prior written authorization of A/E. However, in addition to the rights to use and re-use the Documents as set forth in this Article 19, Owner shall be permitted to authorize design-builders, lease-leaseback providers, Contractors or any construction subcontractors, equipment suppliers or material suppliers to use and reproduce, to the fullest extent necessary, applicable portions of the Documents appropriate to and for use in their work.

C. In the event Owner desires to construct all or part of another wholly unrelated project, which would be essentially identical in design to the Project that is the subject of a Service Order, A/E agrees to permit re-use of its design and the corresponding contract documents, subject to payment to A/E of a fair and reasonable re-use fee.

D. Any unauthorized re-use of the Documents shall be at Owner’s sole risk and without liability to A/E. Owner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless A/E and its sub-consultants against any damages, liabilities or costs, including reasonable legal fees and disbursements, arising from the unauthorized re-use or modification of the Documents. Submission or distribution of the Documents to meet official regulatory requirements or for similar purposes does not constitute an unauthorized re-use of the Documents.

San Juan Unified School District A/E Agreement – 9/10/19  
Page 23 of 28  
159
<!-- Page 160 -->
E. A/E shall not re-use the Documents without the prior written consent of Owner. Any unauthorized re-use of the Documents by A/E shall be at A/E’s sole risk and without liability to Owner. A/E agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Owner against any damages, liabilities or costs, including reasonable legal fees and disbursements arising from the unauthorized re-use of the Documents.

ARTICLE 20. NOTICE OF CLAIMS AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

A. A/E shall give written notice of any claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Service Order issued hereunder within seventy-two (72) hours of the event(s) giving rise to the claim. Said written notice shall specify the nature, amount and basis of the claim and shall be certified under penalty of perjury and in compliance with the California False Claims Act, as set forth below. Failure to include these required certifications shall constitute grounds for rejection of the claim. Failure to provide notice of the claim within the time limit set forth herein shall constitute grounds for rejection of the claim.

B. Direct Negotiation will be the initial process utilized by the parties after issuance of written notice of any claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or Service Order as specified immediately above. Either the Owner or A/E may make a request for Direct Negotiations as an initial attempt to resolve any claim, dispute or other matter arising out of this Agreement or Service Order. Direct Negotiation representatives of the parties shall be the Owner’s designated representative and the A/E’s designated representative. Any requested Direct Negotiation will take place at the Project or at a mutually agreeable location specified by the parties’ designated representatives, and the Direct Negotiations shall take place as soon as reasonably practical after the request for Direct Negotiation. The parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the claim, dispute or other matter arising out of the Agreement. Each party shall document the results of the Direct Negotiation and these documents shall be exchanged between the parties.

C. Mediation. The parties agree that all claims, disputes or controversies between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any Service Order, or breach thereof, initially shall be submitted to non-binding mediation before a mediator mutually agreed upon by the parties. In the event the parties are unable to agree upon the identity of the mediator within fifteen days (15) from the date either party submits a written request to mediate a claim, dispute or controversy, the mediator shall be selected; and the mediation administered under the Construction Mediation Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The costs and fees of the mediator shall be paid equally by the parties. The parties shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to reach an agreement with respect to the claim, dispute or controversy. Neither party shall commence or pursue arbitration or litigation until the completion of mediation proceedings.

D. Arbitration. In the event that a claim remains unresolved after mediation, the claim may, but need not be, decided by binding arbitration. The hearing in any arbitration or any judicial proceeding shall be held in Sacramento County.

E. It is expressly agreed that no mediation or arbitration shall be initiated prior to the completion of the Project or termination of this Agreement or the Service Order, whichever is earlier.

<!-- Page 161 -->
F. Claim certification: A/E acknowledges that it has read and is familiar with the provisions of the California False Claims Act (California Government Code sections 12650 et seq.). Submission by A/E of a claim (as the term "claim" is defined in the False Claims Act) to Owner in connection with a Project, whether on its behalf or on behalf of a sub-consultant, shall constitute a representation by A/E to Owner that submission of the claim does not in any respect violate the California False Claims Act. Any party with an interest in the claim, including any sub-consultant(s), shall certify under penalty of perjury the validity and accuracy of any claim submitted to Owner, as stated within this article. Compliance with this claims certification requirement shall be a condition precedent to any obligation Owner might otherwise have to review the claim, and failure to provide such certification shall constitute a waiver of the claim. The claim certification required by this paragraph shall provide as follows:

CLAIM CERTIFICATION

Under penalty of perjury, and with specific reference to the California False Claims Act, Government Code sections 12650, et seq., I certify that submission of the attached claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data prepared by the undersigned company is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that submission of the claim to Owner does not violate the California False Claims Act; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of claimant.

C. In no event shall A/E’s cost to defend exceed A/E’s proportionate percentage of fault. However, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, in the event one or more defendants are unable to pay their share of defense costs due to bankruptcy or dissolution of the business, A/E shall meet and confer with the other parties regarding the unpaid defense costs.

D. Owner shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless A/E, its officers, directors, employees and sub-consultants (collectively “A/E”) from and against any and all claims, liability, loss, damage, costs or expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, experts’ fees, awards, fines or judgments, to the extent caused by Owner’s negligent acts, errors or omissions in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement or any Service Order issued hereunder. Owner’s duty shall include the duty to defend the indemnitees as required by Civil Code section 2778.

E. A/E and Owner each agree to promptly serve notice on the other party of any claims arising hereunder, and shall cooperate in the defense of any such claims.

F. The acceptance by Owner or its representatives of any certificate of insurance providing for coverage of any kind shall in no event be deemed a waiver of any of the provisions of this Article 22.

ARTICLE 23. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS  
A. The furnishing of available as-built drawings of existing structures is the responsibility of Owner.

The District administrator initiating and/or responsible for this Agreement shall, pursuant to section 45125.1 and District policy and guidelines, determine whether fingerprinting is required of A/E and/or its employees prior to issuing any Service Order. Once such determination is made, the administrator shall verify his/her determination on the signature page of the Service Order. If the Administrator concludes fingerprinting is required, the following shall apply:  
A. The A/E shall, prior to commencement of work pursuant to the Service Order, require any person affiliated with A/E (or, in appropriate cases, him or herself) to be fingerprinted by the Department of Justice (DOJ) if that person will have unsupervised access to school campuses. Upon verification from DOJ that those persons fingerprinted have no record of a serious or violent felony, A/E will so certify by signing and submitting the A/E Certification attached as Exhibit E and incorporated by reference. In addition, A/E shall submit the names of those persons who have received clearance and are authorized to have unsupervised access to school campuses on a form as indicated in Exhibit F. Any person whose name is not on the cleared list may not have such access. In that case, A/E must make arrangements with District for appropriate access.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
**AGENDA ITEM:** 1.2  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**MEETING DATE:** 08/27/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Development of Legislative Priorities and Advocacy Strategies (Thigpen) - 7:45 p.m.  

**DEPARTMENT:** Labor Relations and Government Affairs  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Discussion: The superintendent is recommending that the board discuss staff's recommendation on the development of legislative priorities and advocacy strategies.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Since the fall of 2022, San Juan Unified’s government affairs program has advanced the interests of district students, staff, and families by building collaborative relationships with federal, state, and local elected leaders, agencies, advocates and others whose partnerships and support are necessary to create conditions that foster student achievement. As one of the top 10 largest school districts in California, San Juan Unified is uniquely positioned to help influence and strengthen public policy that impacts our school communities by playing a more active role in the decision-making process at all levels of government.  

In preparation for the upcoming legislative cycle beginning in January 2025, district staff recommend that, later this fall, the board adopt a set of overarching legislative priorities that shall guide staff when considering whether to take any official district positions or implement advocacy strategies related to proposed legislation.  

The purpose of tonight's presentation is to share initial district staff recommendations, and receive board input and direction, on the following:  
- the creation of a policy that defines the board's role in setting legislative priorities, and authorizes the superintendent or designee to engage in advocacy activities aligned with those board-adopted priorities  
- recommended next steps and a tentative timeline for adoption of board policy and legislative priorities
