## Board Policy Manual

### Bylaw 9270: Conflict Of Interest 
**Status:** ADOPTED  
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992  
**Last Revised Date:** 09/13/2022  
**Last Reviewed Date:** 09/13/2022  

The Governing Board desires to maintain the highest ethical standards and help ensure that decisions are made in the best interest of the district and the public. No board member, district employee, or other person in a designated position shall participate in the making of any decision for the district when the decision will or may be affected by their financial, family, or other personal interest or consideration.

In accordance with law, board members shall disclose any conflict of interest and, as necessary, shall abstain from participating in the decision.

Even if a prohibited conflict of interest does not exist, a board member shall abstain from voting on personnel matters that uniquely affect their relatives. However, a board member may vote on collective bargaining agreements and personnel matters that affect a class of employees to which their relative belongs. Relative means an adult who is related to the board member by blood or affinity within the third degree, as determined by the common law, or an individual in an adoptive relationship within the third degree. (Education Code section 35107(e)) A relationship within the third degree includes an individual's parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, children, grandchildren, great- grandchildren, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and the similar family of the individual's spouse/registered domestic partner unless the individual is widowed or divorced.

The board shall adopt a conflict of interest code that incorporates the provisions of 2 CCR 18730 by reference, specifies the district’s designated positions, and provides the disclosure categories required for each position. The conflict of interest code shall be submitted to the district’s code reviewing body for approval, in accordance with Government Code section 87303 and within the deadline for submission established by the code reviewing body. (Government Code section 87303)

Upon direction by the code reviewing body, the board shall review the district's conflict of interest code and submit any changes to the code reviewing body, or if no change is required, the board shall submit a written statement to that effect. (Government Code section 87306.5)

When a change in the district's conflict of interest code is necessitated due to changed circumstances, such as the creation of new designated positions, changes to the duties assigned to existing positions, amendments, or revisions, the amended code shall be submitted to the code reviewing body within 90 days after the changed circumstances necessitating the amendments.

have become apparent. (Government Code section 87306)

When reviewing and preparing the district's conflict of interest code, the superintendent or designee shall provide officers, employees, consultants, and members of the community adequate notice and a fair opportunity to present their views. (Government Code section 87311)

Board members and designated employees shall annually file a Statement of Economic Interest/Form 700 in accordance with the disclosure categories specified in the district's conflict of interest code. A board member who leaves office or a designated employee who leaves district employment shall, within 30 days, file a revised statement covering the period of time between the closing date of the last statement and the date of leaving office or district employment. (Government Code sections 87302, 87302.6)

## Conflict of Interest under the Political Reform Act

A district official, including a board member, designated employee, or other person in a designated position shall not make, participate in making, or in any way use or attempt to use their official position to influence a governmental decision in which they know or have reason to know that they have a disqualifying conflict of interest. A disqualifying conflict of interest exists if the decision will have a "reasonably foreseeable material financial effect," which is distinguishable from the effect on the public generally, on the board member, designated employee, or other person in a designated position, their immediate family, or any financial interest described in 2 CCR 18700. (Government Code sections 87100, 87101, 87103; 2 CCR 18700-18707)

A board member, designated employee, or other person in a designated position makes a governmental decision when, acting within the authority of their office or position, they authorize or direct any action on a matter, vote, or provide information or opinion on it, contact, or appear before a district official for the purpose of affecting the decision, or takes any other action specified in 2 CCR 18704.

However, a board member shall participate in the making of a contract in which they have a financial interest if their participation is required by the rule of necessity or legally required participation pursuant to Government Code section 87101 and 2 CCR 18705. A district official makes a governmental decision when, within the authority of the office or position, the district official authorizes or directs any action on a matter, votes or provides information or opinion on it, contacts or appears before another district official for the purpose of affecting the decision, or takes any other action specified in 2 CCR 18704.

However, a district official shall participate in the making of a contract in which the district official has a financial interest if such participation is required by the rule of necessity or legally required participation pursuant to Government Code 87101 and 2 CCR 18705.

Conflict of Interest from Campaign Contributions  
To avoid improper influence over the board's decision-making involving the issuance of a license, permit, or other entitlements for use, including a contract, district officers, which includes board members or agency heads, shall comply with Government Code section 84308, including the following: (Government Code section 84308)

1. A district officer is prohibited from accepting, soliciting, or directing a contribution of more than $250 from any party or participant to a proceeding involving a license, permit, or other entitlement for use, including a contract, or from that person’s agent, while the proceeding is pending before the board and for 12 months following the date a final decision is rendered in the proceeding, if the board member knows or has reason to know that the party or participant has a financial interest in the board's decision.

2. Any district officer who received a contribution of more than $250 from a party or participant in the preceding 12 months shall disclose that fact on the record of the proceeding prior to the board rendering a decision in the proceeding. If the district officer willfully or knowingly received the contribution and knows or has reason to know that the participant has a financial interest in the board's decision, the district officer shall not make, participate in making, or in any way attempt to use the official position to influence the board's decision.

3. A district officer who receives a contribution that would otherwise require disqualification as described in Item #2 above may participate in the proceeding if the contribution is returned within 30 days from the time the district officer knows or should have known about the contribution and the proceeding.

4. A district officer who unknowingly accepts, solicits, or directs a contribution of more than $250 during the 12 months after the date of the board's final decision on the proceeding may cure the violation by returning the contribution, or the portion exceeding $250, within 14 days of accepting, soliciting, or directing the contribution, provided the district officer did not knowingly or willfully accept, solicit, or direct the prohibited contribution. The district officer shall maintain records of curing the violation.

The provisions in Government Code section 84308 as specified above do not apply to labor contracts, competitively bid contracts, and personal employment contracts. (Government Code section 84308)

Conflict of Interest under Government Code section 1090 - Financial Interest in a Contract  
Board members, employees, or district consultants shall not be financially interested in any contract made by the board on behalf of the district, including in the development, preliminary discussions, negotiations, compromises, planning, reasoning, and specifications and solicitations for bids. If a board member has such a financial interest in a contract made by the board, the contract is void. (Government Code section 1090)

<!-- Page 34 -->
Board members who willfully fail to disclose a remote interest in a contract may be subject to a fine or imprisonment pursuant to Government Code section 1097.

A board member shall not be considered to be financially interested in a contract in which they have only a "remote interest," as specified in Government Code section 1091, if the remote interest is disclosed during a board meeting and noted in the official board minutes. The affected board member shall not vote or debate on the matter or attempt to influence any other board member or district official to enter into the contract. (Government Code section 1091)

A board member shall not be considered to be financially interested in a contract in which their interest is a "noninterest" as defined in Government Code section 1091.5. Noninterest includes a board member's interest in being reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties, in the employment of their spouse/registered domestic partner who has been a district employee for at least one year prior to the board member's election or appointment, or in any other applicable circumstance specified in Government Code section 1091.5.

**Common Law Doctrine Against Conflict of Interest**  
A board member shall abstain from any official action in which their private or personal interest may conflict with their official duties.

**Incompatible Offices and Activities**  
Board members shall not engage in any employment or activity or hold any office which is inconsistent with, incompatible with, in conflict with, or inimical to the board member's duties as an officer of the district. (Government Code sections 1099, 1126)

**Gifts**  
Board members and designated employees may accept gifts only under the conditions and limitations specified in Government Code section 89503 and 2 CCR 18730.

The limitation on gifts does not apply to wedding gifts and gifts exchanged between individuals on birthdays, holidays, and other similar occasions, provided that the gifts exchanged are not substantially disproportionate in value. (Government Code section 89503) In addition, the limitation on gifts does not apply to informational materials such as books, reports, pamphlets, calendars, and periodicals. (Government Code section 82028)

Gifts of travel and related lodging and subsistence shall be subject to the current gift limitation except when: (Government Code section 89506)

1. The travel is in connection with a speech given by a board member or designated employee, provided the lodging and subsistence expenses are limited to the day immediately preceding, the day of, and the day immediately following the speech, and the travel is within the United States.
<!-- Page 35 -->
2. The travel is provided by a person or agency specified in Government Code section 89506, including a government, governmental agency or authority, bona fide public or private educational institution, as defined in Revenue and Taxation Code section 203, or nonprofit organization exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Gifts of travel exempted from the gift limitation, as described in items #1 and 2, above, shall nevertheless be reportable on the recipient's Statement of Economic Interest/Form 700 as required by law.

A gift of travel does not include travel provided by the district for board members and designated employees. (Government Code section 89506)

Honoraria  
Board members and designated employees shall not accept any honorarium, which is defined as any payment made in consideration for any speech given, article published, or attendance at any public or private gathering, in accordance with law. (Government Code sections 89501, 89502) The term honorarium does not include: (Government Code section 89501)

1. Earned income for personal services customarily provided in connection with a bona fide business, trade, or profession unless the sole or predominant activity of the business, trade, or profession is making speeches.

2. Any honorarium which is not used and, within 30 days after receipt, is either returned to the donor or delivered to the district for donation into the general fund without being claimed as a deduction from income for tax purposes.

The Board of Education recognizes that state open-meeting laws define a "meeting" as:

1. Any congregation of a majority of the members of the Board in the same time and place to hear, discuss or deliberate upon any item that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Board or district; and

2. Any use of direct communication, personal intermediaries or technological devices by a majority of Board members to develop a collective concurrence. (Government Code section 54952.2)

(cf. 9321 – Closed Sessions)  
(cf. 9322 – Agenda/Meeting Materials)  
(cf. 9323 – Meeting Conduct)  

Provided that the majority of the members do not discuss among themselves district business of a specific nature, attendance by a majority of the Board's members at any of the following events and individual contacts or conversations between a Board member and any other person are not subject to state open-meeting laws:

1. Individual attendance of a board majority at conferences that are open to the public involving a discussion of general interest to the public or other school districts;

![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Meetings+of+the+Governing+Board)

**Meetings of the Governing Board**  
Meetings of the Governing Board are conducted for the purpose of accomplishing district business. In accordance with applicable open meeting laws (Brown Act), the board shall hold its meetings in public and shall conduct closed sessions during such meetings only as authorized by law. To encourage community involvement in the schools, board meetings shall provide the opportunity for members of the public to directly address the board. All meetings shall be conducted in accordance with law and the board's bylaws, policies, and administrative regulations.

A board meeting exists whenever a majority of Board members gather at the same time and location, including teleconference location as permitted by Government Code 54953, to hear, discuss, deliberate, or take action upon any item within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board. (Government Code 54952.2)

In accordance with law and as specified in Board Bylaw 9012 - Board Member Electronic Communications, a majority of the board shall not, outside of an authorized meeting, use a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, including social media and other electronic communications, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board. (Government Code 54952.2)

However, the superintendent or designee may engage in separate conversations or communications with board members in order to answer questions or provide information regarding an item within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board, as long as that employee or district official does not communicate the comments or position of any board members to other board members. (Government Code 54952.2)

In order to help ensure the participation of individuals with disabilities at board meetings, the superintendent or designee shall provide appropriate disability-related accommodations or modifications upon request in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. A member of the public may contact the superintendent or designee to inquire about a request for accommodation. Notice of the time of a meeting is otherwise given or the agenda for the meeting is otherwise posted. (Government Code 54953, 54953.2, 54954.1, 54954.2)

**Regular Meetings**  
School Board meetings shall generally be held two times a month, although the Board may choose to have more or less meetings in any given month as they deem appropriate. When necessary, the day preceding a regular scheduled meeting shall also be deemed regular meetings so that the Board may meet in closed session concerning student discipline matters.

The times and dates of school board meetings will be established by the Board at the annual organizational meeting.

Should a fire, flood, earthquake or other emergency render the regular meeting place unsafe, meetings may be temporarily held at a place designated by the president or designee, who must notify all news media requesting notice of regular and special meetings. (Education Code section 35140, Government Code section 54954)

At least 72 hours prior to a regular meeting, the agenda shall be posted at one or more locations freely accessible to members of the public. Agendas shall also be made available to all district employees and sites on the district's computer network. No action shall be taken on any item not appearing on the posted agenda, except as allowed by law. (Government Code section 54954.2)

The agenda of each regular meeting shall be mailed to any owner of property in the district who requests it. Requests must be filed with the Board and shall contain the address of the property.
<!-- Page 43 -->
![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

Requests are valid for one year from the date filed and must be renewed annually within 90 days after January 1 of each year. (Government Code section 54954.1)

Persons requesting notices shall pay an annual mailing fee to cover costs as determined by the Superintendent or designee. (Government Code section 54954.1)

Consistent with Government Code 54957.5 and Board Bylaw 9322 - Agenda/Meeting Materials, whenever agenda materials relating to an open session of a regular meeting are distributed to the Board less than 72 hours before the meeting, the Superintendent or designee shall make the materials available for public inspection at a public office or location designated for that purpose. The records shall be posted on the district website at the time the materials are distributed to all or a majority of the Board if distributed outside of business hours.

### Special Meetings

Special meetings of the Board may be called by the presiding officer or a majority of the Board members on any topic within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board unless otherwise prohibited by law or as specified in BB 9323.2 - Actions by the Board. (Government Code 54956)

Notice of special meetings shall be delivered by mail, personally, or via facsimile transmission at least 24 hours before the meeting to all Board members, the Superintendent or designee, and to the local media who have requested such notice in writing. This notice shall also be posted at least 24 hours before the meeting in a location freely accessible to the public. This notice shall specify the time and place of the meeting and the business to be transacted; no other business shall be considered at these meetings. (Education Code section 35144, Government Code section 54956)

Any Board member may waive the 24-hour written notice requirement prior to the time of the meeting by filing a written waiver of notice with the clerk or secretary of the Board or by being present at the meeting at the time it convenes. (Education Code 35144; Government Code 54956)

Every notice of a special meeting shall provide an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the Board concerning any item that has been described in the meeting notice, before or after the item's consideration. (Government Code section 54954.3)

Public notice must be given at least 72 hours before any retreats, study sessions or training sessions held by the Board. All such meetings shall be held within district boundaries and action items shall not be included.

### Emergency Special Meeting

The Board may hold a special meeting without complying with the 24-hour notice requirement in the case of an emergency situation. An emergency situation means:

1. A work stoppage or other activity which severely impairs public health, safety, or both, as determined by a majority of the members of the Board.

2. A crippling disaster which severely impairs public health, safety, or both, as determined by a majority of the members of the Board.

In the case of an emergency situation for which prompt action is necessary due to the disruption or threatened disruption of public facilities, the board may hold an emergency meeting without complying with the 24-hour notice and/or 24-hour posting requirement for special meetings pursuant to
<!-- Page 44 -->
![Government Code 54956](https://example.com/image.png)

Government Code 54956. (Government Code 54956.5)

The board may meet in closed session during emergency meetings so long as two-thirds of the members present at the meeting agree or, if less than two-thirds of the members are present, by unanimous vote of the members present. (Government Code 54956.5)

The board shall comply with all other requirements for special meetings during an emergency meeting. (Government Code 54956.5)

Except in the case of a dire emergency, the board president or designee shall give notice of the emergency special meeting by telephone at least one hour before the meeting to the local media that have requested notice of special meetings. If telephone services are not functioning, the notice requirement of one hour is waived, as soon after the meeting as possible, the board shall notify those media representatives of the meeting and shall describe the purpose of the meeting and any action taken by the board. In the case of a dire emergency, the board president or designee shall give such notice at or near the time notification is given to the other members of the board. (Government Code 54956.5)

### AGENDA ITEM: G.9  
### MEETING DATE: 09/24/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Amendment No. 1 to Reimbursement Agreement for the El Camino Avenue at Kent Drive Traffic Signal Project with the County of Sacramento Department of Transportation  

**DEPARTMENT:** Operations  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve amendment No. 1 to the reimbursement agreement between the San Juan Unified School District and the County of Sacramento Department of Transportation in order to cover the additional costs for the traffic signal project at El Camino Avenue and Kent Drive to aid in traffic mitigation at the new Katherine Johnson Middle School site (formerly Creekside).  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The El Camino Avenue at Kent Drive traffic signal project includes construction of a traffic signal and associated appurtenances, including but not limited to construction of adjacent sidewalk ramps at El Camino Avenue and Kent Drive. The project will provide a mutual benefit to the county and district by improving the safety of routes to schools by installing a traffic signal for students crossing El Camino Avenue at Kent Drive.  

On November 14, 2023, the board approved the original reimbursement agreement between the district and the County of Sacramento Department of Transportation for the traffic signal project at El Camino Avenue and Kent Drive. After putting the project out to bid, the County of Sacramento Department of Transportation notified the district that there would be additional costs, as outlined in amendment No. 1 to the agreement.

**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  

**AGENDA ITEM:** I.1  
**MEETING DATE:** 09/24/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Attendance Improvement Initiative Update (Oaxaca) - 7:25 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Report: The superintendent is recommending that the board receive an update regarding the district Attendance Improvement Initiative.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The purpose of this report is to provide an update to the district’s Attendance Improvement Initiative for the 2024-25 school year. Attendance data, post-pandemic, clearly shows students are missing more days of school than pre-pandemic levels (locally and statewide). Attendance patterns created during the pandemic, exacerbated by external factors such as weather emergencies, natural disasters and social media threats, have had an impact on student attendance.  

The district's Attendance Improvement Initiative is based on multi-tiered system of supports (MTSS) framework. A major focus of the initiative is grounded in promoting tier 1 universal actions throughout the district, with schools creating welcoming, culturally responsive environments and building back overall student daily attendance and connections to school. Strategic tier II and intensive tier III strategies are effectively employed for chronically absent groups and individual students who are most in need of support.

## Background
In 2020-21, at least 14.7 million students nationwide were chronically absent. Chronic absence doubled from pre-Covid-19 levels (16% to over 30%). At the same time, San Juan USD chronic absenteeism was over 35%.  
*Source: Attendance Works, 2021 and CDC DataQuest*

As a result, the district launched an Attendance Improvement Initiative to improve post-Covid-19 attendance trends.

| **Tier 3** | Intensive case management with coordination of public agency and legal response as needed | 20% or more of school (severe chronic absence) |
| **Tier 2** | - Provide personalized early outreach  <br> - Meet to develop tailored action plan  <br> - Connect to a caring mentor | 10-19% of school (moderate chronic absence) |
| **Tier 1** | - Recognize good and improved attendance  <br> - Educate and engage students and families  <br> - Monitor attendance data and set goals  <br> - Establish positive and engaging school climate  <br> - Identify and address common barriers to getting to school | 5-9% of school (at risk) <br> Less than 5% of school (satisfactory) |

![Districtwide Attendance Improvement: Next Steps](https://via.placeholder.com/768x1008.png?text=Districtwide+Attendance+Improvement:+Next+Steps)

➔ Reinforce Tier 1 school climate and culture - creating warm, welcoming school environments and a sense of belonging for all students

➔ Monitor expansion of Attendance Academy across district (facilitator/student participation and attendance patterns)

➔ Commit to focusing on gradual attendance improvement: systemic attendance/behavior change is not immediate

➔ Monitor districtwide attendance rates for students overloaded from school of residence (reported transportation related absences)

**Why a land acknowledgement?**  
A land acknowledgement is a powerful way of showing respect, honoring the truth and taking a step toward correcting the practices that erase indigenous people’s history and culture.  

A land acknowledgement is a public recognition and invitation to uplift the lives and stories of the Indigenous Peoples who have been displaced from their homeland.

# Textbook and Instructional Materials Sufficiency

Sufficiency of textbooks and instructional materials at all school sites is maintained through Business Support Services. All school sites utilize the Follett system to manage and track their textbook assets. This system has the ability to check out textbooks, facilitate the Williams reporting process, and view textbook inventory (site and district-wide). All textbook requests are placed through the Follett system and fulfilled through the central process at the district textbook warehouse. If the textbook is not available in the textbook warehouse, unused copies are located at another school site through the Follett system by comparing class enrollment to the site inventory of the associated textbook. Minimal quantities of textbooks are kept in stock in the warehouse.

Charter schools are not required to participate in the Williams requirements.

## BOARD OF EDUCATION  

### AGENDA ITEM: I.4  
### MEETING DATE: 09/24/2024  

**SUBJECT:** New Board Policy 1160 Political Processes (Thigpen) - 8:05 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Labor Relations and Government Affairs  
**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt new Board Policy 1160 Political Processes.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
On Sept. 10, 2024, the Board of Education reviewed and discussed a draft of a proposed new board policy that communicates the intent and purpose for advocacy and requires the board to regularly adopt legislative priorities to guide advocacy work. This step was the continuation of a broader dialogue that began in August, when board members discussed the district’s government relations goals and ways the district can expand its voice to strengthen public policy that impacts student success.  

This updated draft Board Policy 1160: Political Processes incorporates revisions board members requested on Sept. 10. It is modeled after similar versions of a policy that has been adopted by large school districts locally and across the state, with provisions specific to San Juan Unified’s local context and in alignment with California School Boards Association (CSBA) recommendations and Government Code 53060.5.

## Policy 1160: Political Processes
**Original Adopted Date:** 

The Governing Board has a responsibility to actively advocate fiscal and public policy that supports the district's schools and students. The Board shall be proactive in defining the district's legislative priorities based on the district's strategic plan and the needs of the district and community. The Board's advocacy efforts shall be conducted in accordance with legal requirements.

### Legislation

The Board's responsibility as an advocate for the district is to establish legislative priorities based on the district’s strategic plan. The Superintendent or designee shall work to establish and maintain ongoing relationships with elected officials, community leaders, and the media in order to communicate district positions and concerns.

Before each two-year legislative session commences, the Board and Superintendent shall develop a set of legislative priorities that will define focus areas for district advocacy efforts. Based on these priorities, the Superintendent or designee may implement advocacy strategies including but not limited to: communicating positions on specific legislation, regulations, or budget proposals, development of key messages and talking points, public testimony, and outreach to the media. In order to strengthen legislative advocacy efforts, the Superintendent or designee may work with organizations and coalitions and may join associations whose representatives lobby on behalf of their members in accordance with Government Code 53060.5.

The district shall inform the Board and public about its advocacy activities no less than twice annually. If the Superintendent or designee anticipates the district will be taking a formal position on pending legislation, the Board shall be notified in writing in a timely manner.

The district may provide to the community fair and impartial information about legislative issues affecting schools and students. However, informational materials about legislation shall not urge the public to lobby the legislature, Governor, or state agencies on behalf of the district.

As necessary, the Superintendent or designee may bring to the board for discussion and action draft legislative or regulatory proposals (including but not limited to district-sponsored legislation) which serve the district's interests.

### Board Member Request for Action or Information on Legislation

Requests by individual Board members shall follow the procedures established in the board-adopted Governance Handbook.
