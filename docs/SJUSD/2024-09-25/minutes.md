After public comment, board members engaged in discussion. Ms. Villescaz expressed her support for the land acknowledgement, encouraging genuine implementation rather than simply reciting words. Ms. Kravchuk shared that she researched land acknowledgements and recognizes their importance to the community. Ms. Kravchuk emphasized the need to consider the process, asking about the parameters for such acknowledgements and how decisions are made if others groups make a similar request, and she inquired about how the land acknowledgement could become more of a learning experience. Mr. Avey inquired about the district’s current History-Social Science curriculum specifically related to the teaching of Native American history, which Director of Professional Learning and Innovation, Nicole Kuklard, addressed. Mr. Avey made comments regarding educating students about America’s past. While Mr. Avey expressed support for the land acknowledgement statement, he questioned how it should be implemented, whether it should be included only at the organizational meeting or at every board meeting. Ms. Creason expressed support for moving forward with the land acknowledgement, stating that implementing this is a simple, yet meaningful way to restore justice, and she expressed gratitude to the community for their efforts. Mr. Hernandez expressed his support for the land acknowledgement and noted his efforts to recognize the AIEP PAC. Mr. Hernandez wondered if the land acknowledgment might get diluted if it is too frequent, and he suggested reading it at the first and last meetings of the year, as well as at high school graduations, and printing it in the agenda. Mr. Perez expressed support for the land acknowledgement statement, but shared that he is uncertain whether it should be implemented at every board meeting or just at the first and last meetings, and high school graduations. Superintendent Bassanelli explained how the item was originally agendized using the process outlined in the Governance Handbook. Ms. Kravchuk reiterated her concerns regarding how future requests from other groups would be handled. Mr. Avey said he believes it is at the discretion of the board to consider each request. Ms. Villescaz concurred that the same process would be repeated for future requests, unless new rules are adopted as part of the Governance Handbook. Ms. Villescaz expressed support for the implementation compromise regarding the cadence of meetings. Ms. Creason requested community feedback on the frequency change. Ms. Villescaz asked a question about the number of tribes listed in the resolution, which Indian Education School Community Worker, Samantha Manriquez, addressed. Ms. Costa thanked the community for its input, expressed support for the land acknowledgement statement and confirmed with Superintendent Bassanelli that enough information had been provided to proceed with fine-tuning the recommendation for further discussion and possible action on October 22.
