### MEETING DATE: 05/28/2024

**SUBJECT:** CEQA Notice of Exemption for the Arden Middle School Shade Structure Project

Arden Middle School Shade Structure  
CEQA Categorical Exemption  
Terracon Project No: NB247060  

---

**Project Information:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Arden Middle School’s campus at 1640 Watt Avenue (APN: 288-0010-001), in Sacramento, California. The project area spans approximately 1,790 square feet of primarily paved areas within the school’s boundaries (Exhibit 1). The project scope includes the installation of a new custom shade structure to facilitate outdoor learning.

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 15, Section 15300 et seq.

---

**Legal Setting:**  
Categorical Exemptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300)  
Projects that are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact may be Categorically Exempt from CEQA review. As described in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300, Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires these guidelines to include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. In response to that mandate, the Secretary for Resources has found that the following classes of projects listed in this article do not have a significant effect on the environment, and they are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.

Like many school-maintenance projects (that do not involve significant increase in classrooms or student capacity), the proposed project is not expected to result in significant environmental impacts under CEQA. Table 1 provides an abbreviated CEQA checklist, explaining why the implementation of the proposed project would not result in any significant environmental impacts.

**Arden Middle School Shade Structure | Sacramento, CA**  
**May 7, 2024 | Terracon Project No. NB247060**

**Table 1. Abbreviated CEQA Environmental Checklist**

| Impact Category                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aesthetics                          | The project would not result in impacts related to scenic vistas, state-listed scenic highways. Any new lighting associated with the proposed project would be consistent with previous conditions and would not result in an impact on Aesthetics. |
| Agriculture and Forestry Resources   | The proposed project would not involve agricultural lands or Prime Farmland.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Air Quality                         | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of pollutants or odors to sensitive receptors. Although Sacramento County is in nonattainment status for PM-2.5 (2006) and 8-Hour Ozone (2015) criteria pollutants, the proposed project would not result in a significant net increase of such pollutants, nor would the project conflict with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)’s ability to comply with any applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP). |
| Biological Resources                | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), Natural Community Conservation Planning (NCCP), or other sensitive biological resources. |
| Cultural Resources                  | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not expected to contain archeological artifacts as the project involves ground disturbance in areas previously disturbed. If archeological or cultural resources are discovered onsite, work would cease immediately until consultation and approval to continue work was provided by a qualified archeologist. |
| Energy                              | The proposed project would not result in an impact related to the wasteful or inefficient use of energy since the project will not require the use of equipment with high energy requirements during its operation.                |
| Geology and Soils                  | The proposed project would not result in geological impacts. The project construction would mostly take place on existing pavement and would not result in new construction in unsafe soils.                                        |
| Greenhouse Gas Emissions            | Although greenhouse gases would be emitted during project construction, it would not result in a significant impact on the environment, nor would it conflict with a plan, policy, or regulation aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. |

**Arden Middle School Shade Structure | Sacramento, CA**  
**May 7, 2024 | Terracon Project No. NB247060**

### Hazards and Hazardous Materials
The proposed project would not involve the use or release of potentially hazardous substances. Abatement of Hazardous Materials Plan (AHMP) will be created prior to project construction to handle potential unexpected encounters with hazardous materials.

### Hydrology and Water Quality
Local water quality impacts would be avoided by the usage of routing stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) during construction and material staging activities.

### Land Use and Planning
The proposed project would not divide an established community, nor would it result in a conflict with a land use plan or zoning ordinance as the project does not modify existing land use.

### Mineral Resources
The proposed project would not require the extraction of Mineral Resources.

### Noise
The proposed project would not result in the exposure of excessive noise levels. Construction would not take place during the school year. Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts.

### Population and Housing
The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth.

### Public Services
The proposed project would not negatively affect public services, but instead would improve the school’s ability to provide and facilitate outdoor learning opportunities.

### Recreation
The proposed project would not lead to the deterioration of existing recreational facilities, but instead would enhance existing recreational opportunities. The project would not involve the construction of new facilities that would result in an adverse physical environmental consequence.

### Transportation
The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation since the bulk of construction is occurring away from a main thoroughfare and is occurring away from the main parking lot and student drop-off zones.

### Tribal Cultural Resources
The proposed project is not anticipated to have an impact on a listed or eligible resource as there are no known ties to the site; however, if resources are discovered during any ground disturbing activities, work will cease immediately and both federally and state recognized tribes will be contacted.

May 7, 2024 | Terracon Project No. NB247060  

**Wildfire**  
The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards since the project will not increase fire loading.

**Mandatory Findings of Significance**  
The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species or impact known resources. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact.

**Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)**  
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located – a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.

(e) **Hazardous Waste Sites.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) **Historical Resources.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

**Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314)**  
Class 14 projects are described in § 15314 as "minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less." The project would take place entirely within Arden Middle School’s existing property and would not involve the addition of any new classrooms, nor would it affect the school’s student capacity. The proposed project fits the description provided in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314.

**Summary:**  
The proposed project would not result in any significant impacts to the environment (please see Table 1). The activities that make up the proposed project (installation of a shade structure) meet both

**CEQA Categorical Exemption Memorandum**  
Arden Middle School Shade Structure | Sacramento, CA  
May 7, 2024 | Terracon Project No. NB247206

The description of a Class 14-exempt project as well as the criteria listed in the Exceptions to CEQA Categorical Exemptions. The long-term effects of the project are likely to improve the school’s ability to protect students from environmental factors while enjoying outdoor learning and recreational activities. The project site is not in the vicinity of a Scenic Highway, and the project would not be expected to impact historical resources. No historic properties are known to exist in the project area; if artifacts were to be found during construction, work would stop immediately, and a qualified archeologist would be consulted with before work were to resume. The project site does not appear to contain sensitive biological resources; however, if any were discovered, general avoidance and minimization measures (such as a nesting bird survey) would be implemented to avoid potential impacts to biological resources.

The project area is not located on a hazard waste site or other environmental feature of critical concern. The proposed project would not result in a significant impact, nor would it result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant cumulative impact. Considering the data summarized in this memorandum, it is Terracon’s opinion that the Arden Middle School Custom Shade project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA documentation.

Sincerely,

Terracon Consultants, Inc.

# Building Thinking Classrooms Executive Summary

In response to the evolving educational landscape, our district has embarked on a transformative journey inspired by the work of Peter Liljedahl's Building Thinking Classrooms (BTC) approach. This innovative pedagogical framework is designed to cultivate deep mathematical thinking, foster a growth mindset, and promote a collaborative classroom culture conducive to meaningful learning experiences.

The BTC approach centers around creating classrooms where students’ thinking is valued, visible, and actively promoted. Teachers serve as facilitators of learning, orchestrating rich mathematical tasks and classroom routines that engage students in sense-making and problem-solving. Key components of the BTC approach include:

- **Vertical Non-Permanent Surfaces (VNPS):** Embracing the use of vertical spaces, such as whiteboards or windows, to promote collaboration and discourse. Students work collaboratively on vertical surfaces, allowing for the sharing of ideas, peer feedback, and collective sense-making. This fosters a culture of active engagement and encourages students to explore multiple problem-solving strategies.

- **Inquiry:** Encouraging students to develop their mathematical intuition by asking open-ended questions and prompting them to notice patterns, make connections, and wonder about mathematical concepts. Through this process, students become active participants in their own learning, developing curiosity and a deeper understanding of mathematical principles.

- **Thinking Classrooms Routines:** Implementing structured routines and protocols to elicit student thinking, promote metacognition, and deepen conceptual understanding. These routines provide opportunities for formative assessment and feedback, allowing teachers to tailor instruction to meet students' individual needs effectively.

The impact of the BTC approach is profound, with teachers reporting increased student engagement, deeper mathematical understanding, and a more positive and inclusive classroom culture. Students demonstrate greater perseverance, resilience, and confidence in their mathematical abilities, leading to improved academic outcomes and a passion for lifelong learning.

Looking ahead, our district is committed to sustaining and expanding upon the principles of Building Thinking Classrooms to ensure all students have equitable access to high-quality mathematical instruction. By fostering a culture of curiosity, collaboration, and critical thinking, we empower students to become confident problem solvers and active contributors to a dynamic, interconnected world.

# Math Recovery Executive Summary

San Juan Unified practitioners have been deeply engaged in professional development focused on early numeracy development and assessment-guided instruction, drawing upon the research and methodologies advocated by the US Math Recovery Council (USMRC) and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM).

The initiative aims to equip educators with the knowledge and tools necessary to effectively support students in their mathematical journey, particularly in the critical early years of education. Through targeted training sessions and collaborative workshops, teachers have been immersed in evidence-based practices and instructional strategies endorsed by the USMRC. These strategies not only foster a deeper understanding of numerical concepts but also empower educators to tailor their instruction to meet the diverse needs of every learner.

Key components of the professional development initiative include:

### Understanding Early Numeracy Development:
Teachers have delved into the developmental progression of numeracy skills, gaining insights into how children construct mathematical understanding from foundational concepts to more complex mathematical operations. By understanding the developmental trajectory, educators can better identify students' strengths and areas for growth, thereby informing instructional decisions.

### Assessment-Guided Instruction:
A central tenet of the USMRC approach is the use of ongoing, formative assessment to inform instructional planning. Teachers have been trained in administering and utilizing interview-based assessments to capture students' mathematical thinking, diagnose misconceptions, and design targeted interventions. This iterative process ensures that instruction is responsive and aligned with students' evolving needs.

### Equity and Excellence in Mathematics:
Recognizing that students enter classrooms with diverse mathematical backgrounds and learning profiles, teachers have explored strategies for differentiation to ensure all learners receive appropriate support and challenge. By applying an understanding of how students develop mathematical proficiency, educators can more meaningfully scaffold learning experiences to meet students at their individual readiness levels, promoting equitable access to mathematical learning.

The impact of this initiative is already tangible within our classrooms. Surveys indicate teachers have greater confidence in their ability to diagnose and address students' mathematical needs. Additionally, early indicators suggest that students are making meaningful gains in their numeracy skills, laying a solid foundation for future mathematical success.

Looking ahead, sustaining and expanding upon this work will be critical to furthering our district's commitment to mathematical excellence and equity. Continued investment in professional development, established support structures, and a culture of collaboration will ensure that all students have the opportunity to develop the strong numeracy skills necessary for success in school and beyond.

SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
BOARD OF EDUCATION  

AGENDA ITEM: I-3  
MEETING DATE: 05/28/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Proposed Strategic Plan  
**DEPARTMENT:** Administration  

CHECK ONE:  
For Discussion: ☐  
For Action: ☑  
Report: ☐  
Workshop: ☐  
Recognition: ☐  
Emergency Action: ☐  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt the proposed strategic plan developed through extensive input and feedback from students, families, staff and community members.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
As shared with the board in February, last fall the district engaged in a strategic planning process by collecting input and feedback from a variety of educational partners that represent interests in our educational system including students, families, community members staff and others.  

After reviewing the voice collected, a draft framework was developed and then circulated for feedback. Representative teams then met to consider the feedback and make revisions yielding a final proposed strategic plan.  

The proposed strategic plan presents four strategic directions: 1) Advance Student Success; 2) Prioritize Equitable Practices; 3) Enhance Employee Support Systems; and 4) Invest in Efforts to Assist Students and Families to Empower Themselves. Each strategic direction identifies a purpose statement to help bring clarity to its intended meaning and priority outcomes that identify what we will see in San Juan Unified should our efforts in these areas be successful.  

Additionally, the district’s current mission and beliefs were reviewed and updated with feedback from representative teams to reflect where San Juan Unified stands today and to incorporate a vision of what we hope to achieve in the future. These proposed changes again reflect the varied and vital voice collected through the intensive engagement process.  

The proposed strategic plan identifies the framework from which district efforts will be guided for the next five years. Should the board adopt the strategic plan, the next step will be for staff to operationalize the plan by developing specific action plans aligned to the strategic directions and their identified priority outcomes for the next school year. This work will begin in the summer and lead into the fall with feedback from our students, staff, families and community.

### AGENDA ITEM: I-6  
### MEETING DATE: 05/28/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Intent to Convey Easement at Del Paso Manor Elementary School to the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District  
**DEPARTMENT:** Facilities  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending the board adopt Resolution No. 4139 declaring the intent to convey a permanent easement at Del Paso Manor Elementary School to the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District, and to call a public hearing to be held on June 11, 2024.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District maintains seven air monitoring stations across the county. Since 1979, one of these air monitoring stations has been stationed at 2701 Avalon Drive, Sacramento, on the campus of Del Paso Manor Elementary School located at 2700 Maryal Drive, Sacramento.  

The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District has an agreement with the district to install an air monitoring station on the school’s property. The amount of equipment at Del Paso Manor has steadily increased due to stricter Environmental Protection Agency regulations. The existing station configuration can no longer accommodate more equipment without improvements to the building structure. Therefore, the air monitoring station requires renovation and site expansion to accommodate additional equipment.  

The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District has already been approved by the district to expand the footprint of the air monitoring station and received approval from the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) to install underground electrical conduit. SMUD needs the district to sign a conveyance of electrical distribution facilities acknowledgement before the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District can start work.

**Easement Request**

To: San Juan Unified School District  
From: Levi Ford, Air Monitoring Supervisor,  
Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District  
Date: April 30, 2024  

**Background:** Since the 1960s, the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (Licensee) has been responsible for monitoring air pollution in Sacramento County. The Licensee maintains seven air monitoring stations across the county. One of these air monitoring stations has been stationed at the Del Paso Manor Elementary School property at 2701 Avalon Drive since 1979.

The licensee had an agreement with San Juan Unified District (District), a California public school, to allow an air monitoring station to be installed on the school’s property. The amount of equipment in Del Paso Manor has steadily increased due to an increase in Environmental Protection Agency regulations and the existing station configuration can no longer accommodate more equipment with improvements to the building structure. The air monitoring station requires renovation and site expansion to accommodate additional equipment.

The District and the Licensee executed air monitoring site agreement number E2019005 to accommodate the expansion for additional space. The effective date of the agreement was July 1, 2019. The term of the agreement was for 5 years and will automatically renew for two additional 5-year terms.

Section 13 of this agreement, “Improvements”, states “With the prior written approval of the District, Licensee may, at its own sole cost and expense, construct or cause to be constructed on the premises those alterations, additions, improvements which the Licensee deems necessary to its permitted uses of the premises, subject to the local site, zoning, and design review and other required approvals….”

Licensee has already been approved by the District to expand the footprint of the air monitoring station and received approval from SMUD to install underground electrical conduit. SMUD needs the property owner to sign a conveyance of electrical distribution facilities acknowledgement before the Licensee can start work.

**Request:** Licensee requests the District allow the Licensee to install an underground electrical conduit as described in Exhibit A, Exhibit B and supporting documents (CR5392 and Survey 94) by signing the conveyance of electronic distribution facilities notification #32304408.

District shall have the right, if it so desires, to accompany Licensee while Licensee is on the Property. Licensee shall promptly repair any broken facilities and any damage done by Licensee to District’s Property, including, without limitation, damage to any landscaping or pavement, in connection with Licensee’s exercise of its rights granted hereunder.

Licensee shall (i) comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations, and any and all reasonable and uniform rules created by District for utility providers from time to time to the extent consistent with good utility practice and standard of care so long as said rules created by District are provided to Licensee in writing and accepted by Licensee in writing, and (ii) exercise reasonable care in the use and enjoyment of the Easement Area and perform all work in the Easement Area in a safe and good workmanlike manner.
