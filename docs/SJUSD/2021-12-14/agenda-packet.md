# RESOLUTION NO. 3092

## RESOLUTION BEFORE THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION APPROVING THE AWARD OF THE LEASE-LEASEBACK CONTRACT TO OTTO CONSTRUCTION FOR THE STARR KING TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN/KINDERGARTEN PROJECT AND SETTING FORTH THE WRITTEN BASIS FOR THIS DECISION TO AWARD

WHEREAS, sections 17406 of the Education Code authorize school districts, including the San Juan Unified School District (“District”), to use the lease-leaseback procurement process;

WHEREAS, by Resolution No. 2831, the San Juan Unified School District Board of Education adopted the mandatory procedures and guidelines for use in lease-leaseback projects;

WHEREAS, consistent with those mandatory procedures and guidelines, the District issued Request for Proposals #22-202 (“RFP”), which (1) included a requirement for proposers to be prequalified under Section 20111.6 of the Public Contract Code, (2) included an estimate of the Project, a description of preconstruction services to be provided, and a description of the facilities to be constructed; (3) included the key elements of the instrument to be awarded; (4) included a description of the criteria to be considered in evaluating the Proposals; and (5) included the scoring to be applied to the proposals; and

WHEREAS, seven (7) potential lease-leaseback proposers submitted Proposals in response to the RFP, which, the District has carefully examined

NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to Education Code section 17406 the San Juan Unified School District Board of Education does hereby determine to award the Site Lease and Facilities Lease for the Project to Otto Construction for the following reasons:

1. The District determined to select its lease-leaseback provider for the Project based on best value in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated in the RFP.

2. Otto Construction submitted a Proposal responsive to the RFP, which has been determined to present the best value to the District. The Proposal received a score of 231.8 out of a possible 330. This was the highest score received, with the other two proposers receiving scores of 228.2 Landmark Construction and “withdrawn” Clark & Sullivan Construction. Clark & Sullivan withdrew their proposal because they submitted a performance period that was incorrect and not consistent with their ability to perform within the specified period.

3. Otto Construction demonstrated that it will satisfy the skilled and trained workforce availability, as defined in Public Contract Code section 2601

4. The initial amount of the Facilities Lease shall be $236,000.00 for preconstruction services only. No construction services are authorized at this time without DSA approval.

The foregoing findings and decision to award were made by the San Juan Unified School District Board of Education at a meeting of the Board on December 14, 2021, by the following vote:

**AGENDA ITEM:** J-1  
**MEETING DATE:** 12/14/2021  

**SUBJECT:** San Juan Choices Charter School On-Going Salary Schedule Adjustment and One-Time, Off-Schedule Payment  
**DEPARTMENT:** Admissions and Family Services  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the on-going salary schedule adjustment and a one-time, off-schedule payment for San Juan Choices Charter School (CCS).  

Base salaries shall be increased by a total of 3.55%, effective July 1, 2021. CCS shall provide a one-time, off-schedule payment, for all employees employed as of July 1, 2021, and still employed as of November 1, 2021, equal to 3.5% of their annual base salary. If a continuing employee from the 2020-2021 school year is not on a base salary schedule, CCS is requesting a 3.5% one-time, off-schedule payment based on wages and stipends from the fiscal year ending June 30, 2021.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
San Juan Choices Charter School (CCS) attempts to, when fiscally possible, match the raises and bonuses the district provides to its own employees. On June 22, 2021, the board approved a salary schedule increase of 3.5% for bargaining groups and Cabinet, Confidential and Unrepresented Unit members, as well as a one-time, off-schedule bonus of 3.5% for all continuing members of same groups employed as of July 1, 2021. Because of the timing of the district’s approval, CCS was unable to make their request before the end of the 2020-2021 fiscal year.  

CCS has a yearly operating surplus that has been generated by school funding and enrollment growth. For fiscal year 2020-2021, CCS ended the year with a surplus of $178,236, which increased the fund balance to $1,496,173. The proposed salary schedule increase would increase operating costs an additional $68,867; the one-time, off-schedule bonus of 3.5% represents 39.6% of the 2020-2021 surplus, and less than 5% of the CCS fund balance. CCS anticipates moderate growth over the next three years, maintaining a growing fund balance during that time.

### ACTION REQUESTED:
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve option B bell schedule for the 2022-2023 school year.

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:
In accordance with Senate Bill 328, which was approved on October 13, 2019, school districts are required to adjust their school days by July 1, 2022, to begin no earlier than 8:00 a.m. for middle schools and 8:30 a.m. for high schools. Because of the district’s mandated transportation services, adjustments to the start times of elementary schools will be necessary as well in order to comply with SB 328. Solutions that cause additional transportation routes to be created would cause stress on the system due to a national shortage of drivers and the cost and time involved in acquiring new busses.

On October 26, 2021, staff presented three potential bell schedule options for the 2022-2023 school year which included the cost for each option, as well as equipment and staffing challenges.

Option B is being recommended for approval. This option is forecast to cause only a minor impact to the transportation system compared with option C, and moves start times of schools less drastically than option A. Start times would be adjusted between 0 and 45 minutes.

Option A is based on a model that creates the most efficient transportation solution and would reduce the number of routes used for an overall cost savings. However, it also results in the greatest level of change in school start times with some sites moving by more than one hour. This level of change could be an especially hard adjustment for some families and staff members.

Option C would leave elementary start times where they are and move only the middle and high school times. The impact to the transportation system is the creation of more than 20 routes at a significant cost increase that would necessitate cost reductions in other areas.

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending the board hold a public hearing to receive community input regarding revised map options, and to provide input and guidance to the demographer on map options based on the 2020 census data.  

---

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
On July 27, 2021, the board selected preferred trustee districts. The map selected used 2010 census data because the 2020 data had yet to be published. The 2020 census data was validated by the California Department of Finance and finalized on September 27, 2021. Based on the 2020 census data, the current trustee areas are not in compliance based on total population distribution. Updated maps may need to be drawn with new boundaries based on the 2020 census data in order to maintain compliance with the law.

# OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTION

## FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

The San Juan Unified School District financial status is comprised of three major components: (1) Fund Balance (Ending and Beginning Balance); (2) Revenues; and (3) Expenditures. Estimates in the First Interim Report are based on actual activity through October 31, 2021. The district certifies this report as Positive. The Second Interim Report will be presented in March 2022.

## DISTRICT MISSION

Valuing diversity and excellence, the San Juan Unified School District’s mission is to educate and inspire each student to succeed and responsibly contribute to a radically evolving world by providing innovative, rigorous, student-focused instruction and programs in a safe, caring, and collaborative learning community.

## SHARED BELIEFS

We Believe That:
- Every person is unique and has equal worth.
- Everyone can and will learn.
- People learn in different ways and at varied paces.
- Education is the shared responsibility of students, families, teachers, staff and community.
- Quality education expands opportunities throughout a person’s life.
- Challenging people to meet high expectations leads to exceptional learning and remarkable results.
- Nurturing relationships and healthy environments are necessary for individuals to thrive.
- Diversity is a valuable asset that strengthens and enriches our community.
- Personal development and community well-being depend on individual responsibility.
- Everyone benefits when people willingly contribute to the well-being of others.
- Honesty and integrity are essential to build trusting relationships.
- Access to quality public education is essential to our democracy.

![Introduction 2021-22 First Interim San Juan Unified School District](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Introduction+2021-22+First+Interim+San+Juan+Unified+School+District)

**CORE COMMITMENTS**

- Prioritize resources to close achievement gaps, improve teaching and learning, recruit and retain high quality employees and help all students reach their potential.
- Provide sound fiscal stewardship of community resources.
- Build trust by sharing useful, transparent fiscal information.
- Adopt a budget that consistently balances on-going revenues and expenditures to avoid a structural deficit.
- Preserve an ending fund balance that ensures integrity and stability of the district.

**CORE MESSAGES**

- The economy has undergone a rapid, but uneven recovery. State revenues are trending ahead of the projections used in the 2021-22 enacted budget.
- The recent Legislative Analyst’s Office (LAO) Fiscal Outlook Report focused on addressing three key issues: historic state surplus, the constraints of the State Appropriations Limit on budget choices, and the state’s capacity to commit to new and ongoing spending or tax reductions.
- We encourage state leaders to continue to prioritize the high-quality public education promised to students; continue to provide funding for the Expanded Learning Opportunities program, provide additional base funding to help districts implement robust TK programs over the next five years and use additional funds to support core programs without adding categorical programs.
- The district will continue to exercise caution and flexibility in long-term fiscal planning. The budget will support on-going expenditures with on-going revenues and meet the requirements of a positive certification.

**SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION (SCOE)**

The Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) reviews all district budgets and interim budget reports. SCOE has an oversight obligation to monitor the district’s long-term fiscal health as prescribed in AB 1200. SCOE has provided the following guidance:

- The level of LCFF funding is subject to economic conditions as well as political decisions by the governor and legislature.
- Re-evaluate spending priorities to address student achievement and begin new initiatives only if long-term solvency can be maintained (avoid cycles of additions and reductions).
- Exercise caution and maintain flexibility in collective bargaining process. Neighboring districts have widely divergent levels of funding. Consider increases to pension rates, rising health care costs, and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
- Maintain reserves much greater than the minimum requirement.
- Support on-going expenditures with on-going revenues.

# 2021-23 MULTI-YEAR PROJECTIONS

The district primarily uses estimates from the Department of Finance (DOF) to project LCFF revenue growth in 2021-22 and 2022-23. The district Planning Department provides enrollment estimates, which are used to calculate Average Daily Attendance (ADA), the basis of state funding. Operating costs for future years are projected using historical patterns, statistical probabilities, and projected cost of living adjustments (COLA’s). Significant expenditure assumptions include salaries, seniority and retirement of employees, healthcare and other benefit costs, public pension plans (STRS and PERS), utilities, property, and liability insurance, etc.

**8B. Calculating the District's Change in Total Operating Revenues and Expenditures**

DATA ENTRY: All data are extracted or calculated.

| Object Range / Fiscal Year | Budget Adoption | First Interim | Projected Year Totals | Percent Change | Status |
|----------------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------------|----------------|--------|
| Total Federal, Other State, and Other Local Revenue (Section 6A) | Current Year (2021-22) | 114,424,670.00 | 209,406,916.00 | 80.4% | Not Met |
| 1st Subsequent Year (2022-23) | 107,989,882.00 | 149,454,455.00 | 38.9% | Not Met |
| 2nd Subsequent Year (2023-24) | 107,982,891.00 | 114,614,099.00 | 6.1% | Not Met |

| Total Books and Supplies, and Services and Other Operating Expenditures (Section 6A) | Current Year (2021-22) | 105,349,740.00 | 105,306,946.00 | 0.0% | Met |
| 1st Subsequent Year (2022-23) | 53,452,220.00 | 70,987,241.00 | 31.9% | Not Met |
| 2nd Subsequent Year (2023-24) | 51,607,321.00 | 55,764,368.00 | 8.1% | Not Met |

**6C. Comparison of District Total Operating Revenues and Expenditures to the Standard Percentage Range**

DATA ENTRY: Explanations are linked from Section 6A if the status in Section 6B is Not Met, no entry is allowed below.

1a. **STANDARD NOT MET** - One or more projected operating revenue changes since budget adoption by more than the standard in one or more of the current year or two subsequent fiscal years. Reasons for the projected change, descriptions of the methods and assumptions used in the projections, and what changes, if any, will be made to bring the projected operating revenues within the standard must be entered in Section 6A above and will also display in the explanation box below.

**Explanation:**
- Federal Revenue (linked from 6A)
- Other State Revenue (linked from 6A)

The current year increase is due to a net of one-time Covid funds RES 7422, 7425, Special Education Learning Recovery Support RES 6537, Special Education appropriation from the state, and ASBS RES 6010 and expected carryover. In the 2 additional years the one-time money is expected to have been spent and carryover for other revenue sources in the budget.

1b. **STANDARD NOT MET** - One or more total operating expenditures have changed since budget adoption by more than the standard in one or more of the current year or two subsequent fiscal years. Reasons for the projected change, descriptions of the methods and assumptions used in the projections, and what changes, if any, will be made to bring the projected operating revenues within the standard must be entered in Section 6A above and will also display in the explanation box below.

**Explanation:**
- Books and Supplies (linked from 6A)
- Services and Other Exps (linked from 6A)

The difference is due to the change in one-time funds, budgeting for carryover that would not have been included at adopted budget and aligning budgets to current year spending plans.

![Status of Labor Agreements](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Status+of+Labor+Agreements)

**S8. Status of Labor Agreements**

Analyze the status of all employee labor agreements. Identify new labor agreements that have been ratified since budget adoption, as well as new commitments provided as part of previously ratified multiyear agreements; and include all contracts, including all administrator contracts (and including all compensation). For new agreements, indicate the date of the required board meeting. Compare the increase in new commitments to the projected increase in ongoing revenues and explain how these commitments will be funded in future fiscal years.

If salary and benefit negotiations are not finalized, upon settlement with certificated or classified staff:

The school district must determine the cost of the settlement, including salaries, benefits, and any other agreements that change costs, and provide the county office of education (COE) with an analysis of the cost of the settlement and its impact on the operating budget.

The county superintendent shall review the analysis relative to the criteria and standards and may provide written comments to the president of the district governing board and superintendent.

![San Juan Unified Special Education Maintenance of Effort](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=San+Juan+Unified+Special+Education+Maintenance+of+Effort)

**SELPA:** San Juan Unified (CN)

This form is used to check maintenance of effort (MOE) for an LEA, whether the LEA is a member of a SELPA or is a single-LEA SELPA.

Per the federal Subsequent Years Rule, in order to determine the required level of effort, the LEA must look back to the last fiscal year in which the LEA maintained effort using the same method by which it is currently establishing the compliance standard. To meet the requirement of the Subsequent Years Rule, the LMC-I worksheet has been revised to make changes to sections 3.A.1, 3.A.2, 3.B.1, and 3.B.2. The revised sections allow the LEA to compare the 2021-22 projected expenditures to the most recent fiscal year the LEA met MOE using that method, which is the comparison year.

There are four methods that the LEA can use to demonstrate the compliance standard. They are (1) combined state and local expenditures; (2) combined state and local expenditures on a per capita basis; (3) local expenditures only; and (4) local expenditures only on a per capita basis.

The LEA is only required to pass one of the tests to meet the MOE requirement. However, the LEA is required to show results for all four methods.

**SECTION 1 Exempt Reduction Under 34 CFR Section 300.204**

If your LEA determines that a reduction in expenditures occurred as a result of one or more of the following conditions, you may calculate a reduction to the required MOE standard. Reductions may apply to combined state and local MOE standard, local only MOE standard, or both.

1. Voluntary departure, by retirement or otherwise, or departure for just cause, of special education related services personnel.

2. A decrease in the enrollment of children with disabilities.

3. The termination of the obligation of the agency to provide a program of special education to a particular child with a disability that is an exceptionally costly program, as determined by the SEA, because the child:
   a. Has left the jurisdiction of the agency;
   b. Has reached the age at which the obligation of the agency to provide free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the child has terminated; or
   c. No longer needs the program of special education.

4. The termination of costly expenditures for long-term purchases, such as the acquisition of equipment or the construction of school facilities.

5. The assumption of cost by the high cost fund operated by the SEA under 34 CFR Sec. 300.704(c).

Provide the condition number, if any, to be used in the calculation below: 

| State and Local | Local Only |
|-----------------|------------|

**SECTION 2**  
**Reduction to MOE Requirement Under IDEA, Section 613 (a)(2)(C) (34 CFR Sec. 300.205)**  
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Only LEAs that have a "meets requirement" compliance determination and that are not significantly disproportionate for the current year are eligible to use this option to reduce their MOE requirement.  

Up to 50% of the increase in IDEA Part B Section 611 funding in current year compared with prior year may be used to reduce the required level of state and local expenditures. This option is available only if the LEA used or will use the freed up funds for activities authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. Also, the amount of Part B funds used for early intervening services (34 CFR 300.226(a)) will count toward the maximum amount by which the LEA may reduce its MOE requirement under this exception [P.L. 108-446].  

| State and Local | Local Only |
|-----------------|------------|
| Current year funding (IDEA Section 611 Local Assistance Grant Award - Resource 3310) |  |
| Less: Prior year's funding (IDEA Section 611 Local Assistance Grant Award - Resource 3310) |  |
| Increase in funding (if difference is positive) | 0.00 |
| Maximum available for MOE reduction (50% of increase in funding) | 0.00 (a) |

| Maximum available for early intervening services (EIS) (15% of current year funding - Resources 3310 and 3315) | 0.00 (b) |

Enter portion to set aside for EIS (cannot exceed line (b), Maximum available for EIS) | (c) |  |
| Available for MOE reduction. | (line (a) minus line (c), zero if negative) | 0.00 (d) |
| Enter portion used to reduce MOE requirement (cannot exceed line (d), Available for MOE reduction). |  |  |

| Available to set aside for EIS (line (b) minus line (e), zero if negative) | 0.00 (f) |

**Note:** If your LEA exercises the authority under 34 CFR 300.205(a) to reduce the MOE requirement, the LEA must list the activities (which are authorized under the ESEA) paid with the freed up funds:

|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| LCFF         | $380,513,416               | $383,706,739             |
| Federal Revenue | 0                        | 0                        |
| State Revenue | 9,762,408                 | 9,376,663                |
| Local Revenue | 2,938,794                 | 3,431,374                |
| **Total Revenue** | **$393,214,618**     | **$396,514,776**        |

- The increase in LCFF Revenues of $3,193,323 is due to a shift in ADA from a lower funded grade span amount to a higher funded grade span amount and a projected increase in our Unduplicated Pupil Percentage of .38%.

**General Fund – Restricted Revenues**  

| Restricted | 45 Day Budget Projections | 1st Interim Projections |
|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| LCFF       | $2,152,202                | $2,061,615              |
| Federal Revenue | $156,224,428         | $112,750,169            |
| State Revenue   | $66,959,165          | $75,790,027             |
| Local Revenue   | $3,145,949           | $5,092,683              |
| **Total Revenue** | **$228,481,744**  | **$195,694,494**        |

- The change in Federal Revenue of approximately $43.4M is a result of the net effect of stimulus funds that were budgeted in their entirety being removed from current year budget and added to FY 2022-23 budget and a reduction in Title I revenues.

In addition, the superintendent is recommending that the board approve the proposed change to the salary schedule for substitute administrators from $350 - $450 per day to $400 - $550 per day, effective January 1, 2022.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
On April 4, 2016, Governor Brown signed Senate Bill 3 which increases California’s minimum wage each year until it reaches $15.00 per hour in 2022. At this time, we are requesting approval to raise the pay rates for these designated positions to the January 2022.

San Juan Unified School District is experiencing challenges in substitute coverage for administrators. The proposed changes reflect an increase to the full day rates. The proposed changes will clarify current rates, which has created frustration for substitute administrators.

# San Juan Unified School District Mission

Valuing diversity and excellence, the San Juan Unified School District’s mission is to educate and inspire each student to succeed and responsibly contribute to a radically evolving world by providing innovative, rigorous, student-focused instruction and programs in a safe, caring and collaborative learning community.

## Shared Beliefs

We believe that:

- Every person is unique and has equal worth.
- Everyone can and will learn.
- People learn in different ways and at varied paces.
- Education is the shared responsibility of students, families, teachers, staff and community.
- Quality education expands opportunities throughout a person’s life.
- Challenging people to meet high expectations leads to exceptional learning and remarkable results.
- Nurturing relationships and healthy environments are necessary for individuals to thrive.
- Diversity is a valuable asset that strengthens and enriches our community.
- Personal development and community well-being depend on individual responsibility.
- Everyone benefits when people willingly contribute to the well-being of others.
- Honesty and integrity are essential to build trusting relationships.
- Access to a quality public education is essential to our democracy.

## District Overview

Created in 1960 with the merger of six school districts, San Juan Unified School District has a rich tradition in providing all students with the opportunity for academic success and achievement.

The district serves a 75-square-mile area covering the communities of Arden-Arcade, Carmichael, Citrus Heights, Fair Oaks, Gold River and Orangevale.

Today, San Juan Unified is the 10th largest school district in California with an expenditure budget of more than $500 million used to employ more than 5,000 individuals and to educate more than 50,000 students in our early learning, TK-12 and adult programs.

The district consists of 33 elementary schools, eight K-8 schools, nine middle schools, nine comprehensive high schools, three special-education centers, three alternative schools, one adult-education center, two Early Childhood Education centers and one dependent charter.

The student population is diverse. During the 2020-2021 school year, the district’s ethnic/racial makeup was: 0.6 percent American Indian or Alaskan Native, 25.4 percent Hispanic/Latino, 7.0 percent African American, 49.7 percent White, 7.8 percent Asian/Asian American, 0.6 percent Pacific Islander, 1.0 percent Filipino, 7.2 percent multi-race and 0.6 percent Not Reported.

![Roles and responsibilities of board members and the superintendent](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Roles+and+responsibilities+of+board+members+and+the+superintendent)

# Roles and responsibilities of board members and the superintendent

## Board Roles

The role of the board is to provide each student with an education of the highest possible quality within the limits of financial support provided by the State of California. To accomplish this, board members are responsible for five roles identified by the California School Boards Association (CSBA):

- **Setting the direction** for the district by involving parents/guardians, community, students and staff, while focusing on student learning and achievement.

- **Establishing an effective and efficient structure** by employing the superintendent, developing and adopting policies, establishing academic expectations and adopting curriculum and instructional materials, establishing budget priorities and adopting the budget, providing safe and adequate facilities to support student learning, and setting parameters for negotiations with employee organizations and ratifying collective bargaining agreements.

- **Providing support to the superintendent and staff** by following standards of responsible governance, making decisions and providing resources that support district priorities and goals, upholding board policies and being effective spokespersons by being knowledgeable about district programs and goals.

- **Ensuring accountability** through evaluation of the superintendent; monitoring and evaluating policies; serving as a judicial and appeals body; monitoring student achievement and program effectiveness; approving, monitoring and adjusting district budgets; and monitoring the collective bargaining process.

- **Providing community leadership and advocacy on behalf of students, the educational program and public**.

## Superintendent Roles

CSBA identifies the following standards and roles for superintendents working with the Board of Education:

- Promotes the success of all students and supports the efforts of the board to focus on student learning and achievement.

- Values, advocates and supports public education and all stakeholders.

- Recognizes and respects the different perspectives and styles of board members, staff, students, parents and community, ensuring the diverse range of views inform board decisions.

- Acts with dignity, treats everyone with civility and respect, and understands the implications of demeanor and behavior.

- Serves as a model for the value of lifelong learning and supports the board’s continuous professional development.

- Works with the board as a “governance team” and assures collective responsibility for building a unity of purpose, common vision and positive organizational culture.

- Recognizes that the board/superintendent governance relationship is supported by the district’s management team.

- Understands the distinctions between board and staff roles, and respects the roles of the board as the representative of the community.

- Understands that the authority rests with the board as a whole, provides guidance to the board to assist in decision making, and provides leadership based on the direction of the board as a whole.

- Communicates openly with trust and integrity, including providing all board members with equal access to information, and recognizes the importance of both responsive and anticipatory communications.

- Accepts leadership responsibility and accountability for implementing the vision, goals and policies of the district.
<!-- Page 271 -->
# Board Norms

The governance team commits to accomplishing these standards and roles through:

- Focusing on all students
- Adherence to the Brown Act
- Demonstrating respect
- Creating transparency
- Communicating openly
- Listening actively
- Keeping commitments
- Being collaborative
- Taking the time needed to govern effectively
- Encouraging everyone’s ideas and point of view

## Welcoming new members

The board president meets with each newly elected member individually to provide a copy of the Governance Handbook, the schedule of meetings, the format for meetings and governance team operations.

The superintendent meets with each newly elected member to provide an overview of the district and to introduce cabinet members and other staff who will be communicating with the board.

District legal counsel will give newly elected members a copy of the Brown Act and inform them they must conform to its requirements as if they had already assumed office.

The governance team attends the swearing-in ceremony and reception for the newly elected members.

## Annual Organizational Meeting

The annual organizational meeting will be held within the required 15-day period commencing on the second Friday in December.

At this meeting, the board shall
- Elect a clerk, vice president and president from its members.
- Establish the regular school board meeting dates and starting/ending times for the year.
- Appoint representatives to specific organizations and committees and
- Determine locations of board meetings (Board Bylaws 9320, 9140).

## Speaking with a common voice

All public statements in the name of the board are made by the board president or, if appropriate, by the superintendent or senior director of community relations.

When speaking to community groups, the media or to the public, individual board members have a responsibility to identify personal viewpoints as such and not as the viewpoint of the board.

When a board decision has been reached, all board members shall support that decision until it is amended or rescinded by board action. Any board member who may wish to criticize or oppose any specific board action should do so in an open board meeting.
<!-- Page 272 -->
![Assigning work to staff](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Assigning+work+to+staff)

**Assigning work to staff**  
No individual member of the board, by virtue of holding office, shall exercise any administrative responsibility with respect to the schools; nor as an individual, command the services of any employee. Board members are to channel their requests and/or concerns directly to the superintendent (or, if necessary, through the board president).

**Addressing conflict among board members**  
Because the governance team norms are designed to create an open, respectful, collaborative culture, members will engage in dialogue while welcoming an open discussion with different points of view. Members will demonstrate an ability to disagree on issues without taking the disagreements personally. Members will endeavor to maintain neutral body language and tone during deliberations.

**School visitations**  
School visitations are encouraged to build understanding of the district’s instructional programs, curriculum and staffs. Board members should make appointments with the school principal prior to visiting a campus. The board member should also email the board administrative assistant, so the visit can be placed on the board calendar alerting other members and the superintendent to the visit. This may prevent one school from having numerous visits from different board members during a short period of time. During visits, members should be cautious of interrupting the learning environment.

**Board Meetings**  

**Placing items on board agendas**  
Board members may place any item on the agenda no later than six days prior to the scheduled meeting date; however, to give staff time to prepare materials, it is helpful to make the request at a regularly scheduled meeting during the Future Agenda discussion.

**The role of board members during board meetings**  
The authority to direct action rests solely with the full board during public board meetings. A majority vote provides direction to the superintendent. By carefully reviewing the board packet prior to the board meeting, board members can contact the superintendent for questions about an item. All members share a common responsibility to ensure the Brown Act is followed.

**Individual board member’s request for information, materials or action**  
It is important for trustees to be well informed, as oversight of the district is one of the main functions of the board. Trustees recognize that they have no power as individuals to direct staff actions, and that compiling information in response to trustee requests can take staff away from their day-to-day operations of schools and the district. An individual board member will – insofar as possible – work to let the superintendent and staff know ahead of time when a request for information will be made in a public meeting, so the staff can be prepared to provide a thorough response. Staff will make every effort to ensure that board agenda items include thorough background and information. Requests for information not on the board agenda should be made to the superintendent who will ensure the appropriate staff person responds. All information provided by the administration in response to a request by a trustee shall be provided to all other trustees at the same time. Trustees should self-regulate the number of requests for information regarding issues not on the board agenda.
<!-- Page 273 -->
![Board meeting guidelines](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Board+meeting+guidelines)

**Board meeting guidelines**

It is important to recognize that a board meeting is the time for the board to do their work in public view. After staff input and public comment, board members are encouraged to ask questions and explain their thinking related to the topic at hand. The board president recognizes members who desire to speak, alternating so that all members have the opportunity to speak. There is not a time limit or limit to the number of questions or comments that a board member may make, but each board member should be respectful of giving other members the opportunity to speak. Nothing in this section will preclude members from speaking multiple times until all discussion is concluded.

Unless a point is important to further understanding of the immediate discussion, the board president will allow all other members to speak first and then add his/her comments or questions.

**Public comments**

Members of the public shall have an opportunity to address the board on any item of interest that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board (Education Code section 35145.4, Government Code section 54954.3). If the public comments on items not appearing on the posted board agenda, the board cannot take action or discuss the comments (Government Code section 54954.2), other than to briefly acknowledge the comments and, if desired, to ask staff for follow-up information.

**Voting**

A majority vote of all members of the board is necessary for the election of officers or for any other action by the board unless otherwise specified by law. Voting shall be by voice and the board administrative assistant records the votes by member, which is placed into the minutes of the meeting.

Unless otherwise provided by law, affirmative votes by a majority of the board’s membership are required to approve any action under consideration, regardless of the number of members present.

The board shall take no action outside of a public meeting except on those matters and under those conditions authorized for closed sessions (Government Code sections 54957, 54957.7; Board Bylaw 9323.2).

**Voting no or abstaining**

Each trustee respects the right of other trustees to vote “no” on an issue. Everyone agrees it is a courtesy to the governance team to explain the reasons for the “no” vote, either during deliberation or before casting the vote. Abstaining on a vote must be announced at the time the topic is first brought up and shall be based on one of the following: 1) the matter affects a close relative of the board member (Education Code section 35707); 2) the vote is to replace the board member’s position on the board (Education Code section 35178); or 3) “remote interests” as listed in Government Code section 1091. If a board member abstains, his/her abstention shall be considered to concur with the action taken by the majority of those who vote, whether affirmatively or negatively.

If a member was absent at the previous meeting, he/she will abstain from voting on the approval of that meeting’s minutes.

**Quorum**

A quorum is the minimum number of voting members who must be present at a properly called board meeting in order to conduct business in the name of the board, and is established when a majority of the board members (at least three of the filled positions) are in attendance (Education Code section 35164, Board Bylaw 9323).
<!-- Page 274 -->
# Additional Board Information

## Board-appointed/board-approved committees

Board members appoint community members to the Curriculum, Standards, Instructional and Student Services Committee and the Facilities Committee. Newly elected board members will be given the option to appoint their own committee members or continue with the current appointments.

Board members serve as the conduit between a board-appointed/board-approved committee and the board as a whole. Board members are not voting members of board-appointed/board-approved committees.

If a board member wants to attend a board-appointed/board-approved committee meeting of which he/she is not the board liaison, the board member should contact the board administrative assistant. This will eliminate the possibility of three or more board members being in attendance at the meeting.

## Electronic media

The Board of Trustees will use electronic media (e.g., email and texting) carefully to ensure that there is no violation of the Brown Act (Government Code sections 54950-54962). The Brown Act prohibits board members from exchanging information outside of a board meeting to:
- develop collective concurrence,
- advance or clarify an issue,
- facilitate agreement or compromise or
- advance an ultimate resolution.

The board recognizes that by using “Reply All” in email responses, the email:
- becomes part of the deliberative process,
- creates a public record and
- inhibits opportunity for any other two board members to have a conversation on a topic.

Board members will be aware of, and follow, district policy as it pertains to electronic communication. The district is subject to requests for public documents as provided by in the California Public Records Act (Government Code section 6250 et seq.). Public documents include emails and other correspondence from board members as well as from employees.

## Complaints from community/staff

When an issue is brought to a board member, the board member will use active listening to hear what the complaint or issue is. Board members need to remain cognizant of their responsibility for judicial review, staff and student confidentiality and due process when talking with the complainant.

Restate what the complainant has said to ensure that you have heard the information correctly. Ask the person what he/she would like the board member to do with the information and what the individual would like to see as a possible solution. Explain that you will be sharing the information with the superintendent.

Redirect the complainant to communicate with appropriate personnel and utilize the appropriate complaint procedure. Ask the individual to follow up if the problem isn’t resolved.

Notify the superintendent as soon as possible with details of the complaint.
