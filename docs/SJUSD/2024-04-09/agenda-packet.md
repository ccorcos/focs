**Bond Opinion Research Results (I-1)**  
Chief Operations Officer Frank Camarda introduced the topic, explaining that FM3 Research was hired to conduct a community opinion survey to assess the level of support for the district to move forward with a bond in November 2024. Mr. Camarda then introduced Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz & Associates (FM3 Research) Senior Vice President Lued Del Puppo, who gave a presentation on the key findings of a districtwide survey that was conducted during December 11-17, 2023. The survey involved 615 telephone and online interviews (in both English and Spanish) of likely November 2024 voters in the San Juan Unified School District. Ms. Del Puppo shared detailed information regarding the survey specifics and methodology used to gather feedback, as well as the mood of voters, key areas that resonate with voters, ballot language tested, the level of support for different bond amounts, areas of less importance to voters and the percentage levels in support of a potential bond measure. Ms. Del Puppo then presented a list of conclusions.

Board members asked questions and made comments, which Ms. Del Puppo and Mr. Camarda addressed. Ms. Creason inquired about the survey type, the sample population polled and athletic field lighting. Ms. Villaseca made comments regarding Assembly Bill 195 ballot label requirement, voter turnout and the timing of the polling. Mr. Hernandez expressed confidence that voters will be able to see the progress that has been made with district facilities with the last three bond measures. Ms. Kravchuk asked about the timing of the bond measure related to the upcoming presidential election.

Mr. Camarda then provided a timeline of next steps to determine if the bond measure is a viable path forward, which includes community engagement, some of which could be embedded into the already scheduled Facilities Master Plan community input meetings, and a tracking survey. Mr. Avey asked if the new Facilities Master Plan would be complete by the election, which Mr. Camarda said it would be close to being done and general costs would likely be available. Ms. Creason emphasized the importance of enhancing board members’ understanding of the potential bond measure and the Facilities Master Plan as they engage with community members. Mr. Hernandez inquired about board members serving on a bond committee. Ms. Costa highlighted the importance of ensuring that both school sites and board members are well-informed on the issue.

**Dress Code Policy Update (I-2)**  
Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Education and Programs Kristan Schnepp gave an update on the process for revising the student dress code policy, which began in 2019. Ms. Schnepp provided background information, discussed the need to create a consistent dress code policy and shared information about the dress code survey that was conducted. Additionally, Ms. Schnepp explained the convening of the dress code committee and the process the committee has undertaken since September 2022. Ms. Schnepp also provided information about the collaboration with labor partners, principal and vice principals. Lastly, Ms. Schnepp shared the communication plan to promote the upcoming public review period that will take place this spring, seeking to increase participation and gather feedback and input on the draft policy which will help to inform the final student dress code policy. Board members made comments and posed questions, with staff addressed.

Ms. Creason encouraged staff to provide some historical context at the community outreach meetings. Ms. Kravchuk expressed appreciation for the outreach and the effort to get the community involved and she inquired about some of the language in the dress code policy. Mr. Hernandez inquired about the language in the current dress code board policy, which Superintendent Bassanelli explained the intent is to bring back proposed revisions to Board Policy 5132 which would eliminate that wording.

The Second Interim Report reflects actual revenue and expenditures through January 31, 2024, forecasts the remainder of the 2023-2024 fiscal year, and provides a multi-year budget projection for years 2024-2025 and 2025-2026. Mr. Avey inquired about the COLA projections, which Mr. Ryan addressed.

The creation of this short-term assignment was board approved on January 23, 2024. This position originally ran from January 24, 2024, until April 15, 2024.

**AGENDA ITEM:**  I-1  
**MEETING DATE:**  04/09/2024  

**SUBJECT:**  Universal Prekindergarten (UPK) Update  
**DEPARTMENT:**  Division of Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board receive an update regarding the current progress for Universal Prekindergarten (UPK) in alignment with state legislation.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The purpose of this report is to update the board on the fourth year of UPK implementation and planning, which includes the expansion of services for 4-year-old students in transitional kindergarten (TK). The intent of UPK planning (through legislation) rests on five focus areas and recommends that all school districts form collaborative teams inclusive of multiple departments, labor partners, and school community members. Staff approached UPK planning by adhering to the recommendation of collaboration by involving more than five parent committees, labor partners, 15 district departments, and the parent community through surveys, listening sessions, and school site feedback.

Currently, there are 33 TK classes, with eight added at the beginning of the 2023-24 school year. The district will continue to expand TK classes through a phased approach, by adding additional classrooms each year through the 2025-26 school year when students who turn age four by September 1st will be eligible for TK. Newly added TK classroom schedules mirror the school kindergarten schedules to provide continuity and consistency in the early learning classrooms. Locations where TK will be added for 2024-25 are Carriage, Cambridge Heights, Carmichael, Deterding, Dewey, and Del Paso Manor Elementary Schools.

The UPK grant allocation is a one-time allocation intended to support school districts in the implementation process. As a part of supporting the UPK plan, the district is braiding funding sources from additional programs such as Expanded Learning Opportunity Programs (ELO-P) and the Work Force Development Grant in partnership with the Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE). The Work Force Development Grant is a program that supports the development of TK teachers while ELO-P funding supports opportunities for students to access an expanded school day through various programs. UPK implementation will continue to thrive as staff learns more through the years.

SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
BOARD OF EDUCATION  
AGENDA ITEM: I-2  
MEETING DATE: 04/09/2024  

**SUBJECT:** San Juan Choices Charter School On-Going Salary Schedule Adjustment  

**CHECK ONE:**  
For Discussion: ☒  
For Action: ☐  
Report: ☐  
Workshop: ☐  
Recognition: ☐  
Emergency Action: ☐  

**DEPARTMENT:** Admissions and Family Services  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board discuss the salary schedule adjustment for San Juan Choices Charter School. The adjustments for CCS are as follows:  
- ● All base salaries shall be increased by a total of 10.0%, effective July 1, 2023.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
San Juan Choices Charter School (CCS) attempts to, when fiscally possible, match the raises and bonuses the district provides to its own employees. On October 11, 2022, the board approved a salary schedule increase of 10% for the San Juan Teachers Association retroactive to July 1, 2022. Other bargaining groups within the district were also given a 10% salary schedule increase. Because of the timing of the district’s approval and due to a leadership change at CCS, the school was unable to make this request to the board before the end of the 2022-2023 fiscal year.  

CCS anticipates a stable enrollment pattern and moderate growth over the next three years which will ensure healthy financial reserves that will support quality programs and services while honoring the hard work of teachers and staff by providing competitive salaries.

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt Resolution No. 4125, accepting the 2024 Level I Developer Fee Justification Study.

---

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
At its meeting on January 24, 2024, the State Allocation Board (SAB) increased the statutory Level 1 fees by 7.84 percent, to $5.17 per square foot for residential construction and $0.84 per square foot for commercial construction. As per AB 602, newly added section 66016.5, school districts must adopt the study prior to adopting any associated development fee. Previously, the school district could adopt the impact fee nexus study simultaneously with the adopted fee amounts. School districts may adopt both the study and any corresponding fee adjustment at the same meeting, but the two items must be agendized separately.

Education Code section 17620 (AB 2926, Chapter 887/Statutes 1986) provides that “the Governing Board of any school district is authorized to levy a fee, charge, dedication, or other forms of requirement against any development project for the construction or reconstruction of school facilities.” To levy and collect developer fees, a school district must show the correlation (“nexus”) between new residential, commercial, and industrial development and the need for new or reconstructed school facilities.

Developer fees were originally established in 1987 with a maximum fee of $1.50 per square foot of new residential construction and $0.25 per square foot of new commercial/industrial construction. This maximum amount is reviewed and adjusted every two years by the SAB. Developer fees may be used to finance new schools and equipment and to reconstruct existing facilities in order to maintain adequate school facilities for district students. Other appropriate uses of developer fees include, but are not limited to interim housing, site acquisition, replacement of aged or inadequate portable classrooms and housing for class-size reduction. Up to three percent of the fees collected may be used to defray the administrative costs incurred by the district in collecting these fees. Uses of the fees that are specifically prohibited by law include: regular or routine maintenance of facilities, asbestos abatement incidental to construction or reconstruction and deferred maintenance programs.

## 2024 Developer Fee Justification Study  
### March 2024  

---

## Executive Summary  

This Developer Fee Justification Study demonstrates that the San Juan Unified School District requires the full statutory impact fee to accommodate impacts from development activity.  

A fee of $4.79 per square foot for residential construction and a fee of $0.78 per square foot for commercial/industrial construction is currently assessed on applicable permits pulled in the District. The new fee amounts are **$5.17** per square foot for residential construction and **$0.84** per square foot for commercial/industrial construction. This proposed increase represents $0.38 per square foot and $0.06 per square foot for residential and commercial/industrial construction, respectively.  

The following table shows the impacts of the new fee amounts:  

### Table 1  
#### San Juan Unified  
#### Developer Fee Collection Rates  

| Totals            | Previous | New   | Change |
|-------------------|----------|-------|--------|
| Residential       | $4.79    | $5.17 | $0.38  |
| Commercial/Ind.   | $0.78    | $0.84 | $0.06  |

*except for Rental Self Storage facilities in which a fee of $0.05 per square foot is justified.  

The total projected number of housing units to be built over the next five years is 945. The average area per unit is 1,885 square feet. This Study demonstrates a need of $5.31 per square foot for residential construction.

## 2024 Developer Fee Justification Study  
### March 2024  
**Attachment A**  

### Background  

Education Code Section 17620 allows school districts to assess fees on new and replacement residential and new and replacement commercial construction within their respective boundaries. These fees can be collected without special city or county approval, to fund the construction of new school facilities necessitated by the impact of residential and commercial development activity. In addition, these fees can also be used to fund the reconstruction of school facilities to accommodate students generated from new development projects. Fees are collected immediately prior to the time of the issuance of a building permit by the City or the County.  

As new development generates students, additional school facilities or modernization of existing facilities will be needed to house the new students. Because of the high cost associated with constructing school facilities and the District’s limited budget, outside funding sources are required for future school construction. State and local funding sources for the construction and/or reconstruction of school facilities are limited.  

The authority cited in Education Code Section 17620 states in part “… the governing board of any school district is authorized to levy a fee, charge, dedication or other form of requirement against any development project for the construction or reconstruction of school facilities.” The legislation originally established the maximum fee rates at $1.50 per square foot for residential construction and $0.25 per square foot for commercial/industrial construction. Government Code Section 65995 provides for an inflationary increase in the fees every two years based on the changes in the Class B construction index. As a result of these adjustments, the fees authorized by Education Code 17620 are currently $5.17 per square foot of residential construction and $0.84 per square foot of commercial or industrial construction.

## 2024 Developer Fee Justification Study
### March 2024

### Purpose and Intent

Prior to levying developer fees, a district must demonstrate and document that a reasonable relationship exists between the need for new or reconstructed school facilities and residential, commercial and industrial development. The justification for levying fees is required to address three basic links between the need for facilities and new development. These links or nexus are:

**Burden Nexus:** A district must identify the number of students anticipated to be generated by residential, commercial and industrial development. In addition, the district shall identify the school facility and cost impact of these students.

**Cost Nexus:** A district must demonstrate that the fees to be collected from residential, commercial and industrial development will not exceed the cost of providing school facilities for the students to be generated from the development.

**Benefit Nexus:** A district must show that the construction or reconstruction of school facilities to be funded by the collection of developer fees will benefit the students generated by residential, commercial and industrial development.

The purpose of this Study is to document if a reasonable relationship exists between residential, commercial and industrial development and the need for new and/or modernized facilities in the San Juan Unified School District.

Following in this Study will be figures indicating the current enrollment and the projected development occurring within the attendance boundaries of the San Juan Unified School District. The students generated will then be loaded into existing facilities to the extent of available space. Thereafter, the needed facilities will then be determined and an estimated cost will be assigned. The cost of the facilities will then be compared to the area of residential, commercial and industrial development to determine the amount of developer fees justified.

**Enrollment and Impacts**

In 2023/2024 the District’s total enrollment (CBEDS) was 38,488 students. The enrollment by grade level is shown here in Table 2.

**March 2024**  

### Student Generation Factor

In determining the impact of new development, the District is required to show how many students will be generated from the new developments. In order to ensure that new development is paying only for the impact of those students that are being generated by new homes and businesses, the student generation factor is applied to the number of new housing units to determine development-related impacts.

The same analysis and student generation rate applicable to new development is applicable to replacement residential and commercial development. In determining the impact of replacement development, the District is required to show how many students will be generated from the replacement developments. In order to ensure that replacement development is paying only for the impact of those students that are being generated by homes and businesses replacing other previously existing homes and businesses, the student generation factor is applied to the number of replacement housing units to determine development-related impacts.

The student generation factor identifies the number of students per housing unit and provides a link between residential construction projects and projections of enrollment. The State-wide factor used by the Office of Public School Construction is 0.70 for grades TK-12. For the purposes of this study we will use the local factors to determine the students generated from new housing developments. This was done by comparing the number of housing units in the school district to the number of students in the school district as of the 2020 Census. Table 3 shows the student generation factors for the various grade groupings.

### Table 3  
**San Juan Unified**  
**STUDENT GENERATION FACTORS**

| Grades | Students per Household |
|--------|------------------------|
| TK-6   | 0.14605                |
| 7-8    | 0.04344                |
| 9-12   | 0.08909                |
| **Total** | **0.27858**          |

**March 2024**

When using the Census data to determine the average district student yield rate, it is not possible to determine which students were living in multi-family units versus single family units. Therefore, only the total average yield rate is shown. The Census data does indicate that 57.6% of the total housing units within the district boundaries are single family units. It is reasonable to assume that the construction of new housing units would be similar to the current housing stock, which was confirmed by the various planning departments within the school district boundaries, and therefore the overall student generation rate will be used to determine student yields from the projected developments.

**New Residential Development Impacts**  
The San Juan Unified School District has experienced an average new residential construction rate of approximately 189 units per year over the past four years. This was determined by reviewing the residential permits pulled and school development impact fees paid to the District. After contacting each of the planning departments within the school district boundaries, it was determined that the residential construction rate over the next five years will average 189 units per year. Projecting the average rate forward, we would expect that 945 units of residential housing will be built within the District boundaries over the next five years as shown here:

**New Development Housing Projections**

| Planning Area          | # of Units |
|-----------------------|------------|
| City of Citrus Heights | 615        |
| Sacramento County      | 330        |
| **Total**             | **945**    |

To determine the impact of residential development, a student projection is done. Applying the student generation factor of 0.2786 to the projected 945 units of residential housing, we expect that 263 students will be generated from the new residential construction over the next five years. This includes 138 elementary school students, 41 middle school students, and 84 high school students.

The following table shows the projected impact of new development. The students generated by development will be utilized to determine the facility cost impacts to the school district.

**Table 4**  
**San Juan Unified**  
**DEVELOPMENT IMPACT ANALYSIS**

| Grades     | Generation Rate | Students Generated |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| TK to 6    | 0.1460          | 138                |
| 7 to 8     | 0.0434          | 41                 |
| 9 to 12    | 0.0891          | 84                 |
| **Totals** | **0.2786**      | **263**            |

**Existing Facility Capacity**  
To determine the need for additional school facilities, the capacity of the existing facilities must be identified and compared to current and anticipated enrollments. The District’s existing building capacity will be calculated using the State classroom loading standards shown in Table 6. The following types of “support-spaces” necessary for the conduct of the District’s comprehensive educational program, are not included as “teaching stations,” commonly known as “classrooms” to the public:

**Table 5**  
**List of Core and Support Facilities**

| Library            | Resource Specialist |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Multipurpose Room   | Gymnasium           |
| Office Area         | Lunch Room          |
| Staff Workroom      | P.E. Facilities     |

Because the District requires these types of support facilities as part of its existing facility and curriculum standards at its schools, new development’s impact must not materially or adversely affect the continuance of these standards. Therefore, new development cannot require that the District house students in these integral support spaces.

**Classroom Loading Standards**  
The following maximum classroom loading-factors are used to determine teaching-station “capacity,” in accordance with the State legislation and the State School Building Program. These

**Table 6**  
**State Classroom Loading Standards**  

| Grade Level         | Students/Classroom |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| TK/Kindergarten     | 25 Students/Classroom |
| 1st-3rd Grades      | 25 Students/Classroom |
| 4th-6th Grades      | 25 Students/Classroom |
| 7th-8th Grades      | 27 Students/Classroom |
| 9th-12th Grades     | 27 Students/Classroom |

**Existing Facility Capacity**  
The State determines the baseline capacity by either loading all permanent teaching stations plus a maximum number of portables equal to 25% of the number of permanent classrooms or by loading all permanent classrooms and only portables that are owned or have been leased for over 5 years. As allowed by law and required by the State, facility capacities are calculated by identifying the number of teaching stations at each campus. All qualified teaching stations were included in the calculation of the capacities at the time the initial inventory was calculated. To account for activity and changes since the baseline was established in 1998/99, the student grants (which represent the seats added either by new schools or additions to existing schools) for new construction projects funded by OPSC have been added. Using these guidelines the District’s current State calculated capacity is shown in Table 7.

### March 2024

The District has not participated in the State Building Program for any new construction projects and therefore has not established a State capacity as of this time. The State capacity can sometimes be lower than the District capacity as the State capacity limits the number of portable classrooms that are counted towards the total capacity.

As Table 7 shows, the total District capacity of the District facilities is 42,168 students.

### Unhoused Students by State Housing Standards
This next table compares the facility capacity with the space needed to determine if there is available space for new students from the projected developments. The space needed was determined by reviewing the historic enrollments over the past four years along with the projected enrollment in five years to determine the number of seats needed to house the students within the existing homes. The seats needed were determined individually for each grade grouping. The projected enrollment in the space needed analysis did not include the impact of any new housing units.

|-----------------|------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Grades TK-6     | 22,678           | 21,752       | 926                |
| Grades 7-8      | 6,263            | 6,031        | 232                |
| Grades 9-12     | 13,227           | 12,640       | 587                |
| **Totals**      | **42,168**       | **40,423**   | **1,745**          |

The District capacity of 42,168 is more than the space needed of 40,423, assuming the existing facilities remain in sufficient condition to maintain existing levels of service. The difference is 1,745 students.

### Calculation of Development’s Fiscal Impact on Schools
This section of the Study will demonstrate that a reasonable relationship exists between residential, commercial/industrial development and the need for school facilities in the San Juan Unified School District. To the extent this relationship exists, the District is justified in levying developer fees as authorized by Education Code Section 17620.

## New Construction Costs
The available capacity on the previous page indicates that additional new school facilities are not needed. Therefore, the costs for new schools or new classrooms at existing schools are not included in the study. However, it is possible that development in a specific area can exceed the capacity of the neighborhood school. In this instance the district may decide to build new facilities instead of housing students in a school that is farther away. In this case, the use of the fees is still justified as the students generated by the new development are being housed in new facilities which directly benefits the students from new development.

## Reconstruction/Modernization Costs
In addition to any new facilities needed, there is also a need to reconstruct or modernize existing facilities in order to maintain the existing levels of service as students from new development continue to arrive in the District’s facilities. In order to generate capacity, it may also be necessary to reopen closed school facilities. Such reopening often requires reconstruction in order to provide the District’s existing level of service. For purposes of this report, the analysis of modernization/reconstruction includes the possible reopening and refurbishing of closed or unused school facilities.

California has made a significant investment in school facilities through grants provided to help extend the useful life of public schools. The State’s largest funding source for public school modernization projects, the School Facilities Program (SFP), requires a minimum local funding contribution of 40% of SFP-eligible costs. The State may provide up to 60% of the eligible costs at those times that State funding is available. However, SFP modernization grants frequently, if not usually, fall short of providing 60% of the actual costs for major modernizations. In the best cases, developer fees can help meet the District’s required 40% local share. In many cases, developer fees may be necessary to supplement both the State’s and the school district’s contribution to a project.

Buildings generate eligibility for State reconstruction/modernization funding once they reach an age of 25 years old for permanent buildings and 20 years old for portables. The usable life of school facilities is an important consideration in determining district facility needs into the future. The specific time when the projected residential developments will be built cannot be precisely predicted. Some new homes may be immediately occupied by families with school aged children, while others may be immediately occupied who will have school-aged children in five to ten years. As a result of these variables, for each new home, the District must be prepared to house the students.

2024 Developer Fee Justification Study  
March 2024  

Attachment A  

As evidenced by the State Building program’s use of the criteria that buildings older than twenty-five years (and portables older than twenty years) are eligible for modernization funds, school buildings require reconstruction/modernization to remain in use for students beyond the initial twenty to twenty-five years of life of those buildings. To the extent that the District has buildings older than twenty to twenty-five years old, the point will be reached without reconstruction/modernization that those buildings will no longer be able to provide the existing level of service to students, and may, in some circumstances, need to be closed entirely for health and safety reasons. However, because of the new development, reconstruction/modernization must occur in order to have available school housing for the students generated from development.

The following table shows the District’s eligibility for modernization/reconstruction funding in the State Building Program.

San Juan Unified School District  
2024 Developer Fee Justification Study  
March 2024  

The District prepared a Facility Master Plan in 2014 that identified $554,508,067 in “Facility Condition Improvement Projects” plus an additional $837,574,311 in “Master Plan Improvement Projects”. The grand total facility needs identified were in excess of $2.4 billion. The identified facility needs exceed the eligibility for modernization projects in the State Building Program.

**New Development Share of Modernization Costs**  

| Eligible Modernization | New Development Impacts |  
|-----------------------|-------------------------|  
| Grade                 | Grants | Students | $/Student | Amount |  
| TK-6                  | 3,478  | 138     | $32,106   | $4,430,628 |  
| 7-8                   | 2,282  | 41      | $34,038   | $1,395,558 |

Includes students from new developments not housed in new facilities.  
Amounts based on State OPSC allowances for new construction projects.

This data is used to show that there are significant needs within the school District to invest in its existing facilities. Without modernizing its schools, the District could be forced to begin closing some of its buildings and schools.

To accurately account for the amount of the modernization projects attributed to the impact of new developments, only the students from new developments that were not already housed in new facilities are included in the net needs for modernization projects. As can be seen in the charts, the net modernization needs due to new development impacts are much less than the total District modernization needs.

**Impact of New Residential Development**  
This next table compares the development-related enrollment to the available district capacity for each grade level and then multiplies the unhoused students by the new school construction costs to determine the total school facility costs related to the impact of new residential housing developments.

The modernization needs are included for the students not housed in new facilities but who would be housed in existing facilities that are eligible for and need to be modernized to provide adequate housing and to maintain the existing level of service for the students generated by development.

### New Construction needs due to development:  
**$0**  

### Modernization needs due to development:  
**$9,453,642**  

### TOTAL DEVELOPMENT IMPACT:  
**$9,453,642**  

- **Average cost per student:** $35,945  
- **Total Residential Sq Ft:** 1,781,325  
- **Residential Fee Justified:** $5.31  

The total need for school facilities based solely on the impact of the 945 new housing units projected over the next five years totals $9,453,642. To determine the impact per square foot of residential development, this amount is divided by the total square feet of the projected developments. As calculated from the historic Developer Fee Permits, the average size home built has averaged 1,885 square feet. The total area for 945 new homes would therefore be 1,781,325 square feet. The total residential fee needed to be able to collect $9,453,642 would be $5.31 per square foot.  

### Impact of Other Residential Development  
In addition to new residential development projects that typically include new single family homes and new multi-family units, the District can also be impacted by additional types of new development projects. These include but are not limited to redevelopment projects, additions to existing housing units, and replacement of existing housings units with new housing units.

These development projects are still residential projects and therefore it is reasonable to assume they would have the same monetary impacts per square foot as the new residential development projects. However, the net impact is reduced due to the fact that there was a previous residential building in its place. Therefore, the development impact fees should only be charged for other residential developments if the new building(s) exceed the square footage area of the previous building(s). If the new building is larger than the existing building, then it is reasonable to assume that additional students could be generated by the project. The project would only pay for the development impact fees for the net increase in assessable space generated by the development project. Education Code allows for an exemption from development impacts fees for any additions to existing residential structures that are 500 square feet or less.

Pursuant to the above, in situations where there is no increase in square footage of the replacement development, if student yield rates of the replacement development are equal to or less than the student yield rates of the preexisting development, then there are no additional students and therefore no fee may be charged on the replacement development. In contrast, if one or more of the student yield rates of the replacement development is greater than the student yield rates of the preexisting development, then there are additional students and cost impacts, and therefore a fee may be charged on the replacement development.

**Impact of Commercial/Industrial Development**  
There is a correlation between the growth of commercial/industrial firms/facilities within a community and the generation of school students within most business service areas. Fees for commercial/industrial can only be imposed if the residential fees will not fully mitigate the cost of providing school facilities to students from new development.

The approach utilized in this section is to apply statutory standards, U.S. Census employment statistics, and local statistics to determine the impact of future commercial/industrial development projects on the District. Many of the factors used in this analysis were taken from the U.S. Census, which remains the most complete and authoritative source of information on the community in addition to the “1990 SanDAG Traffic Generators Report”.

**Employees per Square Foot of Commercial Development**  
Results from a survey published by the San Diego Association of Governments “1990 San DAG Traffic Generators” are used to establish numbers of employees per square foot of building area to be

*Source: 1990 SanDAG Traffic Generators report*

The number of students per employee is determined by using the S0802: Means of Transportation to Work by Selected Characteristics 2018-2022 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates and DP1: Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics 2020: DEC Demographic Profile for the District. There were 162,451 employees and 141,593 homes in the District. This represents a ratio of 1.1473 employees per home.

There were 39,445 school age children attending the District in 2020. This is a ratio of 0.2428 students per employee. This ratio, however, must be reduced by only including the percentage of employees that worked in their community of residence (35.5%), because only those employees living in the District will impact the District’s school facilities with their children. The net ratio of students per employee in the District is 0.0862.

**School Facilities Cost per Student**

Facility costs for housing commercially generated students are the same as those used for residential construction. The cost factors used to assess the impact from commercial development projects are contained in Table 11.

**Residential Offset**  
When additional employees are generated in the District as a result of new or replacement commercial/industrial development, fees will also be charged on the residential units necessary to provide housing for the employees living in the District. To prevent a commercial or industrial development from paying for the portion of the impact that will be covered by the residential fee, this amount has been calculated and deducted from each category. The residential offset amount is calculated by multiplying the following factors together and dividing by 1,000 (to convert from cost per 1,000 square feet to cost per square foot).

- Employees per 1,000 square feet (varies from a low of 0.06 for rental self storage to a high of 4.79 for office building).
- Percentage of employees that worked in their community of residence (35.5 percent).
- Housing units per employee (0.8716). This was derived from the 2018-2022 ACS 5 Year Estimates and DP1 data for the District, which indicates there were 141,593 housing units and 162,451 employees.
- Percentage of employees that will occupy new housing units (75 percent).
- Average square feet per dwelling unit (1,885).
- Residential fee charged by the District ($5.17 per square foot).
- Average cost per student was determined in Table 11.

The following table shows the calculation of the school facility costs generated by a square foot of new commercial/industrial development for each category of development.

**Net Cost per Square Foot**  
Since the State Maximum Fee is now $0.84 for commercial/industrial construction, the District is justified in collecting the maximum fee for all categories with the exception of Rental Self Storage. The District can only justify collection of $0.05 per square foot of Rental Self Storage construction.

**Impact of Replacement/Reconstruction Projects**  
This section provides clarification for the process of charging fees for projects that consist of replacement of existing structures with new buildings.

**Residential to Residential:** When a residential building is replaced with a residential building, the regulations state that the school impact fees will only be charged for the net increase in area if the net increase is greater than 500 square feet.

**Commercial to Commercial:** When a commercial building is replaced with a commercial building, the impact fees charged will be for the net increase in building area and when such increase is linked to an increase in students generated by the replacement development compared to the preexisting development. Fees may also be charged when there is no net increase in building area but there is an increase in the students to be generated by the replacement development when compared to the preexisting development. In order for the new building to get credit for the area of the existing building to be demolished, it needs to be in existence when the building permit for the replacement building is issued.

Table 13 illustrates the students generated per 1,000 square feet by the various types of commercial developments. When one type of development is being replaced by a type that generates more students, then there is an increase in students generated that results in the justification of development fees for the projects impact on schools. By comparing the net cost impacts between the two types of construction as shown in the table, then the difference between the two rates is the net increase in impact. That amount would be the fee that would be charged for commercial replacement projects with a not to exceed amount of $0.84 which is the current maximum commercial rate.

**Commercial to Residential:** When a commercial building is replaced with residential construction, the school impact fees should be an amount equal to the difference between the current residential and current commercial rates for up to the total area of the existing commercial building(s). Any construction area that exceeds the area of the existing buildings will be subject to the standard.

**Residential Fees:** This process gives a credit for the school impacts of the commercial buildings. The net school impact fees paid will address the increased impact of residential construction as compared to commercial construction. The net charge for conversion of commercial space to residential space is $5.17 (residential) - $0.84 (commercial) = $4.33 per square foot. This same impact fee process is charged when senior housing complexes (which are charged commercial rates) are converted to standard residential units.

**Residential to Commercial:** When a residential building is replaced with a commercial building, no impact fees may be charged unless the students generated by the replacement development is shown to be greater than the preexisting development. In order for the new building to get credit for the area of the existing building to be demolished, it needs to be in existence when the building permit for the replacement building is issued.

Each of these specific situations result in the collection of development impact fees in order to address the net increase in impacts on school district facilities as a result of the development project. The methodology the District would use to justify the imposition of fees on replacement developments is illustrated in Appendix F to this Study. Where replacement projects do not fall into any of the categories identified in this Study, those projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

**Verifying the Sufficiency of the Development Impact:** Education Code Section 17620 requires districts to find that fee revenues will not exceed the cost of providing school facilities to the students generated by the development paying the fees. This section shows that the fee revenues do not exceed the impact of the new development.

The total need for school facilities resulting from new development totals $9,453,642. The amount the District would collect over the five year period at the maximum rate of $5.17 for residential and $0.84 for commercial/industrial development would be as follows:
- $5.17 x 945 homes x 1,885 sq ft per home = $9,209,450 for Residential
- $0.84 x 50,000 sq ft per year x 5 years = $210,000 for Commercial/Industrial

**Total projected 5 year income:** $9,419,450

The estimated income is less than the projected facility needs due to the impact of new development projects.

# San Juan Unified School District  
## 2024 Developer Fee Justification Study  
### March 2024  

### Conclusion  

Based on the data contained in this Study, it is found that a reasonable relationship exists between residential, commercial/industrial development and the need for school facilities in the San Juan Unified School District. The following three nexus tests required to show justification for levying fees have been met:  

**Burden Nexus:** New and replacement residential development will generate an average of 0.2786 TK-12 grade students per unit. Because the District does not have adequate facilities for all the students generated by new developments, the District will need to build additional facilities and/or modernize/reconstruct the existing facilities in order to maintain the existing level of services in which the new students will be housed.  

**Cost Nexus:** The cost to provide new and reconstructed facilities is an average of $5.31 per square foot of residential development. Each square foot of residential development will generate $5.17 in developer fees resulting in a shortfall of $0.14 per square foot.  

**Benefit Nexus:** The developer fees to be collected by the San Juan Unified School District will be used for the provision of new and reconstructed or modernized school facilities. This will benefit the students to be generated by new and replacement development by providing them with adequate educational school facilities.  

The District’s planned use of the fees received from development impacts will include the following types of projects, each of which will benefit students from new developments.  

1. **New Schools:** When there is enough development activity occurring in a single area, the District will build a new school to house the students from new developments.  

2. **Additions to Existing Schools:** When infill development occurs, the District will accommodate students at existing schools by building needed classrooms and/or support facilities such as cafeterias, restrooms, gyms and libraries as needed to increase the school capacity. Schools may also need upgrades of the technology and tele-communication systems to be able to increase their capacity.

3) **Portable Replacement Projects:** Some of the District’s capacity is in portables and therefore may not be included in the State’s capacity calculations. These portables can be replaced with new permanent or modular classrooms to provide adequate space for students from new developments. These projects result in an increase to the facility capacity according to State standards. In addition, old portables that have reached the end of their life expectancy will need to be replaced to maintain the existing level of service. These types of projects are considered modernization projects in the State Building Program. If development impacts did not exist, the old portables could be removed.

4) **Modernization/Upgrade Projects:** In many cases, students from new developments are not located in areas where new schools are planned to be built. The District plans to modernize or upgrade older schools to be equivalent to new schools so students will be housed in equitable facilities to those students housed in new schools. These projects may include updates to the building structures to meet current building standards, along with upgrades to the current fire and safety standards and any access compliance standards.

The District plans to use the developer fees on the projects in their Facility Master Plan that in 2014 identified $554,508,067 in “Facility Condition Improvement Projects” plus an additional $837,574,311 in “Master Plan Improvement Projects”. The grand total facility needs identified were in excess of $2.4 billion.

The reasonable relationship identified by these findings provides the required justification for the San Juan Unified School District to levy the maximum fees of **$5.17 per square foot for residential construction** and **$0.84 per square foot for commercial/industrial construction**, except for Rental Self Storage facilities in which a fee of **$0.05 per square foot** is justified as authorized by Education Code Section 17620.

**Table ID:** DP1  

Note: For information on data collection, confidentiality protection, nonsampling error, subject definitions, and guidance on using the data, visit the 2C Census Demographic and Housing Characteristics File (DHC) Technical Documentation webpage.

To protect respondent confidentiality, data have undergone disclosure avoidance methods which add "statistical noise" - small, random additions or subtractions - to the data so that no one can reliably link the published data to a specific person or household. The Census Bureau encourages data users to aggregate small populations and geographies to improve accuracy and diminish implausible results.

An "(X)" means not applicable.

An "–" means the statistic could not be computed because there were an insufficient number of observations.

[1] The alone or in combination categories are tallies of responses rather than respondents. That is, the alone or in combination categories are not mutually exclusive. Individuals who reported two races were counted in two separate and distinct alone or in combination race categories, while those who reported three races were counted in three categories, and so on. For example, a respondent who indicated "White and Black or African American" was counted in the White alone or in combination category as well as in the Black or African American alone or in combination category. Consequently, the sum of all alone or in combination categories equals the number of races reported (i.e., responses), which exceeds the total population.

[2] "Child" includes biological, adopted, and stepchildren of the householder.

[3] "Own children" includes biological, adopted, and stepchildren of the householder.

[4] The homeowner vacancy rate is the proportion of the homeowner inventory that is vacant "for sale." It is computed by dividing the total number of vacant units "for sale only" by the sum of owner-occupied units, vacant units that are "for sale only," and vacant units that have been sold but not yet occupied; and then multiplying by 100.

[5] The rental vacancy rate is the proportion of the rental inventory that is vacant "for rent." It is computed by dividing the total number of vacant units "for rent" by the sum of the renter-occupied units, vacant units that are "for rent," and vacant units that have been rented but not yet occupied; and then multiplying by 100.

**Year:** 2022  
**Estimates:** 5-Year  
**Table ID:** DP04  

Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, the decennial census is the official source of population totals for April 1st of each decennial year. In between censuses, the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

Information about the American Community Survey (ACS) can be found on the ACS website.

Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see ACS Technical Documentation). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.

Households not paying cash rent are excluded from the calculation of median gross rent.

Telephone service data are not available for certain geographic areas due to problems with data collection of this question that occurred in 2019. Both ACS 1-year and ACS 5-year files were affected may take several years in the ACS 5-year files until the estimates are available for the geographic areas affected.

The 2018-2022 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the March 2020 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineations of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. In certain instances, the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB delineation lists due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.

Estimates of urban and rural populations, housing units, and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on 2020 Census data. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization.

**Explanation of Symbols:**
- The estimate could not be computed because there were an insufficient number of sample observations. For a ratio of medians estimate, one or both of the median estimates falls in the lowest interval or highest interval of an open-ended distribution. For a 5-year median estimate, the margin of error associated with a median was larger than the median itself.

A margin of error is not appropriate because the corresponding estimate is controlled to an independent population or housing estimate. Effectively, the corresponding estimate has no sampling error and the margin of error may be treated as zero.

**Survey/Program:** American Community Survey  
**Year:** 2022  
**Estimates:** 5-Year  
**Table ID:** S0802  

Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, the decennial census is the official source of population totals for April 1st of each decennial year. In between censuses, the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program produces and disseminates the official estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and estimates of housing units for states and counties.

Information about the American Community Survey (ACS) can be found on the ACS website. Supporting documentation including code lists, subject definitions, data accuracy, and statistical testing, and a full list of ACS tables and table shells (without estimates) can be found on the Technical Documentation section of the ACS website.

Sample size and data quality measures (including coverage rates, allocation rates, and response rates) can be found on the American Community Survey website in the Methodology section.

Foreign born excludes people born outside the United States to a parent who is a U.S. citizen.

Workers include members of the Armed Forces and civilians who were at work last week.

Industry titles and their 4-digit codes are based on the 2017 North American Industry Classification System. The industry categories adhere to the guidelines issued in Clarification Memorandum No. "NAICS Alternate Aggregation Structure for Use By U.S. Statistical Agencies," issued by the Office of Management and Budget.

Occupation titles and their 4-digit codes are based on the 2018 Standard Occupational Classification.

When information is missing or inconsistent, the Census Bureau logically assigns an acceptable value using the response to a related question or questions. If a logical assignment is not possible, data are filled using a statistical process called allocation, which uses a similar individual or household to provide a donor value. The "Allocated" section is the number of respondents who received an allocated value for a particular subject.

Several means of transportation to work categories were updated in 2019. For more information, see: Change to Means of Transportation.

In 2019, methodological changes were made to the class of worker question. These changes involved modifications to the question wording, the category wording, and the visual format of the categories on the questionnaire. The format for the class of worker categories are now listed under the headings "Private Sector Employee," "Government Employee," and "Self-Employed or Other." Additionally, the category of Active Duty was added as one of the response categories under the "Government Employee" section for the mail questionnaire. For more detailed information about the

### Use of Developer Fees:

A School District can use the revenue collected on residential and commercial/industrial construction for the purposes listed below:

- Purchase or lease of interim school facilities to house students generated by new development pending the construction of permanent facilities.
- Purchase or lease of land for school facilities for such students.
- Acquisition of school facilities for such students, including:
  - Construction
  - Modernization/reconstruction
  - Architectural and engineering costs
  - Permits and plan checking
  - Testing and inspection
  - Furniture, Equipment and Technology for use in school facilities
- Legal and other administrative costs related to the provision of such new facilities
- Administration of the collection of, and justification for, such fees, and
- Any other purpose arising from the process of providing facilities for students generated by new development.

Following is an excerpt from the Education Code that states the valid uses of the Level 1 developer fees. It refers to construction and reconstruction. The term reconstruction was originally used in the Leroy Greene program. The term modernization is currently used in the 1998 State Building Program and represents the same scope of work used in the original reconstruction projects.

**Ed Code Section 17620.**  
(a) (1) The governing board of any school district is authorized to levy a fee, charge, dedication, or other requirement against any construction within the boundaries of the district, for the purpose of funding the construction or reconstruction of school facilities, subject to any limitations set forth in Chapter 4.9 (commencing with Section 65995) of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code. This fee, charge, dedication, or other requirement may be applied to construction only as follows: …

The limitations referred to in this text describe the maximum amounts that can be charged for residential and commercial/industrial projects and any projects that qualify for exemptions. They do not limit the use of the funds received.

# REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER  
State Allocation Board Meeting, January 24, 2024  

## INDEX ADJUSTMENT ON THE ASSESSMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT  

### PURPOSE OF REPORT  
To report the index adjustment on the assessment for development, which may be levied pursuant to Education Code Section 17620.  

### DESCRIPTION  
The law requires the maximum assessment for development be adjusted every two years by the change in the Class B construction cost index, as determined by the State Allocation Board (Board) in each calendar year. This item requests that the Board make the adjustment based on the change reflected using the RS Means index.  

### AUTHORITY  
Education Code Section 17620(a)(1) states the following: “The governing board of any school district is authorized to levy a fee, charge, dedication, or other requirement against any construction within the boundaries of the district, for the purpose of funding the construction or reconstruction of school facilities, subject to any limitations set forth in Chapter 4.9 (commencing with Section 65995) of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code.”  

Government Code Section 65995(b)(3) states the following: “The amount of the limits set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be increased in 2000, and every two years thereafter, according to the adjustment for inflation set forth in the statewide cost index for class B construction, as determined by the State Allocation Board at its January meeting, which increase shall be effective as of the date of that meeting.”  

### BACKGROUND  
There are three levels that may be levied for developer’s fees. The fees are levied on a per-square foot basis. The lowest fee, Level I, is assessed if the district conducts a Justification Study that establishes the connection between the development coming into the district and the assessment of fees to pay for the cost of the facilities needed to house future students. The Level II fee is assessed if a district makes a timely application to the Board for new construction funding, conducts a School Facility Needs Analysis pursuant to Government Code Section 65995.6, and satisfies at least two of the requirements listed in Government Code Section 65995.5(b)(3). The Level III fee is assessed when State bond funds are exhausted; the district may impose a developer’s fee up to 100 percent of the School Facility Program new construction project cost.

# Appendix F

## Impacts of the Sunrise Tomorrow Specific Plan

This planned development would replace the current mall area with a variety of buildings with various uses.

The current development plans indicate the following maximum areas:

- **Residential** = 2,220 units
- **Hotel** = 480 rooms
- **Retail** = 320,000 square feet
- **Office** = 960,000 square feet
- **Community/Institutional** = 450,000 square feet

The net fee on the residential portion of the replacement development is calculated by providing a credit for the commercial development being replaced and subtracting that credit from the current residential rate for new development, resulting in a net fee that reflects the additional impact created by replacing commercial development with residential development. Residential development would be subject to a net fee of $5.17 (residential rate) - 0.84 (commercial rate) = **$4.33 per square foot** for the area of the prior Sunrise Mall that is replaced with residential development. For any portion of the residential development that is identified as senior only and meets the requirements of a senior only development, the rate would only be **$0.84 per square foot** as it qualifies for a discounted rate equal to the commercial fee. For any portion of the residential development that is in excess of the original building area of the existing buildings, the standard rates for new development would apply.

Hotel development is considered commercial development and generates an impact of **$0.94 per square foot** (see “Lodging” in Table 13). However, the mall had an impact of **$1.28 per square foot** (see “Community Shopping Center” in Table 13). Therefore, the hotel development areas would not generate an increased impacts on the school district and would not be subject to a development impact fee for the portion of the area of the project that is replacing the existing area of the mall. For any portions that are in excess of the current mall area, the standard fee of **$0.84 per square foot** would apply.

Retail development would generate an impact of **$2.27 per square foot** (see “Neighborhood Shopping Center” in Table 13). After subtracting the Mall’s impact of **$1.28**, there is a net impact of **$0.99 per square foot**. Since the maximum allowable rate is currently **$0.84** this category of development would be subject to a fee of **$0.84 per square foot**.

Office spaces generate an impact that ranges from **$2.25 to $4.01 per square foot**. The net impact after deducting the current mall amount of **$1.28 per square foot** results in a range of **$0.97 to $2.73 per square foot**. Therefore, office spaces would be subject to the current maximum allowable rate of **$0.84 per square foot**.

Community/Institutional spaces include child care centers, gyms, and community centers based on the description in the specific plan. These types of spaces would have a net impact of **$0.84 per square foot**.

The total planned development will likely exceed the existing mall area of **1,100,000 square feet**.

In the event the specifications of this planned development and the proposed use of space is modified by the developer, the District reserves the right to adjust its imposition of fees accordingly in order to ensure the burden created on the District by the development is mitigated.

Exemption with the County Clerk pursuant to California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15062.

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Board makes the following findings:

1. Prior to the adoption of this resolution (“Resolution”), the Board of the District conducted a public hearing at which oral and/or written presentations were made as part of the Board’s regularly scheduled meeting. Notice of the time and place of the meeting, including a general explanation of the matter to be considered has been published twice in the newspaper in accordance with Government Code sections 66017 and 66018. Additionally, at least 10 days prior to the meeting, the District made all relevant information available to the public indicating the cost, or estimated cost, of the construction or reconstruction of school facilities made necessary by the residential and/or commercial/industrial development to which the fee shall apply.

2. The purpose of the fees is to provide adequate school facilities for the students of the District who will be generated by residential and commercial/industrial development in the District.

3. The fees are to be used to finance the construction and reconstruction of school facilities.

4. There is a reasonable relationship between the need for the imposition of the fee and the types of development projects upon which the fees shall be imposed for the purpose of the construction or reconstruction of school facilities, in that residential, commercial and industrial development will generate students who will attend District schools. These students cannot be housed by the District.

## PERMISSIBLE USES OF DEVELOPER FEES

Developer fees may be used for the following purposes:

- Construction or reconstruction of school facilities. (Ed. Code, § 17620(a).)
- Costs associated with conducting the meeting(s) required for levying a new fee or increasing an existing fee. (Gov. Code, § 66016(c).)
- Costs attributable to the increased demand for public facilities reasonably related to the development in order to: (1) refurbish existing facilities to maintain the existing level of service or (2) achieve an adopted level of service that is consistent with a general plan. (Gov. Code, § 66001(g).)

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
## BOARD OF EDUCATION

### AGENDA ITEM: I-4
### MEETING DATE: 04/09/2024

---

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing on Adoption of Increase  
In District Developer Fees  

**DEPARTMENT:** Facilities  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board hold a public hearing for comment and adopt Resolution No. 4126, updating the district’s statutory developer fees pursuant to Education Code section 17620 and declaring the change in fees as exempt from the provisions of California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

---

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Education Code section 17620 (AB 2926, Chapter 887/Statutes 1986) provides that “the Governing Board of any school district is authorized to levy a fee, charge, dedication, or other forms of requirement against any development project for the construction or reconstruction of school facilities.” To levy and collect developer fees, a school district must show the correlation (or “nexus”) between new residential, commercial and industrial development and the need for new or reconstructed school facilities.

SchoolWorks was retained by the district to prepare a developer fee justification study to identify if the district could meet the nexus tests necessary to levy the current state maximum developer fee rates. Upon completion of the study, SchoolWorks found the district met the nexus tests to collect the maximum fees. A summary of these findings is provided below:

### Establishment of a Cost Nexus
The district will collect fees on new residential and commercial/industrial development to fund the construction and/or reconstruction of school facilities to serve students generated by such projects. The district has undertaken significant reconstruction and modernization projects to serve development and improve existing facilities. Additionally, the cost for providing these facilities exceeds the amount of developer fees to be collected. It is clear when educational facilities are provided for students generated by new residential, commercial and industrial development, the cost of new facilities exceeds developer fee generation, thereby establishing a cost nexus. The developer fee justification study found each square foot of residential construction creates a school facilities cost of $5.17 (current state maximum fee is $4.79), each square foot of non-rental self-storage commercial/industrial creates a school facilities cost exceeding the maximum fee of $0.84 per square foot, and rental self-storage creates a school facilities cost of $0.05 per square foot.

### Establishment of a Benefit Nexus
Students generated by new residential, commercial and industrial development will be attending the district’s schools. Housing district students in new and/or reconstructed facilities will directly benefit those students from the new development projects upon which the fee is imposed; therefore, a benefit nexus exists.

### Establishment of a Burden Nexus
The generation of students by new development will create a need for additional and/or reconstructed school facilities. The district must carry the burden of constructing new facilities required by the students generated by future development, and the need for facilities will be, in part, satisfied by the

**California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)**  
Education Code section 17621 specifically exempts fees pursuant to Education Code section 17620 (statutory developer fees) from the provisions of the CEQA. Therefore, the district is not required to conduct any environmental review for this action. If the board adopts the proposed fee, staff will file the attached Notice of Exemption (NOE) with the county for a 30-day public posting, which will trigger a 35-day statute of limitations for any litigation under CEQA challenging the fee adoption. If no NOE is filed, the statute of limitations would be 180 days from the date of approval.

4. There is a reasonable relationship between the need for the imposition of the fee and the types of development projects upon which the fees shall be imposed for the purpose of the construction or reconstruction of school facilities, in that residential, commercial and industrial development will generate students who will attend District schools. These students cannot be housed by the District without additional school facilities, or the reconstruction of existing school facilities. The fees will be used to fund all, or a portion of, new school facilities, or to reconstruct existing school facilities.

5. There is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost of the additional or reconstructed school facilities attributable to the development upon which the fee shall be imposed, in that the square footage of these developments has a direct relationship to the number of students that will be generated, and thus to the facilities the District must add and/or reconstruct in order to accommodate the additional students.

6. The District maintains a separate capital facilities account, or fund, as required by Government Code section 66006.

7. There are no other adequate sources of funds to meet the District’s school facilities needs occasioned by, and resulting from, the construction of new residential and/or commercial/industrial development within the District.

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that since the Study justifies fees at limits, the District hereby increases fees on residential development to $5.17 per square foot, and fees on commercial/industrial developments to $0.84 per square foot, in accordance with Education Code sections 17620, et seq., and Government Code sections 65995, et seq. except for Rental Self Storage facilities in which a fee of $0.05 per square foot is justified.
<!-- Page 99 -->
AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the imposition of and increase in fees shall take effect sixty (60) days after the date of this Resolution.

AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Superintendent of the District, or his or her designee, shall give notice of the Board’s action herein to all cities and counties with jurisdiction over the territory of the District in accordance with the requirements of Education Code section 17620 and 17621, requesting that no building permits (or, for manufactured homes and mobile homes, certificates of occupancy) be issued on or after the date which is sixty (60) days after the date of this Resolution, without certification from the District that the fee specified herein have been paid. Said notice shall specify that collection of the fees is not subject to the restriction set forth in Government Code section 66007, subdivision (a) but, pursuant to subdivision (b) of that statute, the fees are to be collected prior to issuance of building permits.

At its March 5, 2023, meeting, the Facilities Committee held a discussion and decided to form an ad hoc committee to explore the topic further. The ad hoc committee members provided updates to the Facilities Committee monthly, and during the February 6, 2024, Facilities Committee meeting, members voted unanimously to present a recommendation to the board during the February 13, 2024, board meeting.

Tonight, staff will present the board with a presentation on non-permitted use of facilities to provide the board with context to aid in the discussion.

![Legal Exposure A/C Memorandum Executive Summary & Conclusion](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Legal+Exposure+A/C+Memorandum+Executive+Summary+%26+Conclusion)

**Executive Summary**  
The Civic Center Act provides a statutory framework for the public's use of District facilities and how they may be regulated. The District's Facility Use Handbook and adopted Board Policies enact the regulations included in the Civic Center Act and provide a robust set of procedures and fees for the use of District facilities. Allowing the public to use District facilities outside of these formal avenues exposes the District to the risk of non-compliance with the law, District policies and procedures, and liability for injury and damage.

**Conclusion**  
Modifying District policy to provide for an open campus model increases the risks and liabilities to the District. One way to mitigate these risks is to create and implement policies and procedures that control access and use of facilities. Such policies and procedures already exist in the form of the Handbook and the District’s permitting system. District facilities are currently accessible to members of the public, such use is simply managed to ensure the facilities are properly maintained, and that public use does not endanger District staff or students. The District's approach in this regard is standard practice amongst many large school districts in the state. Generally, school districts do not allow unrestricted access to facilities due to the potential risk to District students and the District itself.

**Use of School Facilities**  
Thank you for your interest in using San Juan Unified School District (“SJUSD”) facilities. SJUSD works with hundreds of community organizations to make available school buildings/grounds for public, literary, scientific, recreational, or educational meetings, or for the discussion of matters of general or public interest.  

The handbook is designed to help users of SJUSD facilities to determine if their event/program qualifies to use school facilities, how to submit a permit request, an overview of the fee structure, review of the insurance requirements and other important information. We encourage you to read the entire handbook before submitting your permit request.  

We hope you find this information helpful in processing your permit request. If you have any suggestions for improvement, please email us at FacilitiesUse@sanjuan.edu.  

This facilities handbook follows the applicable law as defined in the California Education Code sections 10900 through 10914.5 and sections 38130 through 38138, referred to as the “Civic Center Act”.

2. The discussion of matters of general or public interest.
3. The conduct of religious services for temporary periods, on a one-time basis or renewal basis, by any church or religious organization.

9. Other purposes deemed appropriate by the governing board.
10. State laws prohibit the use of school facilities and grounds for subversive, immoral, offensive, or harmful purposes. State laws also limit the use of the school facilities and grounds for denominational or sectarian activities. The use of the school facilities and grounds shall not be granted to persons, forums, corporations, groups, or associations which:
    (a) May, by use, be reasonably expected to expose the property of SJUSD to damage through riot, mob action, or violence of any kind.
    (b) Use the property in a manner which will be adverse to the best interest of SJUSD.
    (c) Use of facilities and grounds for a purpose not consistent with the Civic Center Act and/or adopted Board Policies.
11. Groups or persons using school facilities and grounds under the provisions of this policy shall be liable for any property damages caused by the activity. The Board shall charge the amount necessary to repair the damages and may deny the group further use of the school facilities and grounds (Education Code § 38134).

**Food Handling Requirements in Concession Stands/Snack Bar**

All Concession Stands/Snack bar use will require a Manager Certification and each person working in the concession stand/snack bar will need a food handling certificate to be uploaded into the Use of Facilities online system for use. Each person working in the snack bar will be required to have their food handling certificate on them. Any violations and/or fines assessed to the school district will be charged to the user group and may affect future use of the facilities.

Pursuant to SB 602 enacted into law in 2010 and SB 303 in 2011, Health and Safety Code 113790 et seq., (“California Food Handler Card Law”), food handlers, as defined, will be required to obtain a food handler card after taking a food safety training course and passing an assessment. This document was compiled by a stakeholder working group comprised of members of the California Retail Food Safety Coalition (CRFSC), the California Conference of Directors of Environmental Health (CCDEH), the California Restaurant Association (CRA) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). To view the Food Handler Card Law, visit: Senate Bill 303 or go to http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen_sb_0301-0350/sb_303_bill_20110906_chaptered.

1. **Baselines** – Dirt Swept and Blown off Infield Grass, Holes Filled in with Rake, roll w/ Roller, Finishing Rake Over Top of Baseline

2. **Infield** – Bases Removed, Dirt Swept off Infield Grass, Field Dragged (best done in circles), Finishing Rake Next to Infield Grass, Field Watered (Note: Field will probably need to be spike dragged at least once during the summer. Done with car.) Also, might need to roll parts of the infield that get the most wear (ex. rounding first and sliding area at second).

3. **Home plate** – Wet Dirt, Rake Dirt in Towards Plate, Use Tamp in Batter’s Boxes and Catcher’s Holes, Finishing Rake, Roll Entire Area Every Other Week

4. **Pitcher’s Mound** – Sweep All Dirt Off Grass Back onto Mound, Wet Dirt, Rake Dirt Up Towards Rubber, Move Dirt Over Holes (Pivot and Landing Area), Tamp Dirt, Finishing Rake

5. **Infield Grass** – Water, Mow once a week, Mow in Different Directions each time you mow (Home to 1st, then Home to 3rd), Field will need to be fertilized at least once, if not twice this summer.

**Board Policy Manual**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Printed: 01/10/2024 11:55 AM**  
**Status: ADOPTED**  

**Policy 1330: Use Of School Facilities**  
**Original Adopted Date: 05/08/2018 | Last Reviewed Date: 05/08/2018**  

The Governing Board recognizes that district facilities and grounds are a community resource to be used primarily for school programs and activities. The board authorizes the use of school facilities and grounds by community groups for purposes provided for in the Civic Center Act (Education code section 38130 et seq.) when such use does not interfere with school activities.

The board hereby authorizes the superintendent or designee to approve or deny requests for the use of district facilities and grounds according to regulations consistent with law and this policy. The superintendent or designee is further authorized to develop and maintain all necessary regulations, rules, and procedures regarding the use of district-owned facilities and grounds in order to:

1. Aid, encourage and assist groups desiring to use school facilities and grounds for approved activities.

2. Preserve order in school buildings and on school grounds, and protect school facilities and grounds.

(cf. 3517 - Emergencies and Disaster Preparedness Plan)

3. Ensure that the use of facilities and grounds is consistent with the use of the facilities and grounds for school purposes and does not interfere with the regular conduct of school work.

4. If necessary, a district employee may be designated by the superintendent to supervise these tasks.

**Permitted Uses of District Facilities**  

The board directs the superintendent or designee to make district facilities and grounds under its jurisdiction available as a civic center to citizens and community groups for the following purposes, subject to district policies and regulations:

1. Public, literary, scientific, recreational, educational, or public agency meetings.

2. The discussion of matters of general or public interest.

3. The conduct of religious services.

4. Child care programs to provide supervision and activities for children of preschool and elementary school age.

5. The administration of examinations for the selection of personnel or the instruction of precinct board members by public agencies.

6. Supervised recreational activities, including but not limited to, sports league activities that are arranged for and supervised by entities including religious organizations or churches, and in which youths may participate regardless of religious belief or denomination.

7. A community youth center.

8. Mass care and welfare shelters during disasters or other emergencies affecting the public health and welfare.

9. A ceremony, patriotic celebration, or related educational assembly conducted by a veterans' organization.

10. Other purposes deemed appropriate by the board.

In accordance with Education Code sections 38131(b)(3), and 38134(d), the district must charge at least direct costs for "the conduct of religious services for temporary periods, on a one-time or renewable basis, by any church or religious organization that has no suitable meeting place for the conduct of the services."

The superintendent or designee may exclude certain school facilities and grounds from non-school use for safety or security reasons.

**Restrictions**  
<!-- Page 131 -->
![Attachment C](https://via.placeholder.com/768x971.png?text=Attachment+C)

District facilities and grounds shall not be used for any of the following activities:

1. Any use for the commission of any crime or any act prohibited by any federal, state, or local laws, including those laws prohibiting discrimination.

2. Any use which is inconsistent with their use for school purposes or which interferes with the regular conduct of school or school work.

3. Any use which involves the possession, consumption, or sale of alcoholic beverages or any restricted substances on district property.

**Priority for District or School Programs**

All district and school-related activities (clubs, cocurricular, extracurricular, and class events, etc.) shall be given first priority in the use of district facilities and grounds. Thereafter, the use of facilities and grounds shall be in the order of priority as set forth in Administrative Regulation ("AR") 1330.

**Fees**

The board authorizes the use of district facilities or grounds for events on Monday through Friday (excluding holidays) without charge to school-related or District-related organizations, associations, clubs, or other groups whose activities are directly related to, or for the benefit of, district schools or students, and to certain other groups as described in AR 1330.

Other organizations or groups requesting the use of school facilities under the Civic Center Act or district-related groups seeking use of facilities or grounds on Saturday, Sunday or holidays shall be charged at least direct costs.

In determining the direct costs to be charged to a group or organization for use of each, or each type of district school facility or grounds, the superintendent or designee shall calculate, in accordance with California Code of Regulations, Title 5 (5 C.C.R.), sections 14037-14041, the user's proportionate share of the following costs:

1. **Capital direct costs**, including the estimated costs of maintenance, repair, restoration, and refurbishment of school facilities or grounds. For the purposes of the determining a group or organization's proportional share of the costs for maintenance, repair, restoration and refurbishment, a "school facility" is limited to non-classroom space, such as multi-purpose rooms and indoor basketball courts, and "school grounds" include, but are not limited to, playing fields, athletic fields, track and field venues, tennis courts and outdoor basketball courts.

   Capital direct costs shall not be charged to organizations retained by the district or school to provide instruction or instructional activities to students during school hours or for classroom-based programs that operate after school hours, including, but not limited to, after-school, tutoring, and child care programs.

2. **Operational direct costs**, including the estimated costs of supplies, utilities, janitorial services, other services of district employees and/or contracted workers, and salaries and benefits paid to district employees directly associated with the administration of the Civic Center Act to operate and maintain school facilities and grounds.

Organizations or groups shall be charged fair rental value when using school facilities and grounds for entertainment or meetings where admission is charged or contributions solicited and net receipts are not to be expended for charitable purposes or for the welfare of the district's students.

"Fair rental value" means direct costs, as defined above, plus the amortized costs of the school facilities and grounds used for the activity or event.

In accordance with the provisions of 5 C.C.R. 14037-14041, the board shall adopt a comprehensive schedule of fees to be charged to groups and organizations for the use of school facilities and grounds, including, but not limited to non-classroom space, multipurpose rooms, playing or athletic fields, track and field venues, tennis courts, and basketball courts.

**Policy Reference Disclaimer:** These references are not intended to be part of the policy itself, nor do they indicate the basis or authority for the board to enact this policy. Instead, they are provided as additional resources for those interested in the subject matter of the policy.

# M E M O R A N D U M

By E-Mail: frank.camarada@sanjuan.edu

**DATE:** January 25, 2024  
**TO:** Frank Camarda  
Chief Operations Officer  
San Juan Unified School District  
**FROM:** Megan Macy  
Junaid Halani  
**RE:** Opening District Facilities to the Public  

This memorandum evaluates the risks to the San Juan Unified School District (“District”) in opening all District tracks, fields, and play spaces to the general public. A part of that evaluation is an examination of the Civic Center Act, Board policies, District processes, and insurance requirements, all of which provide the framework for the public’s use of District facilities. Below is a summary of the risks involved and an overview of the various legal and policy considerations in enacting such a District-wide program.

## Executive Summary

The Civic Center Act provides a statutory framework for the public’s use of District facilities and how they may be regulated. The District’s Facility Use Handbook and adopted Board Policies enact the regulations included in the Civic Center Act and provide a robust set of procedures and fees for the use of District facilities. Allowing the public to use District facilities outside of these formal avenues exposes the District to the risk of non-compliance with the law, District policies and procedures, and liability for injury and damage. Some of these risks are as follows:

- The Civic Center Act requires the District to charge certain entities for use of District facilities and opening all facilities up to all members of the public would make enforcing this requirement extremely difficult.
- The logistics of an “open campus” model may lead to scenarios where entities that should be paying to use District facilities are not doing so, which would further expose the District to risk.
<!-- Page 136 -->
- The open campus model is likely to create an intense demand on District staff and resources to manage those facilities’ use, maintenance, and safety without offsetting means to pay for the wear and tear. Specifically, such use may result in property damage, depreciation of District assets, and increased costs to account for the increased staff need to oversee the use of District facilities.
- Allowing all members of the public to use all District facilities without oversight does not alleviate the District’s legal duty of care to individuals on District property. Therefore, the District would remain liable for any damages, injuries, and unforeseen conditions present on District property. This is a large source of undefined risk that may or may not be covered by the District’s insurance policies. Even if covered by insurance, it only takes a few litigious members of the public to create a significant cost burden for the District to defend itself against complaints and lawsuits stemming from the public use of District facilities.
- Uncontrolled use of District facilities creates a potential risk to District students, to the extent students are on District premises for school related events after school hours.

For these reasons, the risks of an open campus approach are significant, while the added benefit to the community at large is minimal, the public can already use District facilities under the Civic Center Act. The District currently has a comprehensive facility use policy that strikes a balance between allowing members of the public to use District facilities while also mitigating the risk of such use to the District and ensuring the safety of District students. We recommend continuing this practice. Below we provide our analysis of the statutes and regulations at play.

**Legal Background**

**A. Purpose of the Civic Center Act**  
Public schools are funded through taxpayer monies. Thus, in California, the facilities of a public school are considered a part of the community, and since 1917, state law has required that schools make facilities available for public use. The purpose of the Civic Center Act (“Act”) (Ed. Code § 38130, et seq.) is to allow community groups to use public school facilities when those facilities are not utilized for school activities (e.g., after school and on weekends). The Act also permits school districts to charge fees to those community groups requesting the use of public-school facilities.

**B. Use of School Facilities or Grounds under the Act**  
The Act states that there is a civic center at each and every public-school facility and public school grounds where citizens, parents, and other groups may engage in recreational activities and may meet in order to discuss “any subjects and questions that in their judgment pertain to the educational, political, economic, artistic, and moral interests of the citizens of the communities in which they reside.” (Ed. Code, § 38131, subd. (a).) These “other groups” include “
<!-- Page 137 -->
The Act further provides specific instances in which the use of school facilities and grounds are discretionary (a school district may allow the requested use) and mandatory (a school district must allow the requested use). A school district may authorize the use of school facilities when used for:

- public, literary, scientific, recreational, educational, or public agency meetings;
- the discussion of matters of general or public interest;
- the conduct of religious services for temporary periods on a one-time or renewable basis, by any church or religious organization that has no suitable meeting place for the conduct of such services;
- the administration of exams for personnel selection or instruction of precinct board members by public agencies;
- child care of any day care programs;
- supervised recreational activities (e.g., youth sports);
- a community youth center;
- ceremonies and patriotic celebrations; and
- any other purpose deemed appropriate by the district’s governing board.

(Ed. Code, § 38131, subd. (b).) A school district must authorize the use of any school facilities to “nonprofit organizations” or to a “club or an association organized to promote youth and school activities.” (Ed. Code, § 38134, subd. (a)(1).) These groups include, but are not limited to, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Camp Fire USA, the YMCA, parent-teacher associations, and school-community advisory councils. (Ed. Code, § 38134, subd. (a)(1).) However, a school district is not required to allow the use of public-school facilities if the district’s governing board determines that the use is for fundraising activities that are not beneficial to youth or public-school activities of the district. (Ed. Code, § 38134, subd. (a)(2).)

Education Code section 38133(b) says: “The management, direction, and control of school facilities under this article are vested in the governing board of the school district, which shall promulgate all rules and regulations necessary to provide, at a minimum, for the following: … (b) Preservation of order in school facilities and on school grounds, and protection of school facilities and school grounds …” Furthermore, the Supreme Court has said, in Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier (1987) 484 U.S. 260, 267, that “. . . The public

C. Assessing Fees for Use of School Facilities or Grounds

In addition to establishing when public school facilities and grounds may be used, the Civic Center Act (Ed. Code, § 38130 et seq.) also provides when a school district may, or must, assess fees for the use of the school facilities or grounds. These fees and the types that may be assessed are dependent on the purpose for which the facilities or grounds are used, and by whom they are used.

There are two types of fees that may be imposed on users of District facilities under the Civic Center Act: direct costs and fair rental value.

Districts may charge “direct costs” for the use of school facilities by nonprofit organizations and clubs, or associations organized to promote youth and school activities, including, but not limited to, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Camp Fire, Inc., parent-teachers’ associations, school-community advisory councils, and religious organizations or churches that arrange for and supervise sports league activities for youths. (Ed. Code, § 38134(b)-(c).) Essentially, a school district has the discretion to assess fees for uses that are beneficial to youth or public-school activities of the district.

It is important to note, however, that the school district may not charge a fee that exceeds the district’s own direct costs and, before the school district may impose such fees, the district must adopt a policy specifying which activities will be assessed fees. In addition, when electing to charge fees pursuant to the Civic Center Act, a school district governing board must adopt a fee schedule that includes the hourly fee for each specific facility and grounds or “like” facilities and grounds, such as all classrooms or all multipurpose rooms.) (5 CCR §14041.)

A school district must assess fees in an amount at least equal to the district’s direct costs if a church or religious denomination uses the facility to conduct religious services for a temporary period on a one-time or renewable basis. (Ed. Code, § 38134(d).)

With regard to for-profit use of school facilities under the Civic Center Act, Education Code section 38134(e) states that “in the case of entertainment or a meeting where an admission fee is charged, or contributions are solicited, and the net receipts are not expended for the welfare of the pupils of the school district or for charitable purposes, a charge equal to fair rental value shall be levied for the use of the school facilities or grounds.” [Emphasis added.] Fair rental value is defined as “the direct costs to the school district plus the amortized costs of the school facilities or grounds used for the duration of the activity authorized.” (Ed. Code §38134(g)(2).)

Thus, there is a difference in language with regard to the two types of charges. Direct costs “may” be charged, while fair rental value “shall” be levied in certain circumstances.

Legal Analysis

A. The District’s Facility Use Handbook

<!-- Page 139 -->
![Attachment D](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+D)

To comply with the Act, the District’s Board has adopted Board Policy (“BP”) 1330 (Use of District Facilities and Grounds). A key provision in BP 1330 provides that “All district and school-related activities...shall be given first priority in the use of district facilities and grounds.” The Board also annually adopts a Facility Use Handbook (“Handbook”) that incorporates the Act’s requirements and sets forth a comprehensive fee schedule and framework for outside entities that want to use District facilities.

The Handbook provides a comprehensive breakdown of the type of facilities available for public use, the process by which the public may request the use of the facilities, insurance requirements, guidelines for the use of facilities, a complaint process, maintenance forms, a process to check out equipment, and a schedule of fees. (Handbook p 8-17.) This allows District staff to keep track of who is using the facilities to ensure that they are paying the appropriate fees and that their use of the facilities does not conflict with District events and use of the facilities (Handbook p 7-9.) Managing and maintaining the smooth operation of District facilities is an exercise in logistics, and the ability to control access to and use of facilities is key in ensuring that facilities are not overrun, that public use does not conflict with District use, and that members of the public that damage District facilities are held responsible and restricted from endangering District property.

In a way, District facilities are already open to the public for use, with the caveat that access is controlled so that such use is managed responsibly for the benefit of all. Expanding public use so that members of the public may use District facilities without any process would significantly increase the workload on District staff and resources to ensure that District facilities remain suitable and safe for use. Staff would need to invent a whole new set of policies and procedures to ensure the safety of the public and District students under this new regime. For instance, if public facilities are open to the general public, homeless and transient members may take advantage of the space and insist on camping out on District property. District staff would then need to spend time and resources to resolve the situation in a safe manner. Under current policies, the probability of such situations arising is limited by the limited nature of access to District facilities. In addition, if members of the public were to damage District property, it would take some time for the District to identify the issue, and there would be no way for the District to track down who may be responsible for the damage. All the while, the damaged property would present a further source of injury to the public and in turn liability to the District.

The Handbook also sets out a complex fee structure that is broken down by the type of entity requesting access to District property and the reason for the access. For example, theater rentals and aquatic center rentals are priced differently, and those prices are further modified by whether the event is considered a “Community Event” or a “Fair Market Event.” (Handbook p. 5-7 and 14.) These price differences are based on complex cost calculations mandated in part by the Act. As explained above, there are instances where the District may charge fees and instances where the District must not charge fees. If the District were to open all facilities to the public without any access control, then it becomes increasingly difficult for staff to appropriately charge for the use of District facilities. In particular, in scenarios where the District must charge for facilities, not doing so would put the District in a state of non-compliance with statute and at risk of challenge by an aggrieved member of the public.

For example, an entity that currently enjoys consistent use of District facilities but can no longer do so because of the high demand and easy access under the new policy may decide that it is

**B. Insurance and Liability for Injury**  
1. **Liability Under the Civic Center Act**  
The Act allocates the risk of injury between a school district and certain groups using school facilities. A school district authorizing the use of school facilities by nonprofit organizations and groups promoting youth and school activities is liable for an injury resulting from the negligence of the school district in the ownership and maintenance of the school facilities or grounds. (Ed. Code, § 38134, subd. (i).) A group using school facilities or grounds under the Act is liable for an injury resulting from the negligence of that group during the use of the school facilities or grounds. (Id.) Moreover, the school district and the group using the school facilities or grounds under this section shall each bear the cost of insuring against its respective risks and shall each bear the costs of defending itself against claims arising from those risks. (Id.)  
2. **Liability During After Hours Use**  
The District may be subject to general tort liability unrelated to the use of its facilities under the Act. (Gov. Code, § 815.2, subd. (a), 815.6.) As you may know, tort law describes the non-criminal rules against one person (or entity) engaging in harmful acts toward another person. For example, the law of negligence establishes a minimum set of expectations (called a “standard of care”) for each person with others. (Civil Code § 1714(a).) The ordinary standard of care describes what a “reasonable person” would do in the defendant’s shoes, but a higher standard of care is applied when there is a special relationship between the parties (e.g., teacher/student, counselor/patient). (Guerrero v. South Bay Union Sch. Dist. (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 264, 268, citations omitted.) A defendant’s intentions are not relevant to prove a negligence claim. A plaintiff can prevail if he / she proves that the defendant acted below the standard of care and the acts caused the plaintiff damages. Generally, schools may be subject to claims of negligent supervision, negligent hiring, and/or negligent maintenance of school grounds. (Gov. Code, § 835.)  
For a negligence claim, including premises liability (e.g., slip and fall cases), the plaintiff must prove the defendant had a duty of care that was breached, and the breach caused plaintiff to suffer damages. For schools, the duty of care to maintain school grounds may be similar to the standard it maintains for its students during normal school hours.  
For example, a school may be liable if it has a practice of illuminating the basketball courts at night to allow community use, then inadvertently sets the timers to turn off the lights at night while the community uses the courts. Of note, each liability analysis is fact-determinative, and the aforementioned example is only intended to illustrate possible exposure.  
Because the Act only addresses potential liability for use by particular organizations and illustrates the fact that a school district still remains potentially liable for injury from community use.

use, we defer to the District’s insurance provider to evaluate the liability and insurance coverage issues associated with use of school facilities or grounds by any group. We understand that SIA is in the process of putting this together.

**Conclusion**

Modifying District policy to provide for an open campus model increases the risks and liabilities to the District. One way to mitigate these risks is to create and implement policies and procedures that control access and use of facilities. Such policies and procedures already exist in the form of the Handbook and the District’s permitting system. That is to say, District facilities are currently accessible to members of the public, such use is simply managed to ensure the facilities are properly maintained, and that public use does not endanger District staff or students. The District’s approach in this regard is standard practice amongst many large school districts in the state. Generally, school districts do not allow unrestricted access to facilities due to the potential risk to District students and the District itself. Please let us know if you have any questions on any of the items in this memorandum.

**April 2020**  
Historically, the San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD) allowed non-permitted community use of its campuses, specifically the high school fields, for various activities such as running, walking, informal soccer games, and football. However, concerns about student safety prompted the school district to install fences around the school grounds to protect students during school hours. Although the fields were reserved only for school activities and permitted events, many people in the community continued to use them as before, unaware of the new policy.

On April 7, 2020, in response to Sacramento County’s updated Covid 19 Stay-at-Home order that closed outdoor public recreational spaces, SJUSD closed their campuses, including high school track and fields, for recreation, group activities and team practices until the Stay-at-Home Order was lifted. A sign was posted on school campuses notifying the community of the new order.

**February 2023**  
On February 14, 2023, the SJUSD Board of Trustees reached a consensus to instruct the Facilities Committee to research and provide policy recommendations on the reopening of outdoor school recreational facilities for non-permitted use by the community during non-school hours and present their findings and recommendations to the School Board.

**March 2023**  
During the March Facilities Committee meeting, Saul Hernandez, who serves as the Board liaison to the Facilities Committee, presented the School Board's request to the committee. As a result, an ad hoc committee was established to research and provide recommendations on reopening outdoor school recreational resources for non-permitted community use outside of school hours. However, following a request from Frank Camarda, the Chief Operations Officer of SJUSD, the committee agreed to narrow its focus to reopening only the high school track and fields.

**April 2023**  
At the April ad hoc committee meeting, Cherie Chenoweth, SJUSD Facilities Coordinator, was asked to provide answers to the following questions:

1. **How far away are other public parks/sports fields from SJUSD high schools within a 1-mile radius?** I am not sure if we have a map of this, we do have a list of what schools fall in what park district.

2. **Do we have current park/district partnerships?** – Yes we have Joint Use Agreements with all park districts within our district boundaries.

3. **What is the incident data within the past 5 years at SJUSD high schools?** If you have data on the types of incidents (e.g. vandalism, assault) that occur outside school hours by non-students, that would be especially helpful. This information would be with Risk Management and M&O through the work order system. Some of this might also come from Safe Schools too.
<!-- Page 143 -->
4. What is the facility budget to repair damage? M&O gets 3% of the overall general fund expenses in the fiscal year, this pays for all employees and maintenance around the district. Damage claims go through Risk Management.

5. Additionally, how much has it cost to repair criminal damage to high schools that occur outside school hours? This would not be information I would have but if there was a claim Risk Management and M&O’s workorder system would have this.

6. What would the estimated cost be to hire someone to open and close campus gates on weekends? This would depend on who the person is. I believe the this would fall under a custodian; they have a contract that if they are required to come in they are paid a minimum of 3 hours. The average cost would be $174.00.

Risk Management  
On April 19, 2023, Lupita Alcala, an ad hoc committee member, spoke with Michelle Fischer, Manager of Risk Management at SJUSD, about the potential liability and risk of opening high school track and fields to the community during non-school hours. Ms. Fischer provided the following comments:

Risks: Vandalism, cleanliness (dogs), altercations, potential field closure and loss of revenue due to vandalism, lack of oversight, cost for custodian, risk of being sued if something happened, community members having a false sense of security, community members unwilling to leave fields if asked, and athletic directors being accustomed to full access to fields. Although risk contributions would not automatically go up, they could go up if there was an incident where negligence was a factor.

Following the meeting, Ms. Fischer checked with both Folsom-Cordova and Sac City and neither district allows non-permitted community use of their HS track and fields. She stated that continuing to lock HS track and fields was strongly suggested by their liability pool as losses could have the potential of impacting the JPA as well as the district’s budget since each has a deductible of $5K.

Benefits: Acknowledged that the community pays for the track and fields through vaRious voter-approved bond measures, and that open fields would allow the community to get more exercise.

Potential Impact on SJUSD Insurance Pool Member Contribution Rates:
- There has been one claim filed for vandalism: $3000 for damage to the tennis courts (cost for repair fell under the $5000 deductible). Incident occurred in 2019 during the early morning hours.
- In answer to the question regarding any increase to the District’s insurance pool member contribution rates should the HS tracks be kept open for community use, our contribution would only increase if there are submitted claims. There are two categories of claims that could potentially increase as a result of opening up HS tracks: (1) Property claims (damage to our property) and (2) Liability claims (damage to individuals or their property).
- Property claims that fall under the $5K deductible would not hit the pool, and would not impact our annual property contribution to the pool. Nevertheless, the fiscal impact on the
<!-- Page 144 -->
![Attachment E](attachment_e.png)

District’s budget remains as the District would be paying for the claim up to the first $5K. If the claim exceeds the deductible, the District is required to pay a higher property contribution as a result of that experience.
- Liability claims, like property claims, can impact our experience resulting in higher contributions for our liability insurance. Starting this year, a $5K deductible has been applied to submitted liability claims. If a liability claim is accepted that resulted in a loss for the pool, the District is billed $5K for that event (over and above the annual contribution) - if that claim was due to the gross negligence of the District.
- In summary, the District will be fiscally liable for property and liability claims where (1) the insurance pool does not believe the existing policy holds coverage for the allegation and/or (2) where the deductible exceeds.

**May 2023**  
During the meeting in May, the ad hoc committee worked on creating two surveys - an Athletic Director Survey and a Community Survey for distribution throughout the summer and fall.

**June 2023**  
Throughout the summer, the ad hoc committee fine-tuned surveys and monitored non-permitted community use of the track and fields in their neighborhoods.

**July/August 2023**  
July 26, 2023 - August 28, 2023: A survey was distributed online to assess community support for non-permitted use of high school track and fields during non-school hours. The survey was shared on various platforms including parent pages, community outreach, and word-of-mouth advertising to engage parents, school staff, students, and community members from all corners of the district.

**Community Survey Results**  
**Questions:**
1. Do you support keeping high school track and fields open for community use during non-school hours?

NO - Reasons cited: vandalism, increased cost to maintain fields, and potential damage to sports equipment.

YES - Reasons cited:
- **Safety** – Schools are perceived as safe and welcoming. A community presence during non-school hours increases safety, fosters a sense of belonging, and reduces vandalism.
- **Exercise/Socialization** – Physical activities such as running, walking, and soccer are beneficial for both physical and mental health, and the safe environment of the school is an important factor that encourages families and friends to come out and exercise when they otherwise would not.
- **Bond Measures** – Fields are paid for by the community and they should be able to use them when schools are not in session. Fields were open until 2020, closed due to Covid, and never reopened.

**September 2023**
September 13, 2023: Melinda Avey, ad hoc committee chair, met with Mr. Camarda, to review progress and arrange for meetings with school administrators and athletic directors. Mr. Camarda shared a checklist he had developed for the committee to ensure due diligence.

**October 2023**
October 30, 2023: Ms. Avey held a meeting via Zoom with principals and athletic directors from Rio Americano, Bella Vista, El Camino, and Del Campo High Schools. The meeting was organized by Mr. Camarda to give principals and athletic directors an opportunity to share their opinions and concerns regarding reopening the track and fields for non-permitted community use during non-school hours.
- The group did not support the idea of opening the fields for non-permitted community use. They were mostly concerned about vandalism, turf damage, shortened lifespan of the fields, trash, liability, and the workload of the custodial staff. There were complaints that people were accessing the fields by climbing over fences and propping open the gates.
- It was not clear whether locking the fields had reduced damage or decreased unauthorized use.
- Additionally, it was unclear whether the damage cited was being caused solely by people using the track and fields during daylight hours in the evening or on weekends, or by people coming onto campus at night – or both.
- There were no complaints from coaches that community members have interrupted practices or other organized activities.

**November 2023**
November 1, 2023: A survey was distributed to SJUSD High School Principals and Athletic Directors. Casa Robles, Encina, Mira Loma, and El Camino responded to the survey. Mesa Verde and San Juan did not participate in the Zoom call or respond to the survey.

**Principal/Athletic Director Survey Results**
How often have you observed unauthorized use of the track and fields at your school by the local community?
- Casa - We have had very minimal unauthorized use the past couple of years.
- Encina - Pretty much every day.
- Mira Loma - Several times a week.
- El Camino - Occasionally on Sundays or on school breaks.
<!-- Page 146 -->
![Attachment E](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+E)

What changes to unauthorized use have you observed after the track and fields became secured by locked fencing?  
Casa - This has definitely been a deterrent from unauthorized use.  
Encina - No change, they find a way onto our facilities. It is easy to jump a fence.  
Mira Loma - People either climb over the fence or there is a small gap in the fence between our baseball field and all weather track and people are able to get in through the gap in the fence.  
El Camino - People would jump the fence  

What changes in wear and tear and/or vandalism have you observed since the track and fields became secured by locked fencing?  
Casa - Fortunately we have had minimal wear and tear or vandalism to our stadium field and track. Occasionally we have wear and tear on our baseball and softball fields due to unauthorized use however those facilities are not able to be locked.  
Encina - No change.  
Mira Loma - We find dog poop, gum, and trash on the track and all weather field from community use.  
El Camino - Lots of wear and tear on the turf. Spots that need to be replaced. Some trash left over the weekend, and damage to our soccer goal nets.  

If track and fields were to remain open for non-permitted community use during non-school daylight hours when other activities are not scheduled, what conditions would you want in place to ensure the safe use of the track and fields?  
Casa - I would prefer our facilities were not open during non school hours or after daylight. I believe this will open up our facilities for vandalism and unauthorized use which in return will put unwanted staff hours on cleaning or repairs.  
Encina - Trash cans and posting signs. Signs should detail what the expectations are, No smoking, clean up after yourselves, do not mess with locks (we have found that people jam the lock so that others can get in without jumping the fences).  
Mira Loma - I would want groups to have to sign up to use the facilities so they were responsible for the safe use of the track and fields.  
El Camino - I would like to see replacement of damaged equipment by the district.  

Please share any other comments you may have?  
Casa - Please keep our facilities secured. Thank you  
Encina - We have had to clean up after the community, damage to the field, cigarette butts, damaged locks and fences.  
Mira Loma - I am concerned about potential vandalism and property damage if the facilities are left open to the public.  
El Camino – No response.  

January 2024  
January 10, 2024: Ms. Avey and Ms. Alcala had a meeting with Mr. Camarda to discuss the progress of the ad hoc committee and gather information about the damage caused to the high school tracks and fields due to non-permitted community use outside of school hours.  
- Mr. Camarda reported that no incidents had been reported to M&O.  
- Mr. Camarda shared that school buildings are more likely to be targeted for vandalism and other criminal activities than the high school tracks and fields.

<!-- Page 147 -->
- Fields reflect normal wear and tear, and regular maintenance and replacement are on schedule.
- In rare cases, an outside athletic storage facility might be broken into or vandalized.
- If policy were to be changed, the Facilities Use Handbook would need to be revised.

**January 15, 2024:** Ms. Avey met with the American River Futbol Club (ARFC), a youth soccer club. The club's President, Troy Topping, informed her that they do not face any problems with community members disrupting their permitted activities. Any issues that arise are usually with other teams. Mr. Topping also felt that the community should have access to the fields during non-school hours when they are not being used for sanctioned activities.

**February 2024**  
**February 2, 2024:** Site visit to Del Campo, El Camino, and Bella Vista with Ms. Avey, Mr. Camarda, Mr. Walker M&O, and school custodians to discuss impact of non-permitted community use of HS tracks and fields during non-school hours. Findings include:
- All three custodians opposed opening track and fields, generally citing concerns about increased traffic on the fields, increased damage to the fields and increased staff workload.
- It is not documented by staff when, how many and how frequently community members use the track and fields.
- Damage and incidents of vandalism are not documented by custodians or M&O.
- When asked to give examples of vandalism to the track and fields, most of their responses pertained to vandalism to the school buildings and other areas on the campus. However, there was a recent incident at Bella Vista High School where a group of individuals damaged the press box by jumping on the roof until it collapsed. All cited fireworks (July 4th, New Years Eve) but it was not clear if those incidents happened on the track and fields or in other parts of the school campuses. Occasionally, there are needles or broken glass found on the fields or in the stands. There is no evidence to indicate that the vandalism is caused by community members using the fields. These events likely happen at night or when no one else is around.
- Due to the amount of trash present, however, it is unclear whether the increase in trash is a result of the weekend's high school athletic events and other permitted activities, or if it is due to community members who typically use the fields on Sundays when there are no other events.
- Gates are routinely left open during non-school hours, including overnight – sometimes custodians forget to lock the gates, sometimes coaches leave them open, and sometimes people climb the fence and prop the gates open.
- There is no noticeable difference in the number of people using the fields or the amount of cleanup required whether the gates are left open or closed.
- There have been a handful of divots requiring repair over the past 5 years. It is not known who caused the divots and is felt that they are likely the result of normal wear and tear.
- A limited number of incidents related to homelessness were resolved without incident.
- Dogs are a problem at all the schools regardless of whether gates are left open or not.
- Staff oppose opening fields to the community during non-school hours.

**Other Outreach and Findings**  
During the year, members of the ad hoc committee visited several fields and spoke with people present there. We learned that sometimes the gates had been left open, but if the gates were locked, someone would climb the fence and open the gate for others to enter.
<!-- Page 148 -->
![Attachment E](attachment_e.png)

Many of those we met were small groups of high school and middle school students or young adults playing pick-up soccer or flag football. They preferred the turf field, liked getting together with friends, and felt safer there than at adjacent parks where there were issues with drug use and crime. When asked what they would be doing if they weren’t out on the field with their friends, they answered that they would likely be home alone gaming on their computers.

Additionally, there were many adults walking or running on the track as well as parents with young children who were doing the same. They preferred the high school setting over other options and felt comfortable there. They appreciated the absence of traffic and felt safe with others on the track.

We talked to neighbors and other community members and found widespread support for opening track and fields for non-permitted community use during non-school hours. Their reasons mirrored the responses given by those who responded to the community survey.

**Folsom-Cordova Unified School District (FCUSD)**  
Although SJUSD Risk Management was correct in that Folsom-Cordova USD does not permit community access to high school stadiums, they do allow and even encourage non-permitted community use of their other outdoor recreational resources. The gates to those areas are unlocked during non-school hours to allow public access. A sign is posted stating that the outdoor recreational areas at the facility are accessible to the public during non-school hours. However, FCUSD reserves the right to lock the gates without prior notice in accordance with Board Policy 1000.

**American River College (ARC)**  
The ARC college track and fields are open to the community from early morning until dusk. Committee chair (Ms. Avey) spoke with a coach who confirmed that the ARC fields are not vandalized or otherwise abused by the community. In fact, he thinks that non-permitted community use is a protective factor since there is usually someone on the field, which probably deters vandalism. Although ARC is located next to a creek known to house homeless encampments, they have no issues with homeless individuals except for occasional use of Port-A-Potties.

The coach was surprised to learn that Bella Vista was closed during non-school hours because he remembers that the community was promised that they would never lose access to the fields if they agreed to permit lights on the fields.

Further research by the ad hoc committee revealed that during the late 1990s, Bella Vista High School initiated a significant undertaking to upgrade its outdoor facilities, which became known as the "Field of Dreams". The project, which was featured in the December 2001 edition of "Athletic Business", was a collaborative effort between parents, private businesses, local non-profits, and government entities to construct an outdoor sports and recreational area that could be utilized by the entire community.

One of the top priorities was to install lights at Bronco Stadium. To achieve this, a deal was made with a local cellular-communications equipment provider who agreed to pay $600,000 for four new light poles for the BV football field, on the condition that they could use the light poles for their cell towers.

"In return, the tower company was given full community support for the project, which doesn't always happen when you want to build a cell tower in someone's neighborhood," said Larry Masuoka who was the chair of the Fair Oaks Park and Recreation District at the time.

**RECOMMENDATION – Approved by SJUSD Facilities Committee 02/06/2024**  
SJUSD high school track and fields shall be available to the public for non-permitted use during non-school hours, except when the track and fields are being used for high school activities or other permitted events. The track and fields may be closed without notice if the High School Principal and Deputy Superintendent of Schools determine that there are documented incidents of vandalism that necessitate locking the gates during non-school hours.

# Academic Focus Areas

While each school is unique, we are committed to providing a high-quality education for every student that includes:

- A challenging, standards-based academic program at every school
- Additional supports for students who require extra assistance
- Enrichment opportunities and programs

Welcoming schools that support the social and emotional needs of our students form the foundation for academic excellence. We recognize this is built through continuous improvement of intentional collaborative efforts that are focused on the following:

1. **Connected School Communities:** Caring staff actively build community relationships, identify assets and needs and connect students and families with resources to help them access the best opportunities our schools have to offer.
2. **Healthy Environments for Social-Emotional Growth:** Staff will cultivate inclusive, safe, equitable, and culturally responsive and healthy environments by integration of social and emotional learning to ensure essential student development.
3. **Engaging Academic Programs:** Staff educators will engage and support each student in a challenging and broad course of study that builds skills, knowledge and experiences preparing all to be critical thinkers who communicate effectively, collaborate and are civic-minded.
4. **Clear Pathways to Bright Futures:** Our whole school community engages each student in discovering their limitless potential, and through coordinated efforts, prepares them for college, career and bright futures filled with opportunities.

# District Overview

Created in 1960 with the merger of six school districts, San Juan Unified School District has a rich tradition in providing all students with the opportunity for academic success and achievement.

The district serves a 75-square-mile area covering the communities of Arden-Arcade, Carmichael, Citrus Heights, Fair Oaks, Gold River and Orangevale.

Today, San Juan Unified is the 10th largest school district in California with an expenditure budget of more than $500 million used to employ more than 5,000 individuals and to educate more than 45,000 students in our early learning, TK-12 and adult programs. More than 10,000 additional K-12 students are served in independent charter schools within the district.

The district consists of 33 elementary schools, eight K-8 schools, nine middle schools, nine comprehensive high schools, three special-education centers, three alternative schools, one adult-education center, two Early Childhood Education centers and one dependent charter.

The student population is diverse. During the 2021-2022-2022-2023 school year, the district’s ethnic/racial makeup was: 0.5-6 percent American Indian or Alaskan Native, 25.9-7 percent Hispanic/Latino, 7.16.9 percent African American, 47.647 percent White, 9.810.6 percent Asian/Asian American, 0.7 percent Pacific Islander, 9 percent Filipino and 7.4.6 percent multi-race.

# Roles and responsibilities of board members and the superintendent

## Board Roles

The role of the board is to provide each student with an education of the highest possible quality within the limits of financial support provided by the State of California. To accomplish this, board members are responsible for five roles identified by the California School Boards Association (CSBA):

- **Setting the direction** for the district by involving parents/guardians, community, students and staff, while focusing on student learning and achievement.

- **Establishing an effective and efficient structure** by employing the superintendent, developing and adopting policies, establishing academic expectations and adopting curriculum and instructional materials, establishing budget priorities and adopting the budget, providing safe and adequate facilities to support student learning, and setting parameters for negotiations with employee organizations and ratifying collective bargaining agreements.

- **Providing support to the superintendent and staff** by following standards of responsible governance, making decisions and providing resources that support district priorities and goals, upholding board policies and being effective spokespersons by being knowledgeable about district programs and goals.

- **Ensuring accountability** through evaluation of the superintendent; monitoring and evaluating policies; serving as a judicial and appeals body; monitoring student achievement and program effectiveness; approving, monitoring and adjusting district budgets; and monitoring the collective bargaining process.

- **Providing community leadership and advocacy** on behalf of students, the district’s educational program, and public education in order to build support within the local school community and at the state and national levels.

## Superintendent Roles

CSBA identifies the following standards and roles for superintendents working with the Board of Education:

- Promotes the success of all students and supports the efforts of the board to focus on student learning and achievement.

- Values, advocates and supports public education and all stakeholders.

- Recognizes and respects the different perspectives and styles of board members, staff, students, parents and community, ensuring the diverse range of views inform board decisions.

- Acts with dignity, treats everyone with civility and respect, and understands the implications of demeanor and behavior.

- Serves as a model for the value of lifelong learning and supports the board’s continuous professional development.

- Works with the board as a “governance team” and assures collective responsibility for building a unity of purpose, common vision and positive organizational culture.

- Recognizes that the board/superintendent governance relationship is supported by the district’s management team.

- Understands the distinctions between board and staff roles; and respects the roles of the board as the representative of the community.
<!-- Page 157 -->
- Understands that the authority rests with the board as a whole, provides guidance to the board to assist in decision making, and provides leadership based on the direction of the board as a whole.
- Communicates openly with trust and integrity, including providing all board members with equal access to information, and recognizes the importance of both responsive and anticipatory communications.
- Accepts leadership responsibility and accountability for implementing the vision, goals and policies of the district.
<!-- Page 158 -->
![Board Norms](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

**Board Norms**

The governance team commits to accomplishing these standards and roles through:

- Focusing on all students
- Demonstrating respect
- Creating transparency
- Communicating openly
- Listening actively
- Keeping commitments
- Being collaborative
- Taking the time needed to govern effectively
- Encouraging everyone’s ideas and points of view
- Balancing trustee area representation vs. districtwide responsibility
- Adherence to the Brown Act

**Trustee Areas and Representation**

Board members are elected by the voters within their trustee area but serve the students, families and residents throughout the district’s 75 square mile area. As such, board members should consider the impacts of decisions on all constituents when deliberating and take action in the best interest of the district as a whole rather than their specific trustee area. Unless specific to the election or trustee boundary designation processes, information prepared by staff will not delineate data specifically by trustee areas.

To facilitate strong community connections, board members are encouraged to build relationships with the organizations and residents within their trustee area in the manner they deem most appropriate and effective. As a courtesy, board members engaged in district business with organizations in another trustee area are encouraged to inform the board secretary and the board member representing the area.

**Welcoming new members**

The board president meets with each newly elected member individually to provide a copy of the Governance Handbook, the schedule of meetings, the format for meetings and governance team operations.

The superintendent meets with each newly elected member to provide an overview of the district and to introduce cabinet members and other staff who will be communicating with the board.

District legal counsel will give newly elected members a copy of the Brown Act and inform them they must conform to its requirements immediately upon assuming office and/or at any time when the newly elected is acting on behalf of the district.

The governance team attends the swearing-in ceremony and reception for the newly elected members.

**Annual Organizational Meeting**

The annual organizational meeting will be held within the required 15-day period commencing on the second Friday in December.

At this meeting, the board shall
- Elect a clerk, vice president and president from its members.
- Establish the regular school board meeting dates and starting/ending times for the year.
<!-- Page 159 -->
- Appoint representatives to specific organizations and committees and
- Determine locations of board meetings (Board Bylaws 9320, 9140).

# Board Meetings

## Board meeting materials
Board members will be provided with agendas and copies of all related backup materials for regular meetings at least 72 hours in advance and for special meetings at least 24 hours in advance. Members are responsible to review for reviewing all materials prior to the meeting to assist with an efficient and effective deliberative process.

To provide greater access and transparency to materials, the district is adopting a digital materials management platform. Upon request to the board assistant, members will be provided with devices, training, and/or assistance to access materials.

## Placing items on board agendas
Board members may request that matters be added to meeting agendas during the future agenda discussion, which occurs during each regularly scheduled meeting. If a majority of board members share an interest in the matter, the board president and superintendent shall determine if the topic is within jurisdiction of the board and schedule the item if so. Items that are not within the jurisdiction of the board cannot be agendized. The board president and superintendent may determine if a request is primarily for informational purposes and may fulfill such a request by providing the desired information as appropriate.

## The role of board members during board meetings
The authority to direct action rests solely with the full board during public board meetings. A majority vote provides direction to the superintendent. By carefully reviewing the board packet prior to the board meeting, board members can contact the superintendent for questions about an item. All members share a common responsibility to ensure the Brown Act is followed.

## Individual board member’s request for information, materials or action
It is important for trustees to be well informed, as oversight of the district is one of the main functions of the board. Trustees recognize that they have no power as individuals to direct staff actions, and that compiling information in response to trustee requests can take staff away from their day-to-day operations of schools and the district. An individual board member will – insofar as possible – let the superintendent and staff know ahead of time when a request for information will be made in a public meeting, so the staff can be prepared to provide a thorough response. Staff will make every effort to ensure that board agenda items include thorough background and information. Requests for information not on the board agenda should be made to the superintendent who will ensure the appropriate staff person responds. All information provided by the administration in response to a request by a trustee shall be provided to all other trustees at the same time. Trustees should self-regulate the number of requests for information regarding issues not on the board agenda.

## Board meeting guidelines
It is important to recognize that a board meeting is the time for the board to do their work in public view. We agree to keep our focus on the best interest of our students at all times. After staff input and public comment, board members are encouraged to ask questions and explain their thinking related to the topic at hand. The board president recognizes members who desire to speak, alternating, so that all members have the opportunity to speak. There is not a time limit or limit to the number of questions or comments that a board member may make, but each board member should be respectful of giving other members the
<!-- Page 162 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Opportunity to Speak**

Nothing in this section will preclude members from speaking multiple times until all discussion is concluded.

Unless a point is important to further understanding of the immediate discussion, the board president will allow all other members to speak first and then add their comments or questions.

The rules contained in Appendix A, “San Juan Unified Rules of Order,” shall govern operations of board meetings unless they are in conflict with this handbook, board bylaws, or state or federal law. Where there is a conflict of the same, state then federal law supersedes existing regulations and policies.

**Public Comments**

Members of the public shall have an opportunity to address the board on any item of interest that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board (Education Code section 35145.4, Government Code section 54954.3). If the public comments on items not appearing on the posted board agenda, the board cannot take action or discuss the comments (Government Code section 54954.2), other than to briefly acknowledge the comments and, if desired, to ask staff for follow-up information.

**Voting**

A majority vote of all members of the board is necessary for the election of officers or for any other action by the board unless otherwise specified by law. Voting shall be by voice and the board administrative assistant records the votes by member, which is placed into the minutes of the meeting. Where a board member cannot participate, audibly in the vote, they may submit their vote in writing during the public meeting.

Unless otherwise provided by law, affirmative votes by a majority of the board’s membership are required to approve any action under consideration as allowable by quorum, regardless of the number of members present.

The board shall take no action outside of a public meeting except on those matters and under those conditions authorized for closed sessions (Government Code sections 54957, 54957.7; Board Bylaw 9323.2).

**Voting No or Abstaining**

Each trustee respects the right of other trustees to vote “no” on an issue. Everyone agrees it is a courtesy to the governance team to explain the reasons for the “no” vote, either during deliberation or before casting the vote.

A member may abstain from voting for any reason by announcing their abstention when a vote is called. Similar to a no vote, it is a courtesy to the governance team to explain the reason(s) for abstaining from a vote. If a member was absent at the previous meeting, it is customary to abstain from voting on the approval of that meeting’s minutes.

A member must recuse themselves from a vote if one of the following is true: 1) the matter directly involves a close relative of the board member (Education Code section 35707); 2) the vote is to replace the board member’s position on the board (Education Code section 35178); or 3) the matter involves a “remote interest(s)” as listed in Government Code section 1091. When any one of these conditions is met, a board member must recuse themselves by announcing their recusal when the topic is first announced for discussion and leaving the dais during the duration of discussion or action on that item.
<!-- Page 163 -->
# Quorum

A quorum is the minimum number of voting members who must be present at a properly called board meeting in order to conduct business in the name of the board; and is established when a majority of the board members (at least four of the filled positions) are in attendance (Education Code section 35164, Board Bylaw 9323).

12
<!-- Page 164 -->
# Additional Board Information

## Board-appointed/board-approved committees

Board members appoint community members to committees as determined in committee bylaws. Newly elected board members will be given the option to appoint their own committee members or continue with the current appointments.

Board members serve as the conduit between a board-appointed/board-approved committee and the board as a whole. Board members are not voting members of board-appointed/board-approved committees.

If a board member wants to attend a board-appointed/board-approved committee meeting of which they are not the board liaison, the board member should contact the board administrative assistant. This will eliminate the possibility of four or more board members being in attendance at the meeting.

## Electronic media

The Board of Trustees will use electronic media (e.g., email and texting) carefully to ensure that there is no violation of the Brown Act (Government Code sections 54950-54962). The Brown Act prohibits a majority of board members from exchanging information outside of a board meeting, or using a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to:
- discuss, deliberate, or take action on an item of business within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board,
- advance or clarify an issue,
- facilitate agreement or compromise or
- advance an ultimate resolution.

The board recognizes that by using “Reply All” in email responses, the email:
- becomes part of the deliberative process,
- creates a public record and
- inhibits opportunity for any other four board members to have a conversation on a topic.

Board members will be aware of, and follow, district policy as it pertains to electronic communication. The district is subject to requests for public documents as provided by the California Public Records Act (Government Code section 6250 et seq.). Public documents include emails, text messages and other correspondence from, and between, board members as well as from, and between, employees and board members, regardless of whether sent or received on district provided or personal devices or accounts.

Board members who engage constituents via social media are responsible for ensuring that opinions expressed are presented as their own and not those of the board and for following all applicable board policies and state and federal laws.

## Complaints from community/staff

When an issue is brought to a board member, the board member will use active listening to hear what the complaint or issue is. Board members need to remain cognizant of their responsibility for judicial review, staff and student confidentiality and due process when talking with the complainant.

Restate what the complainant has said to ensure that you have heard the information correctly. Ask the person what they would like the board member to do with the information and what the individual would like to see as a possible solution. Explain that you will be sharing the information with the superintendent.
<!-- Page 165 -->
Redirect the complainant to communicate with appropriate personnel and utilize the appropriate complaint procedure. Ask the individual to follow up if the problem isn’t resolved. Notify the superintendent as soon as possible with details of the complaint.

In order to support a positive working relationship among the San Juan Unified School District Board of Education, the staff, students and the community, we have reviewed and agreed to the norms and protocols outlined in the 2023 Governance Handbook. We shall renew these agreements annually.

Affirmed on this 11th day of April, ___ 20232024.

# San Juan Unified Rules of Order

San Juan Unified’s Board of Education and committees that operate under the Brown Act or Greene Acts utilize the following rules to govern operations during meetings of their bodies. District policy including administrative regulations and board policy as well as state and federal laws shall take precedence if in conflict with these rules.

## Amendments and Updates
These rules are based on Rosenberg’s Rules of Order (as published by the League of California Cities) designed for municipalities and civic organizations with modifications to meet the specific needs, practices and interests of the district. In connection with updates to the district’s Board Governance Handbook, district staff shall review any updates to Rosenberg’s Rules of Order to consider for adoption. The Board of Education shall approve all proposed changes to these rules before they become effective.

## The Role of the Chair
It is the responsibility of all members to understand the rules of parliamentary procedure, but it is the role of the chair to apply the rules to the operations of the meeting. The chair is supported in this function by staff as appropriate for the meeting body. As the chair has a larger role in the operation of the meeting, it is a courtesy that they offer comment on a matter before the body after other members and should refrain from making or seconding a motion unless convinced other members will not do so at that point in time.

### The Basic Format for an Agenda Item Discussion
A meeting is governed by the agenda and the agenda constitutes the body’s agreed-upon roadmap for the meeting. Each agenda item can be handled by the chair in the following basic format:
1. The chair should announce the agenda item number and subject and then invite the appropriate person(s) to report on the item, including any recommendations they may have.
2. Following the presentation, the chair should open public comment following the body’s public comment procedure. Speaking times for public comment are limited to 2 minutes per speaker. Total time for public speaking on a public item is determined by each body’s bylaws. If the item is a public hearing, the chair must open the public hearing before beginning public comment and close the public hearing upon conclusion of speakers.
3. The chair should ask members of the body if they have questions or comments regarding the item. Members may ask questions of the presenters and other members or offer comments for consideration. The chair should follow questions or comments after other members have had an opportunity. At the discretion of the chair, members may have additional opportunities to offer questions or comments.
4. Upon conclusion of discussion and questions by members, or as appropriate, the chair should invite a motion. The chair should announce the name of the member who makes the motion.
5. The chair should ask for a second to the motion. The chair should announce the name of the member who seconds a motion. All motions require a second.
6. The chair should check to make sure everyone understands the motion. This can be done by:
   a. The chair asking the maker of the motion to repeat it;
   b. The chair can repeat the motion; or
   c. The chair can ask the individual taking minutes to repeat the motion.
7. The chair should then invite discussion on the motion before the body. If no discussion is offered, or after discussion has ended, the chair should announce the body will vote on the motion.
8. The chair takes a vote by asking for the “ayes” and then asking for the “nays.” If members have not yet voted, then the chair should ask for “abstentions.”
9. The chair should announce the result of the vote and the action the body has taken.
<!-- Page 167 -->
# APPENDIX A – RULES OF ORDER

## Motions
Motions are the vehicles for decision-making by a body. A member makes a motion by preceding the member’s desired approach with the words, “I move…” The chair usually calls for a motion by inviting members of the body to make a motion, by suggesting a motion that another member then moves or by making the motion themselves. (Note: Chairs should refrain from making motions or seconding motions unless other members of the body do not offer.)

### Types of Motions
- **Basic Motion** – The basic motion is one that puts forward a decision for the body’s consideration. A basic motion might be: “I move that we create a five-member committee to plan our event.” A motion must have a second to be considered by the body.
  
- **Motion to Amend** – If a member wants to change a basic motion that is before the body, they would move to amend it. A motion to amend might be: “I move that we amend the motion to have a 10-member committee.”
  
- **Substitute Motion** – If a member wants to completely do away with the basic motion that is before the body, and put a new motion before the body, they would move a substitute motion. A substitute motion might be: “I move a substitute motion that we cancel the event this year.” “Motions to amend” and “substitute motions” are often confused, but they are quite different, and their effect (if passed) is quite different. A motion to amend seeks to retain the basic motion on the floor but modify it in some way. A substitute motion seeks to throw out the basic motion on the floor and substitute a new and different motion for it. The decision as to whether a motion is really a “motion to amend” or a “substitute motion” is left to the chair. If a member makes what that member calls a “motion to amend,” but the chair determines that it is really a “substitute motion,” then the chair’s designation governs.

A “friendly amendment” is a practical parliamentary tool that is simple, informal, saves time and avoids bogging a meeting down with numerous formal motions. It works in the following way: In the discussion on a pending motion, it may appear that a change to the motion is desirable or may win support for the motion from some members. When that happens, a member who has the floor may simply say, “I want to suggest a friendly amendment to the motion.” The member suggests the friendly amendment, and if the maker and the person who seconded the motion pending on the floor accept the friendly amendment, that now becomes the pending motion on the floor. If either the maker or the person who seconded rejects the proposed friendly amendment, then the proposer can formally move to amend. A “motion to reconsider” is a special and unique motion. Once a vote is taken by a body it is considered final and can only be reopened if a motion to reconsider is made and passed. A motion to reconsider requires a majority vote to pass like other basic motions, but there are two special rules that apply only to motions to reconsider. First, a motion to reconsider must be made at the meeting where the item was first voted upon. (This requirement can be suspended if motioned to do so and approved by a two-thirds majority.) Second, the motion to reconsider may only be made by certain members of the body. Accordingly, a motion to reconsider may only be made by a member who voted in the majority on the original motion. Any member may second the motion including those who voted in the minority. If the motion to reconsider passes, the original matter is back before the body and the new original motion is in order. The matter may be discussed and debated as if it were on the floor for the first time.

### Multiple Motions Before the Body
There can be up to three motions on the floor at the same time. The chair can reject a fourth motion until the chair has dealt with the three that are on the floor and has resolved them to avoid confusion. All  
16
<!-- Page 168 -->
# APPENDIX A – RULES OF ORDER

Motions must have been moved and seconded to be valid for consideration by the body; this includes basic motions, motions to amend and substitute motions.  
When there are two or more motions on the floor (which have all been moved and seconded) the vote should proceed first on the last motion that is made. For example, consider that 1) a basic motion is made followed by 2) a motion to amend and then 3) a substitute motion. The chair would first call for discussion and vote on the third motion, the substitute motion. If the substitute motion is approved, it replaces the basic motion and renders the motion to amend invalid and voting is over. If the substitute motion fails, the chair would then call for discussion and vote on the motion to amend. If approved, the amended motion would be considered for vote. If the amendment fails the original motion is then considered.

## Debate on Motions

Most motions are subject to discussion and debate by the body as long as members wish to discuss the item. Discussion remains open until such time that the chair determines it is time to move on and take action. There are exceptions when a motion is not debatable, and a chair must take an immediate vote if the motion is made and receives a second:  
- **Motion to adjourn** – This motion, if passed, requires the body to immediately adjourn to its next regularly scheduled meeting. It requires a simple majority vote.  
- **Motion to recess** – This motion, if passed, requires the body to immediately take a recess. Normally, the chair determines the length of the recess which may be a few minutes or several hours. It requires a simple majority vote.  
- **Motion to fix the time to adjourn** – This motion, if passed, requires the body to adjourn the meeting at the specific time set in the motion. It requires a simple majority vote.  
- **Motion to table** – This motion, if passed, requires discussion of the agenda item to be tabled, meaning an agenda item to be placed on “hold.” The motion can contain a specific time in which the item can come back to the body, or the motion can contain no specific time for the return of the item. If no specific time is included in the motion, those individuals responsible for setting the body’s agenda shall identify when the item returns for consideration by the body. Motions to table require a simple majority vote.  
- **Motion to limit debate** – The most common form of this motion is to say, “I move the previous question” or “I move the question” or “I call the question.” As a practical matter, when a member uses one of these phrases, the chair can expedite matters by treating it as a request rather than as a formal motion. The chair can simply inquire of the body “any further discussion?” If no one wishes to have further discussion, the chair can go right to the pending motion that is on the floor. However, if even one person wishes to discuss the pending motion further, then at that point, the chair should treat the call for the “question” as a formal motion and proceed to it. Motions to limit debate require a two-thirds vote.

## Majority and Super Majority Votes

All motions require at least a simple majority vote. A tie vote means the motion fails. For example, in a seven-member body, a vote of 4-3 passes a motion. A vote of 3-3 with one abstention means the motion fails. If one member is absent and the vote is 3-3 the motion still fails.  
There are exceptions when a motion requires a super majority vote:  
- **Motion to limit debate** - This motion ends debate on a motion before the body and requires a two-thirds vote to be approved.  
- **Motion to close nominations** – A motion to close nominations for officers (such as the chair) effectively cuts off the right of the minority to nominate officers and it requires a two-thirds vote to pass.  
- **Motion to object to the consideration of a question** - Normally, such a motion is unnecessary since the objectionable item can be tabled or defeated straight up. However, when members of a body do not want an item on the agenda to be considered, then such a motion is in order. It is not debatable, and it requires a two-thirds vote to pass.

## Counting Votes

Quorum is determined by the body’s bylaws or other governance documents.

<!-- Page 169 -->
# APPENDIX A – RULES OF ORDER

All motions must receive a second and an “aye” vote by a majority of the body to be adopted. Abstentions votes can be used to meet quorum requirements but are not calculated in determining the outcome of the vote.

## Courtesy and Decorum

Debate and discussion should be focused, but free and open. In the interest of time, the chair may, however, limit the time allotted to speakers, including members of the body. A member cannot generally interrupt a speaker however there are a few exceptions:

- **Privilege** – A member can call for a “point of privilege.” The chair should then interrupt to ask the interrupter to state their point. Appropriate points of privilege relate to anything that would interfere with the normal comfort of the meeting. For example, the room may be too hot or too cold, or a blowing fan might interfere with a person’s ability to hear.

- **Order** – A member can call for a “point of order.” Again, the chair would ask the interrupter to “state your point.” Appropriate points of order relate to anything that would not be considered appropriate conduct of the meeting. For example, if the chair moved on to a vote on a motion that permits debate without allowing that discussion or debate.

- **Appeal** – If the chair makes a ruling that a member of the body disagrees with, the member may appeal the ruling of the chair. If the motion is seconded, and after debate, if it passes by a simple majority vote, then the ruling of the chair is deemed reversed.

- **Call for orders of the day** – This is simply another way of saying “return to the agenda.” If a member believes that the body has drifted from the agreed-upon agenda, such a call may be made. It does not require a vote, and when the chair discovers that the agenda has not been followed, the chair simply reminds the body to return to the agenda item properly before them. If the chair fails to do so, the chair’s determination may be appealed.

- **Withdraw a motion** – During debate and discussion of a motion, the maker of the motion on the floor, at any time, may interrupt a speaker to withdraw his or her motion from the floor. The motion is immediately deemed withdrawn, although the chair may ask the person who seconded the motion if he or she wishes to make the motion and any other member may make the motion if properly recognized.
