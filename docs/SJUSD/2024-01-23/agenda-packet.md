**AGENDA ITEM:** G-6  
**MEETING DATE:** 01/23/2024  

**SUBJECT:** 2023-24 School Accountability Report Card (SARC)  
**DEPARTMENT:** Division of Teaching and Learning  

**CHECK ONE:**  
For Discussion: ☐  
For Action: ☑  
Report: ☐  
Workshop: ☐  
Recognition: ☐  
Emergency Action: ☐  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the 2023-24 SARCs for San Juan Unified School District schools.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Since November 1988, state law has required all public schools receiving state funding to prepare and distribute a SARC. The purpose of the report card is to provide parents and the community information about each public school, including its progress in achieving goals. SARCs provide a general, publicly available profile of a school for informational purposes only and are not attached to accountability for the school or the district.

SARCs are updated annually and posted on both state and local websites by February 1. Translated versions are made available for schools when a primary language represents 15% or more of the families at that school. The SARC contains information about the condition and performance of each California public school. This includes a school profile, demographic data, school safety and climate for learning information, academic data, school assessment completion rates, class sizes, teacher and staff information, curriculum and instruction descriptions, postsecondary preparation information, and fiscal and expenditure data.

SARCs published in 2023-24 contain data from the 2022-23 school year and are provided by both the California Department of Education (CDE) and the San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD). The CDE has not yet released all of its data; however, it will be included in the report card when released. Data provided by the district is available and included in the report card.

On February 1, SARCs for each school will be available on the district and school website by selecting “Menu,” “Our District,” “Planning and Data,” and “School Accountability Report Card (SARC).”

**SUBJECT:** Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP)  
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) Federal Addendum  

**DEPARTMENT:** Division of Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the updated LCAP ESSA Federal Addendum as required by the California Department of Education (CDE).

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
As a condition of receiving federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) funding, local educational agencies (LEA’s) are required to annually review and update the LCAP Federal Addendum which was approved by the California Department of Education (CDE) in 2019. A narrative for each of the following federally funded programs is provided in the addendum:  
- Title I (A) – Basic Grant  
- Title II (A) – Supporting Effective Instruction  
- Title III (A) – Language Instruction for English Learner  
- Title III (A) – Immigrant Fund  
- Title IV (A) – Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants  

A copy of the LCAP ESSA Federal Addendum is available in the superintendent’s office. The LCAP Federal Addendum does not require CDE approval but must remain on file in the event of a review.

### ACTION REQUESTED:  
The superintendent is recommending that the board receive a report on the activities and actions of the district’s Family and Community Engagement Department.  

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:  
San Juan Unified’s Family and Community Engagement Department works to connect schools, families and community in support of student success. The department encompasses efforts that include family education and staff development, community partnership development, volunteer support, problem resolution and new this year are efforts to expand access to experiential learning through field trips.  

In the area of family education, the department has worked to expand the Family Leadership Academy by continuing to support and engage participants once they complete the initial program. This has allowed our program graduates to remain connected and help mentor the next generation of participants. In supporting our staff development and learning, the department continues to offer a variety of supports, including the Neighborhood Learning Project which takes a data driven approach to encourage schools to reach into their communities. The FACE Mobile, launched last year, has been a huge success and continues to expand its reach with the support of community partners. Partnerships remain key to the department’s efforts and this year the Partnership Connection was launched to bring community organizations together to network and build supports across the region. The department’s newest effort has been to take on support for experiential learning through field trips by providing logistical support to the process and working to develop and connect community partners who can offer experiences for our students.

# Arcade Fundamental Middle School’s Proposed Name Change

**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Board of Education**  
**January 23, 2024**

---

## Background

- As Arcade Fundamental Middle School looks forward to the debut of its modernized campus in Fall 2024, the Arcade community explored potentially removing “Fundamental” from the school’s name.

- Historically, there have been inconsistent references to Arcade's official school name, Arcade Fundamental Middle School. Oftentimes, the school community refers to Arcade as simply Arcade Middle School, omitting the “Fundamental.”

- As Arcade Fundamental Middle School moves forward as a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) school, they have shifted their focus to collaboration, inquiry, and process-based learning.

1. **I agree that we should just name our arcade middle school**
   - Why is it important? Because people don’t use fundamental anymore and it is also hard to spell.
   - ⭐️ 3.2 stars
   - 20 ratings

2. **The focus should be on the school name: Arcade**
   - This is important because the name is the cornerstone of the school’s identity.
   - ⭐️ 3.5 stars
   - 27 ratings

3. **I didn’t see a place to comment about the word Fundamental. I’d like to see it stay.**
   - Want the “fundamental” values return to middle/high school (EC). As alumni of both Arcade and EC, we want to see strict academics/behavior standards.
   - ⭐️ 3.1 stars
   - 28 ratings

4. **I think with a new school there can be a new change of the school and it good to have a new name like just a arcade middle school it good for me its.**
   - It just weird just saying arcade fundamental middle school. It is lot to say it just might just be easier just to say arcade middle school.
   - ⭐️ 3.6 stars
   - 26 ratings

### Summary

- Based on the feedback collected, 68% of Arcade students, staff and community members agreed that the school name should be shortened to Arcade Middle School, as opposed to 14% who disagreed with the name change and 18% who had no preference.  
  - Facilities Committee approved the recommendation of a name change on  
    - December 5  
    - Cabinet discussed and approved the recommendation of a name change on  
    - December 18  
- As Arcade moves into its renovated facility and grows its status as a STEAM school, a name change to “Arcade Middle School” will accurately reflect students, staff and their educational values.

The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the proposed revisions to Board Policy 1312.3 Uniform Complaint Procedures.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Assembly Bill 1078, codified as Education Code section 202, sets new obligations under the Uniform Complaint Procedure (“UCP”) as it relates to the complaints on the refusal or prohibition of the use of instructional and supplemental material. The law states such action is a violation of Education Code section 220 and governs the UCP as the vehicle to file a complaint.

The proposed revisions are to mirror changes in state law and clean up, as recommended by California School Boards Association (“CSBA”).

**Status: ADOPTED**  

## Policy 1312.3: Uniform Complaint Procedures  
**Original Adopted Date:** 09/08/1992 | **Last Revised Date:** 10/27/2020 | **Last Reviewed Date:** 10/27/2020  

The governing board recognizes that the district has the primary responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations governing educational programs. The board encourages the early resolution of complaints whenever possible. To resolve complaints which may require a more formal process, the board adopts the uniform system of complaint processes specified in 5 CCR 4600-4670, and the accompanying administrative regulation.

### Complaints Subject to UCP

Discrimination includes, but is not limited to, the board's refusal to approve the use or prohibit the use of any textbook, instructional material, supplemental instructional material, or other curriculum for classroom instruction, or any book or other resource in a school library, on the basis that it includes a study of the role and contributions of any individual or group consistent with the requirements of Education Code 51204.5 and 60040, unless such study would violate Education Code 51501 or 60044. A complaint alleging such unlawful discrimination may, in addition to or in lieu of being filed with the district, be directly filed with the Superintendent of Public Instruction ("SPI"). (Education Code 243)

The board recognizes that alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") can, depending on the nature of the allegations, offer a process to reach a resolution to resolving a complaint in a manner that is acceptable to all parties. An ADR process ADR such as mediation may be offered to resolve complaints that involve more than one student and no adult. However, mediation shall not be offered or used to resolve any complaint involving sexual assault or where there is a reasonable risk that a party to the mediation would feel compelled to participate. The superintendent or designee shall ensure that the use of ADR is consistent with state and federal laws and regulations.

The district shall protect all complainants from retaliation. In investigating complaints, the confidentiality of the parties involved shall be protected as required by law. For any complaint alleging retaliation or unlawful discrimination (such as discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying), the superintendent or designee shall keep the identity of the complainant and/or the subject of the complaint, if he/she is different from the complainant, and/or the subject of the complaint if different from the complainant, confidential when appropriate and as long as the integrity of the complaint process is maintained.

When an allegation that is not subject to the UCP is included in a UCP complaint, the district shall refer the non-UCP allegation to the appropriate staff or agency and shall investigate and, if appropriate, resolve the UCP-related allegation(s) through the district's UCP process.

The superintendent or designee shall provide training to district staff to ensure awareness and knowledge of current law and related requirements related to UCP, including the steps and timelines specified in this policy and the accompanying administrative regulation.

The superintendent or designee shall maintain a record of each complaint and subsequent related actions, including steps taken during the investigation and all information required for compliance with 5 CCR 4631 and 4633.

Assembly Bill (“AB”) 1078 amends various provisions of the Education Code regarding instructional and supplemental materials, and policies related to nondiscrimination.

The proposed revisions are to mirror changes in state law and clean up, as recommended by California School Boards Association (“CSBA”).

![Policy 5145.3: Nondiscrimination/Harassment](https://via.placeholder.com/768x971.png?text=Policy+5145.3:+Nondiscrimination/Harassment)

**Board Policy Manual**  
**San Juan Unified School District**  
**Printed: 11/13/2023 04:05 PM**  
**Status: ADOPTED**  
**Original Adopted Date: 04/28/2015 | Last Revised Date: 04/25/2023 | Last Reviewed Date: 04/25/2023**

This policy shall apply to all acts constituting unlawful discrimination or harassment related to school activity or to school attendance occurring within a district school, to acts which occur off campus or outside of school-related or school-sponsored activities but which may have an impact or create a hostile environment at school, and to all acts of the Governing Board and the superintendent in enacting policies and procedures that govern the district.

The governing board desires to provide a welcoming, safe, and supportive school environment that allows all students equal access and opportunities in the district's academic, extracurricular, and other educational support programs, services, and activities. The board prohibits, at any district school or school activity, unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, and bullying targeted at any student by anyone, based on the student's actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, national origin, nationality, immigration status, ethnicity, ethnic group identification, age, religion, marital or parental status, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information, or affiliation with the Boys Scouts of America, or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.

This policy shall apply to all acts related to school activity or to school attendance occurring within a district school. (Education Code section 234.1) This policy shall also apply to acts which occur off campus or outside of school-related or school-sponsored activities but which may have an impact or create a hostile environment at school.

Unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, or bullying or the creation of a hostile environment, may result from physical, verbal, nonverbal, or written conduct based on any of the categories listed above. Unlawful discrimination also includes the creation of a hostile environment throughout which prohibited conduct is so severe, persistent, or pervasive that it affects a student's ability to participate in or benefit from an educational program or activity; creates an intimidating, threatening, hostile, or offensive educational environment; has the effect of substantially or unreasonably interfering with a student's academic performance; or otherwise adversely affects a student's educational opportunities.

Unlawful discrimination also includes disparate treatment of students based on one of the above identified categories above with respect to the provision of opportunities to participate in school programs or activities or the provision or receipt of educational benefits or services.

Because unlawful discrimination may occur when disciplining students, including suspension and expulsion, the superintendent or designee shall ensure that staff enforce discipline rules fairly, consistently and in a non-discriminatory manner, as specified in Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 5144 - Discipline, Board Policy and Administrative Regulation 5144.1 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process, and Administrative Regulation 5144.2 - Suspension and Expulsion/Due Process (Students With Disabilities).

The board also prohibits any form of retaliation against any individual who files, reports or participates in the reporting of unlawful discrimination, files or otherwise participates in the filing of a complaint, or investigates or participates in the reporting, or investigation of a complaint or report alleging unlawful.

discrimination, including discriminatory harassment, intimidation, or bullying. Retaliation complaints shall be investigated and resolved in the same manner as a discrimination complaint.

The superintendent or designee shall facilitate students' access to the educational program by publicizing the district's nondiscrimination policy and related complaint procedures to students, parents/guardians, and employees. In addition, the superintendent or designee shall post the district's policies prohibiting discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying and other required information on the district's website in a manner that is easily accessible to parents/guardians and students, in accordance with law and the accompanying administrative regulation. (Education Code sections 234.1, 234.6)

The superintendent or designee shall provide training and/or information on the scope and use of the policy and complaint procedures and take other measures designed to increase the school community's understanding of the requirements of law related to discrimination. The superintendent or designee shall regularly review the implementation of the district's nondiscrimination policies and practices and, as necessary, shall take action to remove any identified barrier to student access to or participation in the district's educational program. The superintendent or designee shall report their findings and recommendations to the board after each review.

Regardless of whether a complainant complies with the writing, timeline, and/or other formal filing requirements, all complaints alleging unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, or bullying, shall be investigated and prompt action taken to stop the discrimination, prevent recurrence, and address any continuing effect on students.

Students who engage in unlawful discrimination, including discrimination (including sexual harassment), intimidation, bullying, or retaliation, in violation of law, board policy, or administrative regulation shall be subject to appropriate consequence or discipline, which may include suspension or expulsion when the behavior is severe or pervasive as defined in Education Code section 48900.4. Any employee who permits or engages in prohibited discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, bullying, or retaliation shall be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.

All allegations of unlawful discrimination in district programs and activities shall be brought, investigated, and resolved in accordance with Board Policy 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures.

The district designates the individuals identified below as the employees responsible for coordinating the district's efforts to comply with applicable state and federal civil rights laws, including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, and to answer inquiries regarding the district's nondiscrimination policies.

The individual(s) shall also serve as the compliance officer(s) specified in AR 1312.3 - Uniform Complaint Procedures as the responsible employee to handle complaints alleging unlawful discrimination targeting a student, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, or bullying, based on the student’s actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, nationality, national origin, nationality, immigration status, ethnicity, ethnic group identification, ethnicity, age, religion, marital status, parental status, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information, or any other legally protected status or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics.

Any student who feels that they have been subjected to unlawful discrimination, including discriminatory harassment (including sexual harassment), intimidation, or bullying is strongly encouraged to immediately contact the general counsel, the principal, or any other district employee. Any student who observes any such incident is strongly encouraged to report the incident to the general counsel or principal, or any other district employee whether or not the victim files a complaint.
