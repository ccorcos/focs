SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
BOARD OF EDUCATION  

AGENDA ITEM: H.6  
MEETING DATE: 11/19/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Naming of Softball Field at San Juan High School  
**DEPARTMENT:** Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve naming the San Juan High School softball field for alumni Lex Von Bergen, Class of 1974, to read: Lex Von Bergen Field.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The San Juan High School community, in partnership with San Juan High School’s Class of 1974 and the Rotary Club of Citrus Heights, have collectively agreed upon the naming of the softball field to honor Lex Von Bergen, Class of 1974. Lex Von Bergen officially began playing softball at seven years old as a pitcher and was actively involved in supporting softball throughout her life. In 2019, Lex Von Bergen was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig’s Disease and dedicated her life to advancing treatment for this disease. Lex Von Bergen has been a strong supporter of the Citrus Heights community, and naming this field will honor her accomplishments.  

To gather community input, San Juan High School held an open Zoom meeting on September 26, 2024, for the community to share and hear the alumni proposal and recommend any other names. No other names were recommended.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements contained herein, the Parties agree as follows:

1. **Facilities.** This Agreement sets forth the terms of use by the Parties of certain Facilities owned by the other party located at the sites listed in Exhibit A attached hereto. The terms “Facility” or “Facilities” refer only to a facility or facilities located at the sites identified in Exhibit A including, any offices, multi-purpose rooms, classrooms, gymnasiums, playfields, playgrounds, stadiums, performing arts centers, turf fields, tracks, and swimming pools located on District property, and excluding all weight rooms located at District Facilities. Other real property owned by either party not expressly identified in Exhibit A (“Other Property”) shall not be considered Facilities subject to the terms of this Agreement. Use of Other Property shall be subject to separate agreement between the Parties. Use of Facilities for adult recreational programs shall not be subject to the terms of this Agreement and shall be subject to separate agreement between the Parties.

2. **Term.** The term of this Agreement shall commence on July 1, 2019 (“Effective Date”) and shall be for five (5) years (“Term”). This Agreement will automatically renew for five (5) additional five (5) year terms (each one, a “Renewal Term”) upon expiration of the initial term or then current term.

3. **Superseding All Prior Agreements.** This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of the Parties relating to the Facilities, and supersedes all prior understandings relating to them, whether written or oral including but not limited to the Prior Agreements. The Prior Agreements are hereby deemed terminated and shall have no further effect. There are no obligations, commitments, representations, or warranties relating to the Facilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement.

4. **Priority of Use.**

   a. To facilitate scheduling of the Facilities in a manner consistent with this section and to address other issues that may arise, the Parties shall meet quarterly during the months of February, May, August, and November to determine the Facilities needed by each party (“Coordination Meeting”). Each party shall provide a list to the other party of anticipated Facility use for youth activities and programs for the upcoming quarter prior to the Coordination Meeting.

   b. **District Facilities.** The District shall have exclusive use of District Facilities on all days in which school is in session from 7:30 am to 4:00 pm (“Regular School Hours”), absent any other agreement between the Parties determined pursuant to the District’s permit request process. The District shall have priority use of all Other Property, including park spaces adjacent to District schools (“Park Facilities”). The Park District shall have priority use over all parties except the District for youth activities and recreational programs at District Facilities, subject to making a request for
<!-- Page 47 -->
![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Attachment+2)

the District's Use of Facilities. Adult activities and recreational programs offered by Park District shall not have priority use over other parties and shall be scheduled in accordance with the District’s permit request process outlined in the Use of School Facilities and Grounds Handbook, attached hereto as Exhibit B.

c. Park District Facilities. Park District shall have priority use of all Park District Facilities over all parties including the District, except that the District shall have priority use of all Park District Facilities adjacent to District schools during Regular School Hours. The District shall have priority use over all parties except the Park District, subject to making a request for facilities in a manner consistent with the facility reservation process required by the Park District.

5. Facility Use Costs. Outside of weekdays from 7:00 am to 9:00 pm, each party shall pay for direct costs of weekend and non-school day use of Facilities in accordance with the fee structure outlined in the District’s Use of School Facilities and Grounds Handbook, attached hereto as Exhibit B, and the Park District’s fee structure attached hereto as Exhibit C. Notwithstanding payment for direct costs, if applicable, Park District shall pay direct use fees for use of District swimming pools, performing arts centers, stadiums, turf fields and tracks in accordance with the fee structure outlined Exhibit B. At each Coordination Meeting, the Parties shall determine any additional fee owed for use of the Facilities during the year and the owning party shall remit payment for such fees within thirty (30) days of the Coordination Meeting or prior to any scheduled event pursuant to the facility use process outlined in the Use of School Facilities and Grounds handbook.

6. No Third Party Users. All programs operated at a Facility by the non-owner of the Facility shall be operated under the direct supervision and control of the non-owner party. The non-owner party shall not permit any third party user to operate a program or otherwise use the Facilities as part of the non-owner party’s use under this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a third party user is any individual, organization, or other entity seeking to operate any program not operated by either Party. Any third party use of the Facilities shall, instead, be coordinated through the owner of the Facility.

7. Alcoholic Beverages and Smoking. The use and/or possession of tobacco, alcohol, and/or controlled substances are prohibited in or on District Facilities at all times. Smoking is prohibited on Park Facilities during Regular School Hours and shall only be permitted on Park District Facilities consistent with Park District policy during non-School Hours.

8. Custodial. After use, each party shall return the Facility to its condition prior to the party’s use. If restrooms are open during use or other routine custodial service is required, the party using the Facility shall provide custodial services unless another arrangement is mutually agreed upon and confirmed in writing. If either party fails to return the Facility to its condition prior to the party’s use, the party causing such failure shall pay for the costs associated with performing routine custodial services. The party owning the Facility shall.

invoice the using party within thirty (30) days of such activity. The using party shall pay any invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt.

9. **Utilities and Maintenance.**

   a. Each party shall generally pay for all utilities and maintenance of its own Facilities. However, if use of the Facilities causes extraordinary utility usage or wear on the Facilities, the party causing such extraordinary impacts shall pay for the costs associated with their activity as agreed upon mutually by both Parties. The party owning the Facility shall invoice the using party within thirty (30) days of such activity. The using party shall pay any invoice within thirty (30) days of receipt. At the Coordination Meeting, the Parties shall discuss any anticipated events that will impact utility and maintenance costs.

   b. Park District shall maintain the sports fields situated outside the Howe Elementary School perimeter fence and improvements made by Park District on such grounds.

   c. Park District shall maintain future improvements made by Park District on the sports fields situated inside the perimeter fence and grounds at Cottage Elementary School.

10. **Security.** All Facilities shall be maintained in a secure manner by the using party. An employee of the using party shall be responsible for opening and locking the Facility, and setting any alarms (as applicable) after each use. Neither party shall duplicate keys to any Facility or provide copies of keys to any third parties or other users that are not employees of the Parties.

11. **Damage to Property.** Park District shall be responsible for the cost of repair and/or replacement of any damage to District Facilities, including fixtures and improvements with the District Facilities that are lost, damaged, or stolen during and/or as the result of Park District’s use of District Facilities, normal wear and tear excepted.

<!-- Page 49 -->
![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+2)

of fields, play apparatuses, and installation of irrigation, to any District Facility, subject to a separate agreement with the District. The separate agreement shall address, at a minimum, responsibility for all costs associated with any improvements, responsibility for compliance with California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the Division of State Architects (DSA), the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), or the California Department of Education (CDE), and the terms of construction delivery including contracting with the architect and contractor.

**13. Indemnity.** To the fullest extent permitted by law, Park District shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless District and each of District’s officers, directors, officials, governing board, board members, employees, and authorized volunteers and agents from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, damages, and all expenses and costs incidental thereto (Collectively “Claims”), including costs of defense, settlement, arbitration, and reasonable attorneys’ fees, sustained by any person or to any property in, on, or about the Facilities resulting in injuries to or death of persons, including but not limited to employees of either party hereto, and damage to or destruction of property, including but not limited to the Facilities, arising out of, pertaining to, or resulting from the acts or omissions of Park District, its officers, directors, officials, governing board, board members, employees, authorized volunteers and agents, contractors, invitees, or guests.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, District shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Park District and each of Park District’s officers, directors, officials, governing board, board members, employees, and authorized volunteers and agents from and against any and all Claims, including cost of defense, settlement, arbitration, and reasonable attorneys’ fees, sustained by any person or to any property in, on, or about the Facilities resulting in injuries to or death of persons, including but not limited to employees of either party hereto, and damage to or destruction of property, including but not limited to the Facilities, arising out of, pertaining to, or resulting from the acts or omissions of District, its officers, directors, officials, governing board, board members, employees, authorized volunteers and agents, contractors, invitees, or guests.

It is the intention of the Parties that the provisions of this indemnity be interpreted to impose on each party responsibility to the other for the acts and omissions of their officers, directors, officials, employees, authorized volunteers and agents, contractors, invitees or guests. It is also the intention of the Parties that, where comparative fault is determined to have been contributory, principles of comparative fault will be followed and each party shall bear the proportionate cost of any Claims attributable to the fault of that party, its officers, directors, officials, employees, authorized volunteers and agents, contractors, invitees, or guests.

This indemnity shall not be limited by the types and amounts of insurance or self-insurance maintained by the Parties. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any duty to, any standard of care with reference to, or any liability or obligation, contractual or otherwise, to any third party. The provisions of this section shall survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement.

14. **Insurance.** Each party, at its sole cost and expense, shall carry commercial policies of insurance, or self-insure, its activities in connection with this Agreement, and obtain, keep in force and maintain, insurance or equivalent programs of self-insurance, for comprehensive general liability, which will insure District or Park District, as applicable, against liability for injury or death of persons and damage to the Facilities, as applicable. Each policy shall be for not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence for any one person injured or killed, and not less than $4,000,000 for property damage, and shall be maintained on an occurrence basis. Each party agrees to provide the other proof of such coverages on an annual basis, naming the other party as “additional insured” where appropriate and shall also provide thirty (30) days' advance written notice of any cancellation, termination or lapse of any of the insurance or self-insurance coverages. Failure to maintain insurance as required in this Agreement is a material breach of contract and may be grounds for termination of the Agreement.

15. **Termination.** Either party may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days’ written notice to the other party at any time, for any reason. Termination shall relieve both Parties of any further obligations under this Agreement.

16. **Compliance with Law; Limitations Upon Use.** Each party agrees to comply with all federal, state and local laws, statutes, codes, ordinances, rules, regulations, policies and requirements (collectively, “Law”) regarding their respective use of the Facilities under this Agreement. The Parties further agree that they shall not use Facilities, or allow them to be used, occupied, or improved under this Agreement in any manner or for any purpose that is in any way in violation of any Law. If any license, permit, or other governmental authorization is required for either party’s lawful use of the Facilities, such affected party shall procure and maintain same to the extent required by Law. Each party shall be solely and completely responsible for the safety of all persons and property associated with their respective use of the Facilities, and all materials, equipment, and supplies provided by such party during said use shall fully conform to all applicable Law.

17. **Fingerprinting.** To the extent that District determines it necessary that any employee, officer, or agent of Park District shall be required to submit fingerprints of any applicable employees, officers, or agents to the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) in accordance with Education Code section 45125.1, Park District agrees to make said individuals available for fingerprinting and to pay all associated costs with the DOJ screening process, unless such employee, officer, or agent of Park District has completed the Park District’s mandatory fingerprinting process. Park District further agrees that any persons who are not allowed by law to come into contact with District students as a result of said fingerprinting and screening shall be prohibited from accessing the District’s Facilities during Regular School Hours and during District events.

18. **Disputes.** If a dispute arises relating to the interpretation of, enforcement of, or compliance with the terms of this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve such dispute through informal discussions or other alternative means. Any party may convene such discussions by written notice, and shall reasonably accommodate the other party with

19. **Successors and Assignees.** All terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon all successors-in-interest, only to the extent that a different school district or municipality is the successor-in-interest. If either party sells any or all of the Facilities subject to this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to any remaining Facilities not sold or leased, but the availability of use of the Facility being sold or leased shall not run with the land and notwithstanding Section 13, this Agreement shall automatically terminate as to that Facility upon sale or lease of the Facility to a third party.

20. **Headings.** The headings of this Agreement are for convenience purposes only and shall not limit or define the meaning of the provisions of this Agreement.

21. **Governing Law and Venue.** This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and governed by, the laws of the State of California applicable to contracts to be performed wholly within this State. Any dispute arising from the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be heard by a court of competent jurisdiction located within Sacramento County.

22. **Attorneys’ Fees and Costs.** Any party may bring a suit or proceeding to enforce or require performance of the terms of this Agreement, and each party in that suit or proceeding shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees and costs.

23. **Construction.** The singular includes the plural, “shall” is mandatory, and “may” is permissive. The Parties acknowledge and agree that each of the Parties and each of the Parties’ attorneys have participated fully in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In cases of uncertainty as to the meaning, intent or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement, the Agreement shall be construed without regard to which of the Parties caused, or may have caused, the uncertainty to exist. No presumption shall arise from the fact that particular provisions were or may have been drafted by a specific party, and prior versions or drafts of this Agreement may be used to interpret the meaning or intent of this Agreement or any provision thereof.

24. **Notices.** Any notice to be given hereunder to either party shall be in writing and shall be given either by personal delivery (including express or courier service), by e-mail, by receipt-confirmed facsimile, by registered or certified mail, with return receipt requested and postage prepaid (excluding electronic messaging) and addressed as follows:

BOARD OF EDUCATION  

AGENDA ITEM: H.8  
MEETING DATE: 11/19/2024  

SUBJECT: Gateway International School Phase II Project CEQA Categorical Exemption  
DEPARTMENT: Operations  

ACTION REQUESTED:  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Notice of Exemption for phase two of the Gateway International School (GIS) campus project, located at 900 Morse Avenue, Sacramento, California.  

RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:  
The proposed project is located entirely within the Gateway International School campus at 900 Morse Avenue (APN: 286-3210-010) in Sacramento, California. The project area primarily spans approximately preexisting landscaped and paved areas within the school’s boundaries. The project scope includes the addition of four modular classroom buildings, one modular restroom building, and two kindergarten classrooms. The scope also includes the replacement of a turf landscape area with a new kindergarten play area, the upgrade of existing turf playfields, and the addition of outdoor shade structures on existing hardcourt paved areas.  

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 15300 et seq.

**RE:**  
Gateway International School (GIS) Phase 2 Project  
CEQA Categorical Exemption  
Terracon Project No: NB247198  

---

**Project Information:**  
The proposed project is located entirely within Gateway International School’s campus at 900 Morse Avenue (APN: 286-3210-010), in Sacramento, California. The project area primarily spans approximately preexisting landscaped and paved areas within the school’s boundaries (Exhibit 1). The project scope includes the addition of four modular classroom buildings, one modular restroom building, and two kindergarten classrooms. The scope also includes the replacement of a turf landscape area with a new kindergarten play area, the upgrade of existing turf playfields, and the addition of outdoor shade structures on existing hardcourt paved areas.

As the actions associated with the proposed project are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact, it is expected that this project is exempt under the Class XIV Categorical Exemption (Minor Additions to Schools), as described in the California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 15300 et seq.

---

**Legal Setting:**  
Categorical Exemptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300)  
Projects that are not expected to result in a significant environmental impact may be Categorically Exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review. As described in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300, Section 21084 of the Public Resources Code requires these guidelines to include a list of classes of projects which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall, therefore, be exempt from the provisions of CEQA. In response to that mandate, the Secretary for Resources has found that the following classes of projects listed in this article do not have a significant effect on the environment, and they are declared to be categorically exempt from the requirement for the preparation of environmental documents.

Like many school-renovation projects that do not involve increasing student capacity, the proposed project is not expected to result in any significant environmental impacts under CEQA.

**CEQA Categorical Exemption Memorandum**  
GIS Phase 2 Project | Sacramento, California  
October 11, 2024 | Terracon Project No. NB247198  

**Table 1 provides an abbreviated CEQA checklist, explaining why the implementation of the proposed project would not result in any significant environmental impacts.**

**Table 1. Abbreviated CEQA Environmental Checklist**

| Impact Category                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aesthetics                          | The proposed project would not result in impacts related to scenic vistas, state-listed scenic highways as the nearest scenic location is the California State Route 160, approximately 22 miles southwest of campus. Further, it would not require the installation of equipment that would be inconsistent with previous conditions; and would not result in an impact on Aesthetics. |
| Agriculture and Forestry Resources  | The proposed project would not involve agricultural lands or Prime Farmland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Air Quality                         | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of pollutants or odors to sensitive receptors. Although Sacramento County is in nonattainment status for PM-2.5 (2006) and 8-Hour Ozone (2015) criteria pollutants, the proposed project would not result in a significant net increase of such pollutants, nor would the project conflict with the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD)’s ability to comply with any applicable State Implementation Plan (SIP) as the emissions would be associated with the limited use of construction equipment. |
| Biological Resources                | The project area is not expected to provide habitat for federally- or state-listed species, nor would it affect a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP), Natural Community Conservation Planning (NCCP), or other sensitive biological resources as no habitat for listed species is present.                                                                 |
| Cultural Resources                  | The project does not contain known historic properties and is not suspected of containing archaeological artifacts as the general area is previously developed. If archaeological or cultural resources are discovered onsite, work would cease immediately until consultation and approval to continue work was provided by a qualified archaeologist. |
| Energy                              | The proposed project would not result in an impact related to the wasteful or inefficient use of energy since the project will not require the use of equipment with high energy requirements during its operations.                                                                                                                                  |

**CEQA Categorical Exemption Memorandum**  
**GIS Phase 2 Project | Sacramento, California**  
**October 11, 2024 | Terracon Project No. NB247198**

| **Category**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Geology and Soils**           | The proposed project would not result in geological impacts. The project construction would take place on previously developed and disturbed land and would not result in new construction in unsafe soils.                           |
| **Greenhouse Gas Emissions**     | Although greenhouse gases would be emitted during project construction, the overall effect would be negligible due to the short-term and limited scope of the project. It would not result in a significant impact on the environment, nor would it conflict with a plan, policy, or regulation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. |
| **Hazards and Hazardous Materials** | The proposed project would not involve the use or release of potentially hazardous substances. Abatement of Hazardous Materials Plan (AHMP) will be created prior to project construction to handle potential unexpected encounters with hazardous materials. |
| **Hydrology and Water Quality**  | Local water quality impacts would be avoided by the usage of routing stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) during construction and material staging activities.                                                                 |
| **Land Use and Planning**        | The proposed project would not divide an established community, nor would it result in a conflict with a land use plan or zoning ordinance as the project does not modify existing land use.                                        |
| **Mineral Resources**            | The proposed project would not require the extraction of Mineral Resources.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Noise**                        | The proposed project would not result in the exposure of excessive noise levels. Construction would not take place during the school year. Further, measures such as limiting construction to daytime hours and complying with County noise ordinances would avoid temporary construction-related noise impacts. The project would not result in any permanent noise impacts. |
| **Population and Housing**       | The proposed project would not involve housing or population growth.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Public Services**              | The proposed project would not negatively affect public services and will likely improve the school’s ability to provide resources for their students.                                                                                 |
| **Recreation**                   | The proposed project would not lead to the deterioration of existing recreational facilities, nor would it involve the construction of new facilities that would result in an adverse physical environmental consequence.                |

**CEQA Categorical Exemption Memorandum**  
GIS Phase 2 Project | Sacramento, California  
October 11, 2024 | Terracon Project No. NB247198  

### Transportation
The proposed project would not have a significant effect on transportation since the bulk of construction is not occurring near a main thoroughfare. Further, construction will occur outside of the school year when student traffic patterns will not be affected by the work.

### Tribal Cultural Resources
The proposed project would not have the capability to impact a listed or eligible resource as there are no known relationships to the site; however, if resources are discovered during any ground disturbing activities, work will cease immediately and both federally and state recognized tribes will be contacted.

### Wildfire
The proposed project does not involve Wildfire Hazards since the project will not increase fire loading.

### Mandatory Findings of Significance
The proposed project does not have the potential to substantially degrade or reduce the habitat of a species or impact known resources. The project would not result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a cumulative impact.

---

### Exceptions (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15300.2)
It should be noted that six (6) exceptions are described, which if applicable to a project, would disqualify the project from the usage of a Categorical Exemption. These exceptions are:

(a) **Location.** Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to be located – a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

(b) **Cumulative Impact.** All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.

(c) **Significant Effect.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

(d) **Scenic Highways.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.

(e) **Hazardous Waste Sites.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.

(f) **Historical Resources.** A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

**CEQA Categorical Exemption Memorandum**  
GIS Phase 2 Project | Sacramento, California  
October 11, 2024 | Terracon Project No. NB247198  

**Categorical Exemption Class XIV – Minor Additions to Schools (Cal. Code Regs.tit. 14 § 15314)**  
Class 14 projects are described in § 15314 as “minor additions to existing schools within existing school grounds where the addition does not increase original student capacity by more than 25% or ten classrooms, whichever is less.” The project would take place entirely within Gateway International School’s existing property and would not involve the addition of at least ten new classrooms, nor would it increase the school’s student capacity by more than 25%. The proposed project fits the description provided in Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15314.

**Summary:**  
The proposed project would not result in any significant impacts to the environment (please see Table 1). The activities that make up the proposed project (addition of classrooms, restroom building, outdoor shade structures, the replacement of a turf landscape area, and the upgrade of existing turf playfields) meet both the description of a Class 14-exempt project as well as the criteria listed in the Exceptions to CEQA Categorical Exemptions. The project area is not located on a hazard waste site or other environmental feature of critical concern. The proposed project would not result in a significant impact, nor would it result in a cumulatively considerable contribution to a significant cumulative impact.

The long-term effect of the project will likely be the improvement of the school’s ability to accommodate its students. The project site is not in the vicinity of a Scenic Highway, and the project would not be expected to impact historical resources. No historic properties are known to exist in the project area; if artifacts were to be found during construction, work would stop immediately, and a qualified archaeologist would be consulted before work were to resume.

Avoidance and minimization measures would be incorporated to avoid impacts to biological resources. Such measures include limiting any tree removal to outside of the California nesting bird season (Feb 1 through Aug 31). Alternatively, if vegetation removal was needed during the nesting period, a nesting bird survey would be required. If nesting birds were found, the San Juan Unified School District would be responsible for establishing no-work buffers, as necessary, with the input of CDFW, before the commencement of construction or tree removal activities.

Considering the data summarized in this memorandum, it is Terracon’s opinion that the Gateway International School GIS Phase 2 Project is Categorically Exempt from CEQA documentation.

**Purchase Agreement Amendment #1**  
**BP #25-202 Districtwide Furniture**  

Effective **November 19, 2024** the Purchase Agreement dated October 8, 2024 between the San Juan Unified School District and Jones Campbell Keller Co., Inc. dba Campbell Keller for the Districtwide Furniture (BP#25-202) and Notice to Proceed template is amended as follows:

This amendment clarifies that the Notice to Proceed (NTP) will initiate a collaborative process between the District and the Vendor to determine the specific furniture items required for the project.

The Purchase Agreement is modified:  

1. **Page 1, Item 1: Notice to Proceed.** Vendor agrees that a Notice to Proceed shall trigger parties’ obligations to purchase and deliver Items as described in that particular Notice to Proceed for the specified project. The date of commencement of parties’ obligations is the date established in the Notice to Proceed. The date of commencement shall not be postponed by the failure to act of the Bidder or of persons or entities for whom the Bidder is responsible. District is only responsible for payment to Vendor for furniture identified in a Notice to Proceed. District is not responsible for payment to Vendor for furniture estimates included in the Bid Form.  
   To read: **Notice to Proceed.** Vendor agrees that a Limited Notice to Proceed (LNTP) shall trigger the process of determining the furniture items required for the specified project. Upon issuance of an LNTP, the parties shall collaborate to identify the furniture items necessary to meet the District's site-specific requirements. Vendor agrees to work with the District to develop a detailed furniture schedule, including itemized lists, quantities, and specifications to be incorporated in a final purchase order for each LNTP under this Agreement. The District shall provide any necessary site-specific information and requirements to facilitate this process. The date of commencement of parties’ involvement is the date established in the LNTP. The date of commencement shall not be postponed by the failure to act of the Bidder or of persons or entities for whom the Bidder is responsible. District is only responsible for payment to Vendor for furniture identified in the final purchase order associated with the LNTP. District is not responsible for payment to Vendor for furniture estimates included in the Bid Form or LNTP.  

2. **Page 1, Item 2: Location for Delivery.** Vendor agrees to deliver the Items to District at various locations within the District. Delivery locations will vary based on the installation location for the ordered items and be included in the Notice to Proceed.

Specifications and any addenda. Time is of the essence in this Contract. If Vendor fails to satisfactorily and timely deliver the Items, the District may purchase items from other sources and recover damages from Vendor as allowed by applicable law, including but not limited to the purchase cost in excess of the contract price (see next section) and other costs incurred due to the Vendor’s failure to timely deliver.

To read: Time for Delivery. Vendor shall satisfactorily and timely deliver the Items in full to the District as specified in the District’s bid package documents for BP #25-202 (“Bid Package”) and as identified in the Notice to Proceed and associated Purchase Order, including but not limited to the Purchase Specifications and any addenda. Time is of the essence in this Contract. If Vendor fails to satisfactorily and timely deliver the Items, the District may purchase items from other sources and recover damages from Vendor as allowed by applicable law, including but not limited to the purchase cost in excess of the contract price (see next section) and other costs incurred due to the Vendor’s failure to timely deliver.

4. Page 2, Item 4: Liquidated Damages. Failure to complete the work within the time and in the manner provided for in this Contract for each individual Notice to Proceed shall subject the Vendor to liquidated damages. The actual occurrence of damages and the actual amount of the damages which the District would suffer if the Contract were not completed within the specified times set forth are dependent upon many circumstances and conditions which could prevail in various combinations and, from the nature of the case, it is impracticable and extremely difficult to fix the actual damages. Damages which the District would suffer in the event of delay include, but are not limited to, loss of the use of the Contract, disruption of activities, costs of administration, supervision and the incalculable inconvenience and loss suffered by the public.

Accordingly, the Parties agree that the amount herein set forth shall be the amount of damages which the District shall directly incur upon failure of the Vendor to complete the Contract within the time specified: $100 (per classroom only), for each calendar day by which completion of the Contract is delayed beyond the Completion Deadline as specified in the Notice to Proceed.

Accordingly, the Parties agree that the amount herein set forth shall be the amount of damages which the District shall directly incur upon failure of the Vendor to complete the Contract within the time specified: $100 (per classroom only), for each calendar day by which completion of the Contract is delayed beyond the Completion Deadline as specified in the Notice to Proceed and/or associated Purchase Order.

In case of such termination for the District’s convenience, the Vendor shall be entitled to receive payment for Items described in a Notice to Proceed issued prior to the effective date of the

WHEREAS, the District has encountered soil conditions constituting unexpected, differing site conditions on the Project site which the district is required by law to remediate, in a manner approved by the State Department of Toxic Substances Control, and which remediation must be done promptly to avoid further delay to the Project; and

WHEREAS, the cost to thoroughly remediate the differing conditions will largely exhaust the District Contingency (sometimes referred to as the “Owner Contingency”), leaving the district effectively without a contingency to address the types of matters generally covered by the District Contingency on a lease-leaseback project; and

WHEREAS, the district recommends supplementing the District Contingency by an additional one million, one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($1,150,000.00), which the district believes will be sufficient to provide for a reasonable contingency in connection with remaining Project work; and

NOW, THEREFORE, the San Juan Unified School District Board of Education does hereby resolve as follows:

### Section 1.
The foregoing recitals are hereby adopted as true and correct.

### Section 2.
The Board approves the Facilities Lease amendments stated in Amendment #7, including supplementing the District Contingency as recommended.

# Thomas Coleman ES Construction Schedule Extension Narrative

As we near the end of the original construction schedule, some additional site modifications have been requested by the San Juan Unified School District Project Manager to be completed by CORE. The list of items and general descriptions are listed below. These additional items have labor efforts and material procurement durations that will push out beyond the original Construction Schedule. We are currently requesting a revised construction completion date of **12/31/2024** in order to complete the additional requested items.

- **Revision to Ornamental Service Gates at Utility Yard** – The original design calls for a new ornamental fence to be installed around the North perimeter of the site. There is an existing electrical utility yard that would be located within the new perimeter fencing. In order for the utility company that services this utility yard to have access, a double gate will need to be installed. The components and materials for these added gates have extended procurement dates that will go beyond the original construction completion date.

- **New Ornamental Gate at AT&T Ground Utility Box** – The above noted new perimeter ornamental fence also spans across an AT&T and Comcast ground utility box. In order to give the companies access to service their utilities, it was requested that a portion of the ornamental fencing be removed, and a service gate be installed in this area. The components and materials for this added gate has extended procurement dates that will go beyond the original construction completion date.

- **New 3ft Ornamental Fencing at Concrete Wall** – There is an existing concrete wall on the hardcourt that has an older chain link fence that is in poor condition. It was requested that the original chain link fence be removed, the concrete wall repaired and a new 3ft tall ornamental fence installed. The components and materials for this added fencing have extended procurement dates that will go beyond the original construction completion date.

- **New 6ft Tall Chain Link Fencing** – There is an existing 6' chain link fence around the South perimeter of Building D that is in poor condition. It was requested that this existing fencing and posts be removed, new posts installed, and black vinyl coated chain link be installed. There will also be (2) 3' pedestrian gates, (1) 6' service gate and (1) 8' service gate installed in this fence system. The components and materials for this added fencing and gates have extended procurement dates that will go beyond the original construction completion date.

- **Existing Sunshade Replacement Canopy** – There is an existing sunshade structure located on the South side of Building D that has a poor condition. It was requested that we remove the existing canopy and replace it with duplicate of the original. The components and materials for this replacement canopy have extended procurement dates that will go beyond the original construction completion date.

- **Additional Backpack Hook Installation** – The original contract called for new backpack hooks to be installed throughout the campus at the various buildings. Unfortunately, one of the buildings is made up of aluminum storefront and anchoring into this system will create a potential for water intrusion. It was requested that we install a free-standing backpack system using steel posts that are embedded in concrete. The components and materials for these added posts are made of the same materials as the fencing and therefore have extended procurement dates that will go beyond the original construction completion date.

- **Existing Multipurpose Room Exterior Door Modification** – There is an existing door in the Multipurpose Room that requires modification in order for it to function as desired for the space. The components and materials necessary to complete the modification have extended procurement dates that will go beyond the original construction completion date.

- **Added Chain Link Access Gate at Portable** – There is an existing chain link fence around the perimeter of a portable used by the campus. This perimeter fence does not have a dedicated entry point for routine maintenance. It was requested that we remove a portion of the existing chain link fence and fabricate an access gate in this area. The components and materials for this added gate has extended procurement dates that will go beyond the original construction completion date.

# BASIS OF ESTIMATE  
**ENCINA HIGH SCHOOL NON-DSA MODERNIZATION**  
**OCTOBER 21, 2024**  

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT – CALIFORNIA**  

The Basis of Estimate is a written explanation clarifying the scope, assumptions and exclusions used in establishing the Encina High School Non-DSA Modernization Total Base Rent #1 (TBR) Proposal, dated October 21, 2024. The estimate is presented in a ten group, systems format best utilized for analyzing and comparing project costs during design and preconstruction. This estimate is based on CORE’s incorporation of the limited scope, as described below, and shown on the Encina HS Light Mod Scope R2 document dated 10/2/2024 as well as the scope clarifications below.  

## ASSUMPTIONS, CLARIFICATIONS, & EXCLUSIONS  

### Schedule  
As directed by SJUSD, CORE has developed an initial, Non-DSA Modernization, TBR #1 package to prepare the campus for the Encina High School Full Site Renovation Project. This scope of this Non-DSA TBR #1 work primarily consists of the Light Mod and Classroom Refresh Project. Scope of work for this includes electrical safeoff and demo, plumbing cut/cap and sink removals, casework removals, abatement of hazardous asbestos containing floors, full abatement of buildings O & Q, new flooring, and new painting of the interior of the classrooms. This scope of work is anticipated to begin January 2, 2025 and be completed by November 23, 2026. The current plan is to execute an additional, TBR #2 for the complete package of the DSA set of drawings for the full site renovation at a board meeting on May 13, 2025. If TBR #2 is not approved by May 13, 2025 CORE reserves the right to re-evaluate construction sequencing, general conditions, and general requirement costs. If TBR#2 is not approved by the time TBR#1 scope of work is completed, CORE will consider the initial contract completed and demobilize. It is CORE’s true intent to remain flexible and work with the District toward accomplishing all goals of this project.  

CORE will utilize Microsoft Project as the scheduling management program for this project. CORE anticipates normal working hours, Monday through Friday and is assuming zero weather days for the work associated with this GMP.  

The successful completion of this project is incumbent on the following key milestones.  

### Key Milestone Dates –  
- TBR #1 Board Approval: November 19, 2024  
- TBR #1 On-Site Construction Beginning: January 2, 2025  
- DSA Project TBR #2 Board Approval: May 13, 2025  
- TBR #2 On-Site Construction Beginning: June 10, 2025  
- Anticipated TBR #1 Scope Completion Date: November 10, 2025  

### Cost  
This estimate is based on current Prevailing Wage Rates and includes sales tax. All on site labor will comply with Skilled and Trained Workforce requirements. This TBR #1 assumes ten (10) months of

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT – CALIFORNIA**  

General conditions (January 2025-October 2025.) Once board approved, TBR #2 will carry general conditions from November 2025 to end of construction. The estimated value provided in the proposal includes all direct and indirect construction costs but does not include typical project “soft costs”. These costs include, but are not limited to design professional fees, permits and plan review fees, utility connection fees, land acquisition costs, “loose” furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF&E), special inspections, etc.

## Contingencies  
Contingencies have been included in the GMP to cover the following items:  
- **Contractor Construction Contingency** – Contractor Construction Contingency is included in this proposal and is intended to be used at CORE’s discretion to cover costs that have not been completely identified as trade specific scope on the TBR setting documents may require further clarification or coordination. These costs include, but not limited to, scope gap, coordination issues between trades, potential overtime, missed general requirements, and missed scope during the bidding process. The Contractor Construction Contingency is not intended to account for design revisions or additional scope requests by the design/owner during construction.  
- **Owner Project Contingency** – Owner Project Contingency is included in this TBR. Owner Project Contingency is intended to be used at the Owner’s discretion to cover unforeseen conditions, including overtime due to these conditions, design revisions, errors/omissions and/or additional scope requests made by the owner and/or design team.

## Allowances  
Allowances have been included in the GMP to cover the following items:  
- **Additional Drywall Patching Allowance** – CORE has included an allowance to cover any costs associated with drywall patch and repair above and beyond what would be typically assumed in the drywall patching scope based on the casework demolition and removing all wall mounted items. We are assuming all wall mounted items including but not limited to white boards, tack boards, visual display boards, phones, fire extinguishers not to be larger than 1/8-inch screw holes.  

Any allowances not used will be returned to the Owner. Any additional funds needed for these allowances will be funded from the Owner Project Contingency.

## General Assumptions  
- This cost proposal is considered lump sum, not line itemed. Scope values are provided for transparency and as a contract schedule of values.  
- CORE’s proposal is for construction costs only, unless otherwise specified.

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT – CALIFORNIA**

- The Proposal includes a lump sum amount for general conditions, general requirements, and temporary construction requirements. Project general conditions, general requirements and temporary construction costs will be paid monthly as a lump sum per approved billing schedule.
- The Proposal excludes repairs of any existing damages or deficiencies to the site and/or facilities unless clearly indicated in the Contract Documents.
- As the TBR proposal is lump sum, savings are not fully realized until substantial completion.
- This project is proceeding without DSA approval or permits. The client assumes full responsibility for compliance with regulations and agrees to indemnify the construction company against any resulting claims or penalties.
- The Client will have all necessary leasing or ownership agreements for the property in place in advance of the anticipated start date. CORE shall be granted an extension of time for delays resulting and potential adjustment of the TBR via change order if accelerating the schedule is required resulting from the Client not having all necessary property procurement documentation and legal action complete prior to mobilization.
- Due to current volatile market conditions, all parties acknowledge that some of the materials and products to be used and installed in the construction of this project may become unavailable, delayed in shipment and/or subject to price increase due to circumstances beyond the control of the Contractor, including COVID-19 pandemic. If a specified product is unavailable or shipment is delayed, Contractor shall provide written notice and shall be afforded additional time and substitute products may be considered. If there is an increase in the price of materials, equipment, or products between the date of this contract and the time when the job is ready for the installation of the affected material, the amount of this contract shall be increased to reflect the additional cost to obtain the materials, provided that the contractor gives the Owner written notice and documentation of the increased costs.
- The lease payment value shall be 3% of the TBR value and amortization at 1% over 12-months post construction. The lease payment value shall be withheld during construction as a separate schedule of value line item and shall represent the required 5% retention. Therefore, no other retention will be withheld at each progress billing. The District shall exercise an early buy-out of the entire lease payment value between 60-90 calendar days after substantial completion.

## Specific Exclusions
- Typical Project “Soft Costs” unless otherwise specified. These include, but are not limited to: design professional costs, permits and fees, utility connection charges other than for temporary utilities, land acquisition, legal fees, equipment and furnishings, etc.
- “Loose” furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E).
- Power company/communication companies (telephone/internet)/gas company costs other than trenching, backfill, conduits and coordination.
- Servers, equipment, etc.
- Testing and inspection services of special inspectors.

# Fiscal Year 2025–26 Continued Funding Application  
**DUE DATE:** 5:00 p.m. November 1, 2024  

Contractors holding a current California State Preschool Program (CSPP) contract, and if applicable a Prekindergarten and Family Literacy Support (CPKS) contract, who wish to be considered for continued funding for fiscal year (FY) 2025–26 must complete this application for continued funding. The FY 2025–26 CFA Overview and Instructions may be accessed on the California Department of Education (CDE) CFA web page located at [CDE CFA Overview](https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/cd/ci/cfa2526.asp). Contractors are strongly encouraged to review the CFA Overview and Instructions before and after completion of the CFA and associated documents to confirm that the application and forms submitted for their agency have been completed in accordance with all applicable instructions.

Current contractors who apply for and are approved for continued funding do not need to sign a contract with the CDE to provide CSPP and CPKS services for FY 2025–26. Contracts will be automatically renewed in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws and Contract Terms and Conditions (CTCs). By signing this CFA, the contractor is indicating that it wishes to automatically renew its contract(s) for FY 2025–26 and accepts all of the terms and conditions of the 2025–26 CSPP contract, and if applicable the 2025–26 CPKS contract, which will be provided to the contractor no later than June 1, 2025.

Upon receipt of this CFA, the CDE will review the application and may contact your agency seeking additional information. If the CFA is returned to the CDE in a timely manner but is not fully and accurately completed, funding for FY 2025–26 may be delayed.

Please also note that contractors have no vested right to a subsequent contract. Completion of this CFA does not guarantee a renewal of funding. If the CDE determines your agency will not be renewed for a subsequent contract year, you will be notified in writing no later than April 7, 2025, pursuant to the California Code of Regulations, Title 5 (5 CCR) Section 17828.

Contractors that wish to reject the terms of the FY 2025–26 CSPP and/or CPKS contract must provide the CDE with a written notice that the terms of the contract(s) are rejected by sending an email to EarlyEducationContracts@cde.ca.gov on or before June 30, 2025. The email should come from the Executive Director/Superintendent of the contracting entity or their authorized representative and state that the terms of the FY 2025–26 CSPP and, as applicable, the CPKS contract are rejected. Contractors providing such notice to the CDE of the rejection of the terms of the contract will not have contract(s) in effect for FY 2025–26. Contractors cannot reject their CSPP contract and still receive funding under a CPKS contract as CPKS funding is tied to having a CSPP contract. If no notice is sent to the CDE, the contract will be automatically renewed, and no further action will be required from the contractor.

If a contractor wishes to terminate the contract for any reason during the FY 2025–26 contract period, the contractor shall notify the CDE of its intent to terminate the contract at least 90 calendar days in advance of contract termination and shall follow 5 CCR 17795.

If you have any questions regarding the CFA, please contact the CFA team by sending an email to CFA@cde.ca.gov.

### Section VI – Contractor Certification

Under penalty of perjury, I certify the following statements as true and correct to the best of my knowledge:

- I have read and understand the staffing requirements for Program Director, Site Supervisor, and Teacher. All staff employed by the contractor for the provision of preschool services are fully qualified for their respective positions. The exception to this certification is a person employed as Program Director or Site Supervisor who possesses a current Staffing Qualifications Waiver approved by the Early Education Division.
  
- I am authorized by the contractor’s Board of Directors or other governing authority to execute this CFA, signifying their intent to automatically renew the current CSPP contract, and CPKS contract if applicable, for FY 2025–26, under new terms and conditions to be established by the CDE, unless rejected in writing prior to the effective date of the new contract(s) on June 30, 2025.
  
- On behalf of the contractor and its governing authority, I understand that some information requested in this CFA is intended for use by CDE auditors in connection with future audit work and performance reviews and may not be used, reviewed, or considered by the CDE until after the contract has expired, if ever. Therefore, the contractor further understands that the information (and any underlying information) disclosed by this CFA shall not be considered properly noticed to the CDE, nor approved, accepted, or authorized by the CDE, even if the contractor's request for continued funding by the CDE is subsequently approved.
  
- The governing board members or persons with governing authority have been trained in understanding conflict of interest requirements associated with their positions on the board and have reported all known conflicts of interest.
  
- As the signer of this CFA, I have supervisory authority over the CSPP and have knowledge of the information provided in this CFA. I am familiar with and will ensure that the contractor complies with all applicable program statutes and regulations in effect for FY 2025–26, including but not limited to:
  - Subcontracting requirements, including competitive bidding, CDE approval, and audit requirements in 5 CCR. I certify that any contractual arrangement(s) with subcontractors are made in adherence to the required subcontract provisions contained in the California Education Code (EC), 5 CCR, and the CT&C. As the contractor, it is my responsibility to monitor the performance of the subcontractor to ensure services are provided appropriately through the entire contract term and that the contractor is ultimately responsible for the actions of any subcontractor.
  
  - Prohibitions on conflicts of interests, including (i) the assurances required to establish that transactions with officers, directors and other related party transactions are conducted at arm’s length, and (ii) employment limitations stated in Education Code.
  
  - Cost reimbursement requirements, including reimbursable and non-reimbursable costs, documentation requirements, the provisions for determining the reimbursable amount.

- I understand my obligation as a CSPP contractor to ensure the accuracy of information in CDMIS on an ongoing basis and will update the information in CDMIS as needed throughout the contract period.  

By signing this CFA, the contractor is indicating that it wishes to automatically renew the current contract for FY 2025–26 and, if approved, is willing to, and does accept, all terms and conditions of the CSPP contract, which will be provided to the contractor no later than June 1, 2025.  

The contractor may reject the FY 2025–26 contract by providing the CDE with a written notice of rejection no earlier than June 30, 2025.

Contractors providing such notice to the CDE of the rejection of the terms of the contract(s) will not have a contract(s) in effect for FY 2025–26. I understand that failure to timely reject the terms of the contract means that the contract may be automatically renewed for FY 2025-26 starting on July 1, 2025.  

As the authorized representative of the contractor named in this application, I certify that I have reviewed all the information provided in this application, and in all accompanying forms, and I hereby attest that the information provided is true and correct to the best of my knowledge as of the date this certification is signed.

**CONTRACTOR CERTIFICATION CLAUSES**

1. **STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE:** Contractor has, unless exempted, complied with the nondiscrimination program requirements. (Gov. Code §12990 (a-f) and CCR, Title 2, Section 11102) (Not applicable to public entities.)

2. **DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE REQUIREMENTS:** Contractor will comply with the requirements of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1990 and will provide a drug-free workplace by taking the following actions:

   a. Publish a statement notifying employees that unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession or use of a controlled substance is prohibited and specifying actions to be taken against employees for violations.

   b. Establish a Drug-Free Awareness Program to inform employees about:
   
   1) the dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;
   
   2) the person's or organization's policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;
   
   3) any available counseling, rehabilitation and employee assistance programs; and,
   
   4) penalties that may be imposed upon employees for drug abuse violations.

   c. Every employee who works on the proposed Agreement will:
   
   1) receive a copy of the company's drug-free workplace policy statement; and,
<!-- Page 137 -->
2) agree to abide by the terms of the company's statement as a condition of employment on the Agreement.

Failure to comply with these requirements may result in suspension of payments under the Agreement or termination of the Agreement or both and Contractor may be ineligible for award of any future State agreements if the department determines that any of the following has occurred: the Contractor has made false certification, or violated the certification by failing to carry out the requirements as noted above. (Gov. Code §8350 et seq.)

3. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD CERTIFICATION: Contractor certifies that no more than one (1) final unappealable finding of contempt of court by a Federal court has been issued against Contractor within the immediately preceding two-year period because of Contractor's failure to comply with an order of a Federal court, which orders Contractor to comply with an order of the National Labor Relations Board. (Pub. Contract Code §10296) (Not applicable to public entities.)

4. CONTRACTS FOR LEGAL SERVICES $50,000 OR MORE- PRO BONO REQUIREMENT: Contractor hereby certifies that Contractor will comply with the requirements of Section 6072 of the Business and Professions Code, effective January 1, 2003.

If Contractor has any questions on the status of any person rendering services or involved with the Agreement, the awarding agency must be contacted immediately for clarification.

Current State Employees (Pub. Contract Code §10410):

1). No officer or employee shall engage in any employment, activity or enterprise from which the officer or employee receives compensation or has a financial interest and which is sponsored or funded by any state agency, unless the employment, activity or enterprise is required as a condition of regular state employment.

2). No officer or employee shall contract on his or her own behalf as an independent contractor with any state agency to provide goods or services.

2). For the twelve-month period from the date he or she left state employment, no former state officer or employee may enter into a contract with any state agency if he or she was employed by that state agency in a policy-making position in the same general subject area as the proposed contract within the 12-month period prior to his or her leaving state service.

If Contractor violates any provisions of above paragraphs, such action by Contractor shall render this Agreement void. (Pub. Contract Code §10420)

Upon receipt of legal documentation of the name change the State will process the amendment. Payment of invoices presented with a new name cannot be paid prior to approval of said amendment.

5. CORPORATE QUALIFICATIONS TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA:

a. When agreements are to be performed in the state by corporations, the contracting agencies will be verifying that the contractor is currently qualified to do business in California in order to ensure that all obligations due to the state are fulfilled.

b. "Doing business" is defined in R&TC Section 23101 as actively engaging in any transaction for the purpose of financial or pecuniary gain or profit. Although there are some statutory exceptions to taxation, rarely will a corporate contractor performing within the state not be subject to the franchise tax.

c. Both domestic and foreign corporations (those incorporated outside of California) must be in good standing in order to be qualified to do business in California. Agencies will determine whether a corporation is in good standing by calling the Office of the Secretary of State.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## BOARD OF EDUCATION  

### AGENDA ITEM: J.1  
### MEETING DATE: 11/19/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Universal Prekindergarten (UPK) Update (Townsend-Snider) - 7:20 p.m.  

**DEPARTMENT:** Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Report: The superintendent is recommending that the board receive an update regarding the current progress for Universal Prekindergarten (UPK) in alignment with state legislation.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The purpose of this report is to update the board on UPK implementation and planning, which includes the expansion of services for 4-year-old students in transitional kindergarten (TK). The final year of UPK's gradual implementation in California will be the 2025-26 school year. By this time, the program goal is to offer TK to all four-year-old children. The intent of UPK planning (through legislation) rests on five focus areas and recommends that all school districts form collaborative teams inclusive of multiple departments, labor partners, and school community members.  

Currently, there are 37 TK classes, with seven added at the beginning of the 2024-25 school year. Our district will continue to expand TK classes through a phased approach, by adding additional classrooms through the 2025-26 school year when students who turn age four by September 1st will be eligible for TK. Newly added TK classrooms' schedules mirror the school kindergarten schedules to provide continuity and consistency in the early learning classrooms.  

The UPK grant allocation is a one-time allocation intended to support school districts with the implementation process. As a part of supporting the UPK plan, the district is broadening funding sources from programs such as Expanded Learning Opportunity Programs (ELO-P) and the Work Force Development Grant in partnership with the Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE). The Work Force Development Grant is a program that supports the development of TK teachers while ELO-P funding supports opportunities for students to access an expanded school day through various programs. UPK implementation will continue to thrive as staff and community work together in service of TK students.

**SUBJECT:** Dress Code Implementation Report (Schnepp) - 7:40 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Teaching and Learning  
**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Report: The superintendent is recommending that the board hear a report on the implementation of the districtwide dress code.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
During the 2023-24 school year, the district engaged in creating a robust process to develop a districtwide dress code. At the June 11, 2024, board of education meeting, the Dress Code Advisory Team presented the revised districtwide dress code to the board to be implemented for the 2024-2025 school year.

As part of the implementation plan in June 2024, a robust communication plan was developed to inform and support schools, students, staff, and the community with the dress code. The communication plan included outreach through a variety of platforms including email, websites, committee meetings, district communication tools such as Talking Points, social media platforms, etc.

To support the implementation of the dress code, districtwide training occurred in August 2024 during staff professional development days before the start of school. Certificated and classified staff received information and training on the dress code, which included a lesson plan with a script.

In October 2024, a districtwide survey was developed and sent to students, staff, and community members to gather feedback. 1,739 people completed the survey. Included in this presentation are the major themes and trends that surfaced from the survey, current data on dress code violations, and next steps to refine and support the implementation of the districtwide dress code.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## DRESS CODE  

In alignment with San Juan Unified’s Strategic Plan and to support our 8 Point Commitment to Educational Justice this dress code applies to all schools. Schools may not enact more restrictive or less restrictive dress and grooming expectations or modify this code in any way.  

### Dress Code Core Values  
Students have the right to:  
- Be treated fairly without discrimination (BP 5132)  
- Dress comfortably for an active school day  
- Feel good about their bodies  

### Dress Code Purpose  
- Maintain a safe learning environment where students can choose their clothing, except in classes where special clothes or shoes are needed or required, such as science (eye or body protection) or PE (athletic attire/shoes)  
- Ensure students can participate in all activities with minimal dress code interruptions  

### Key Principles  
The primary responsibility for a student's attire resides with the student and their parent(s) or guardian(s). In addition, the school is responsible for supporting the health and safety of all students.  

1. Students MUST wear the following:  
   A. A non-see-through shirt with straps that cover the front, back, and sides including the rib cage  
   B. A non-see-through bottom like a skirt, jeans, pants, leggings, dress, or shorts that cover the buttocks while sitting and standing  
   C. Shoes (elementary students must wear shoes with a heel strap)  

2. Students MAY wear, as long as these items do not violate Section 1 above:  
   A. Hats, sweatshirt hoods, durags, beanies, wave caps, and religious headwear may be worn, but the face must remain visible to staff  
   B. Fitted pants, including leggings and yoga pants  
   C. Ripped jeans (as long as underwear and buttocks are not showing)  
   D. Tank tops, including spaghetti straps, halter tops, and midriff-baring shirts  
   E. Athletic attire  
   F. Sweatpants/Pajama bottoms  
<!-- Page 174 -->
G. Visible waistbands or visible straps on undergarments  
H. Sun-protective clothing like hats for outdoor use during school  
I. Clothing with brand logos, sports team logos, or images is allowed as long as it doesn’t violate section 3 below  

3. Students CAN NOT wear clothing, jewelry, or personal items that:  
A. Depict items with violent images or language  
B. Display items with images or language about drugs, alcohol, tobacco, vaping, or illegal activities  
C. Display profanity, pornography, or promote illegal or violent conduct  
D. Promote hate groups or target specific groups based on race, religion, ethnicity, gender, or sexual identity  
E. Display or promote hate speech:  
   a. Hate speech is any form of expression where people try to insult, humiliate, or encourage hatred against a group of people based on their race, religion, skin color, sexual identity, gender identity, ethnicity, disability, or national origin  
F. Are swimsuits, except when worn for PE or sports  
G. Could be considered dangerous or could be used as a weapon  
H. Cover the face (unless for religious, cultural, or medical reasons)  
I. Show gang affiliation  

Special Events: All special events guidelines (such as dances, sporting events, senior events, graduations, spirit days, field trips, etc) will be updated to match this dress code.

# Addressing Dress Code Non-Compliance

If a student does not follow this code, consequences can include parent/guardian contact, a meeting, or being told to cover up, change, or remove the clothing that breaks the rules. The principal or their designee will notify a student’s parent/guardian about the school’s response to dress code violations.

If a student is non-compliant with the dress code, the following can occur:
1. The loss of class time will be kept to a minimum and students will receive a non-verbal dress code slip to go to the office to address the non-compliance.
2. The non-verbal slip is used to preserve student dignity and avoid public shaming.
3. Students will be asked to choose one of the below options:
   a. Put on their own alternative clothing if already available at school  
   b. Turn the garment inside out  
   c. Put on a sweatshirt or jacket zipped up  
   d. Voluntarily wear temporary school clothing for either the remainder of the day or until alternate clothing can be dropped off.  
   e. Call parents/guardians to bring alternative clothing.  
      i. If parents/guardians are called, students will return to class using one of the temporary alternative options above until their replacement garments arrive.

No grade of a student participating in a physical education class shall be adversely affected if the student does not wear standardized physical education apparel because of circumstances beyond the student's control. (Education Code section 49066)

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT**  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**AGENDA ITEM:** J.3  
**MEETING DATE:** 11/19/2024  

**SUBJECT:** 2024-25 Meal Price Increases (Camarda) - 7:55 p.m.  

**DEPARTMENT:** Operations  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the proposed price increase of paid adult and student second meals for the 2024-25 school year.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Second meals to students are not eligible for reimbursement and must follow a pricing formula. Prices must be reviewed annually. An adult meal must be priced to cover all the costs to produce that meal. Meals served to non-students cannot be subsidized by Federal or State reimbursements, student payments, other nonprofit food service revenues, or USDA Foods.  

The last paid and second meal price increase was approved by the board on 09/13/2022. Between the 2022-23 and 2023-24 school years, labor costs have increased by 13%, with an additional increase in 2024-25 by another 13% for Nutrition Service Workers. Food and supplies have also increased by approximately 20%. Supplies increase includes, but is not limited to, using compostable cutleries and packaging which are procured at a much higher price. Nutrition Services is requesting the price for a student second meal be increased to $3.80 per breakfast and $5.50 per lunch. Consequently, adult meals prices will be increased to $5.10 for breakfast and $7.00 for lunch. The summary of current and proposed pricing can be found on attachment 1.

# STUDENT SECOND MEAL AND ADULT MEAL PRICING - 2024-25

## Pricing of Adult Meal
The National School Lunch Act of 1946 and Child Nutrition Act of 1966 aim to safeguard the health and well-being of the country’s children. For those participating schools and institutions which claim reimbursement in the NSLP and SBP, federal assistance is intended to meet the nutritional needs of children. Conversely, program meals served to adults are not eligible for cash reimbursement under authorizing federal legislation and regulations. School food authorities (SFA) must ensure that the federal reimbursements, children’s payments, and other food service revenues (i.e., state reimbursement), and USDA Foods do not subsidize program meals served to adults. USDA FNS instructions stipulate that the price of an adult meal must fully cover all costs incurred in the production of the meal, including USDA Food fair market value.

A student second meal and an adult meal is classified as a non-program food and must be a priced meal.

## Why a Price Increase:
- Last paid and second meal price increase was made in the 2022-23 school year (Prices should be reviewed annually)
- Increased salary and benefit costs
- Increased food and supplies costs
- Current meal prices are not compliant in accordance with the USDA Non-program Revenue Calculator

## Comparative Cost Difference between 2022-23 and 2023-24
**Labor (Salaries and Benefits)** approximate increase of 13% (Additional FTEs that had been funded by ESSER funds absorbed under FD 13 in 2023-24)  
There will also be additional increase in salaries by 13% for NSW's in 2024-25.

**Food and supplies** approximate increase of 20%. Supplies increase includes, but is not limited to, using compostable cutleries and packaging which are procured at a much higher price.

## Pricing Student Second Breakfasts and Lunches:
The 2024-25 Federal and CA State Universal Meal Program reimbursement rates are being used to determine student second meal prices:
- Breakfast = $3.819 round down to $3.80
- Lunch = $5.519 round down to $5.50

## Non-Program Foods
Title 7 CFR, Section 210.14(f) defines non-program foods as food and beverages that are:
1. Sold at a participating school other than a reimbursable program meal, and;
2. Purchased using funds from the SFA’s non-profit school food service account (otherwise known as the cafeteria fund).

Per FNS instruction 782-5 Rev. 1 – “Since the expressed purpose of federal assistance is to safeguard the health and well-being of the nation’s children, meals served to adults are neither eligible under the authorizing legislation and regulations for the federal cash reimbursement, nor do they earn donated food assistance for the school food authority.”

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT**  
**AGENDA ITEM:** J.4  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**MEETING DATE:** 11/19/2024  

**SUBJECT:** 2025-2026 Legislative Principles and Priorities (Thigpen) - 8:05 p.m.  

**DEPARTMENT:** Labor Relations and Government Affairs  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Discussion/Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board discuss and adopt the 2025-2026 Legislative Principles and Priorities.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The San Juan Unified School District values strong partnerships with state, local and federal government decision-makers. The goal of the district’s government affairs program is to inform and shape policy and fiscal decisions that address our district mission: setting high expectations for academic achievement rooted in equity and unity, and creating supportive learning experiences in which all students, families and staff can excel and thrive.  

On Sept. 24, 2024, the board adopted a new policy (BP 1160: Political Practices) that affirms the board’s authority, via the superintendent or designee, to engage in advocacy at the local, state, and federal levels. The policy requires the board to adopt overarching legislative priorities before each two-year legislative session, which are aligned with the district’s strategic plan and are intended to define focus areas for staff’s advocacy work, such as determining whether to take on or communicate a formal position on pending legislation.  

The draft principles and priorities presented to the board are intended to define focus areas that will guide the district’s advocacy efforts during the 2025-2026 state legislative session. These draft priorities are not intended to propose or advance specific policy; rather, each represents one of five high-level focus areas that will provide staff the guidance and flexibility needed to engage on a broad range of legislative, fiscal, and regulatory matters that may arise during the next session.

# 2025-26 Legislative Principles and Priorities

## Introduction
The San Juan Unified School District values strong partnerships with state, local and federal government decision-makers. Together, we can inform and shape policy and fiscal decisions that address our shared interests: setting high expectations for academic achievement rooted in equity and unity, and creating supportive learning experiences in which all students, families and staff can excel and thrive.

As one of the top 10 largest school districts in California, San Juan Unified serves the diverse needs of more than 39,000 TK-adult learners across 68 schools in the capital region, and nearly 61% of our students are identified as low-income, English Learner, and/or in the foster care system. The principles and priorities outlined below are aligned with the district’s five-year strategic plan and are intended to define focus areas that will guide the district’s advocacy efforts during the 2025-26 state legislative session.

These priorities are not intended to propose or advance specific policy; rather, each represents one of five high-level focus areas that will provide staff the guidance and flexibility needed to engage on a broad range of legislative, fiscal, and regulatory matters that may arise.

## Guiding Principles
The four directions found in the district’s 2024-29 strategic plan, developed through extensive community input, serve as the guiding principles for all San Juan Unified advocacy efforts and the development of legislative priority areas (pages 2-3):

1. **Advance and Support Student Success:** Deliver high quality, equitable and supportive academic instruction and social-emotional learning for every student in preparation for post-secondary education, career and life.

2. **Prioritize Equitable Practices:** Integrate our commitment to educational justice throughout San Juan Unified by ensuring all students, families and staff members have fair access, opportunity and resources to learn, grow and thrive regardless of background, identity or ability.

3. **Enhance Employee Systems and Supports:** Innovate and strengthen systems to prioritize employee wellness and cultivate a thriving workforce.

4. **Engage Students, Families, and Community as Valued Educational Partners:** Expand meaningful engagement opportunities with students, families and community members to amplify all voices, provide equitable access, and create safe and welcoming environments throughout the district.

# 2025 Legislative Priority Areas

## Accelerate Student Achievement through Adequate, Ongoing Funding
Amid the economic volatility of the post-pandemic recovery, San Juan Unified appreciates the Legislature and governor’s efforts to protect and stabilize funding for public schools. The expiration of one-time funds - more than $300 million in federal and state allocations to San Juan Unified since 2021 - come at a time when new learning supports and strategies are beginning to take root. As schools continue their work to accelerate learning, it is critical they have ongoing resources beyond minimum cost-of-living adjustments under the Local Control Funding Formula. Additionally, new programs or mandates must come with additional funding for implementation.

## Bolster the Education Workforce
School staffing continuity is critical to student achievement, yet an unprecedented personnel shortage - in classroom instruction, among classified support staff and in administration - is a crisis that has dramatically impaired our schools’ ability to sustain, strengthen and diversify its workforce. The district is grateful for the state’s support of incentives, residency programs, and flexibility in credentialing. We urge lawmakers to keep supporting programs that are working and to continue partnering with local educational agencies on additional strategies.

## Create and Enhance Safe, Inspiring Learning Environments
### Facilities:
San Juan Unified has invested heavily in modernizing its schools, enhancing health and safety measures, and creating innovative and inspiring learning centers and community hubs. Yet like many school systems across California, the district’s remaining facilities needs - more than $3 billion - far surpass available funding. San Juan Unified will support efforts that allow the district to maximize available funding, avoid or eliminate barriers to projects, and better position its schools to meet the demands of expanding access to priority initiatives such as school meals, early education opportunities, and college and career readiness programs.

### Physical and Emotional Safety:
The physical and emotional safety of students is paramount to their success at school. San Juan Unified encourages continued focus on investments and policy that will sustain and strengthen ongoing efforts to address student wellbeing and the complex and intensifying behavioral and mental health needs of our students. Additionally, it is important that fiscal and policy proposals help school systems maintain and, where necessary, grow crucial physical safety investments, including the personnel who provide additional student supervision and social emotional support, cybersecurity, and building security enhancements.

# Ensure Success of Growing Educational Programs

**Early learning:** San Juan Unified is committed to providing all families with the high-quality options for early learning their children need to set them on a path to lifelong success. The following will be critical to ensuring sustainable access for every child: continued investment in pre-kindergarten and transitional kindergarten programs; policies that support the growth and success of the early educator workforce; and resources and flexibility to support the implementation of staffing and facilities requirements.

**College and career readiness:** San Juan Unified applauds the governor and Legislature for their ongoing support for programs such as Career Technical Education (CTE) and dual enrollment, as well as efforts to strengthen coherence among programs, which is needed for students to thrive in the post-graduate pathways they choose. The district encourages continued focus in these areas as it grows its offerings and supports efforts to increase flexibility and remove barriers - or avoid unintended barriers - to student access.

# Meet Evolving Student Needs

**Newcomer students:** San Juan Unified continues to welcome hundreds of newcomer students into its classrooms; since the 2021-22 school year, the number of newcomers enrolled in district schools has increased by nearly 60 percent and continues to rise. Many of these students are refugees - nearly 1,800 in the 2023-24 school year alone. San Juan Unified supports efforts to examine the fiscal and policy implications of helping schools create safe, stable and successful transitions for newcomer students and families.

**Special Education:** Additionally, San Juan Unified educators and staff continue to create opportunities for students with disabilities to excel and thrive as enrollment grows and individual student needs become more acute. Increased state and federal investments are needed to ensure our schools can continue providing our most vulnerable students with the learning conditions and services they deserve.

- Available grant income (received grants not expended) of $510,447.  
- The FY 2024-2025 Budget results in a net decrease in the Reserves of $262,925  
- Investment into the Police Department is projected to be $296,000. This investment

may increase by $100,000 for the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department (SCSD) that cover a broad array of services including use of their systems for radio, dispatch, record keeping, and property evidence room as FEC does not have the capabilities or department structure to have these services in-house. Additionally, for the 2024-2025 year Mission Oaks RPD and North Highlands RPD have terminated their contracts effective Jun 30, 2024. Mission Oaks and North Highland contracts accounted for 35 percent of the Police Department revenues.

GM Ballus stated the staff is excited about this budget as there are three received grants ready for implementation, and the District’s reserve funds have exceeded $1 million. Staff is requesting investments in capital improvement and equipment projects including a new service truck for maintenance and playgrounds facilities upgrades to make an immediate impact.

Vice Chair Lavallee asked if staff has had the opportunity to reach out to other RPDs regarding any salary step increases and COLA increases policies. Director Lavallee indicated she recommends having a policy that addresses why and when step and COLA increases are provided to staff.

GM Ballus indicated the District currently has five steps and this projected step increase will not impact steps overall. Preliminary discussions in the Personnel and Finance Committee considered eliminating step 1, and subsequently moving step 2 to step 1, and then adding a new step 5, but that discussion was not moved out of committee for the full Board’s consideration.

GM Ballus indicated that peer RPDs use a combination of step and COLA increases, but that, to date, staff have not received other districts’ policies that indicate when steps and COLA are to be awarded.

Public Comment:  
No public comments made.

Recommendation:  
Chair Dias called for a motion to approve the FY 2024-2025 budgets. Vice Chair made the motion to approve the FY 2024-2025 budget and the accompanying four resolutions for funds 342A, 396A, and 396B and the Gann Appropriations Limit. Director Higgins seconded the motion. The motion and resolutions passed with a vote of 5-0-0-0.

5.2 Access Between SJUSD Cottage Elementary School and FEC Cottage Park  
Staff Report  
GM Ballus reported that Secretary Seaman has requested staff work with Cottage Elementary to have the gate between Cottage Elementary and Cottage Park open to the public to access either site after school hours. Staff met with Cottage Elementary staff to discuss. Cottage Elementary staff recommended that the public have access in the school via the northern side of the school property, as illustrated in the board packet handout, as that corridor is covered by security cameras and the requested gate access is not. Manger Harder reported that he attended an unrelated SJUSD meeting where school staff indicated SJUSD is making a significant investment in fencing around all school sites that will result in having only one way in and out at each school.

GM Ballus requested the Board provide staff direction on how to proceed with the gate request given SJUSD offered an alternate option.
<!-- Page 217 -->
Public Comment:  
No public comments made.  

Recommendation:  
The Board will consider accepting access to Cottage Elementary School from Cottage Park as proposed by SJUSD.  

The Chair polled each director with the Board collectively accepting SJUSD’s option despite misgivings about doing so.  

5.3 Popup Tent Use in FEC Parks  

Staff Report  
GM Ballus reported that resident Tim Castleman requested staff remove park patron pop-up tents from the parks. Mr. Castleman indicated that the tent user is a homeless person and that tents are not allowed in the parks. GM Ballus advised that overnight camping is not allowed in the parks but that there is no park policy or ordinance on tent use during the day.  

GM Ballus asked the Board to provide direction for staff regarding tents in parks during the day.  

Public Comment:  
No public comments made.  

Recommendation:  
The Board discussed the popup tents and use in the parks. Currently, policy does not prevent daytime usage of tents.  

The Board requested staff collect information on what other park districts may mandate for tent usage.  

The Board recognized that this could turn into a bigger issue and the need for a policy on tent usage may be needed.  

Secretary Seaman reported that Sheriff’s Department has a Homeless Operation Team (HOT Team). Staff would need to submit a letter to the Sheriff’s Department giving them permission to manage any homelessness park issues. He indicated that school districts already employ these letters for assistance. GM Ballus is already in the process of generating the letter to the Sheriff’s Department to handle homeless encampments.  

The Board directed staff to respond to Mr. Casselman and advise him that the board is now aware of the issue, are researching options, and to refer him to the HOT Team as an additional resource.  

5.4 San Juan Unified School District and Fulton-El Camino Recreation and Park District Park and Trail Easement at Katharine Johnson Middle School  

Staff Report  
GM Ballus reported that the easement at Katherine Johnson Middle School for access to Creekside Nature Area presented in April 2023 is being submitted again for board approval.  
<!-- Page 218 -->
GM Ballus met with the SJUSD on board member requests to have a public meeting on the easement and to meet with the SJUSD school board. The school board is not inclined to hold a public meeting on the proposed easement or have shared board meetings to discuss the easement.

GM Ballus recommended the Board approve the easement as presented.

**Public Comment:**
No public comments made.

**Recommendation:**
Chair Dias asked if Directors had any clarifying questions or comments.
- Director Higgins asked about the existing fence, and will it be removed? GM Ballus stated that we do not want to take down the existing fence as it serves as border/barrier between the easement and the adjacent residents’ backyards.
- Director Stricklin asked about the easement and whether it is wide enough for emergency vehicles. GM showed the Board where the emergency vehicles would access the area on the map, which is not along the easement but from Kent Lane.
- Secretary Seaman objected to the SJUSD not having a public meeting for the easement.

Vice Chair Lavallee made the motion to accept the proposed easement of 15 feet offered by the School District and requested GM Ballus get complete easement details to share with the public in a public meeting. Chair Dias seconded the motion. The motion passed with the vote of 4-0-0-1, with Secretary Seaman abstaining.

6. **GENERAL ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION** (No Action Required)

6.1 **General Manager’s Report**
Please refer to the GM Ballus report which was provided under a separate cover.

GM Ballus provided an overview of the financial results from 2023-2024 stating that recreation, PD, and facilities rentals all exceeded revenue projections, and property taxes received were higher than projected. As a result, the combined fund balance now exceeds $1.2 million.

GM Ballus shared photos of the increased trash left in parks that the maintenance staff must remove.

Manager Harder reported on the Blue Heron Program partnership which provides and pays companies to have people with developmental disabilities as employees. FEC now has three Blue Heron staff members paid for by Blue Heron.

This tentative agreement was ratified by the Teamsters Local No. 150 on Nov. 8, 2024. Bargaining timelines outlined in the Teamsters collective bargaining agreement (Article 1.2.2) will resume in spring 2025.

![MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) BETWEEN SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT (District) AND TEAMSTERS LOCAL No. 150 (Teamsters) CREATION OF A VAN DRIVER PROGRAM Updated Oct. 25, 2024](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=MEMORANDUM+OF+UNDERSTANDING+(MOU)+BETWEEN+SAN+JUAN+UNIFIED+SCHOOL+DISTRICT+(District)+AND+TEAMSTERS+LOCAL+No.+150+(Teamsters)+CREATION+OF+A+VAN+DRIVER+PROGRAM+Updated+Oct.+25,+2024)

This Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") is between the Teamsters Local No. 150 ("Teamsters") and San Juan Unified School District ("District") regarding the creation of a van driver program. The parties have met and agreed to the following:

**Background:**
During this time of unprecedented driver shortages there is a need to be innovative and provide solutions to meeting the transportation needs of our special education students. The District also has a need to develop and foster an ongoing pipeline of prospective drivers so that it can reduce vacancies and be less reliant on outside vendors to provide services.

After a successful pilot year, the District is recommending the continuation of a van driver program that will provide more flexibility in hiring drivers in a capacity that does not require specific pupil licensing requirements.

**Intent:**
It is the intent of this MOU to outline the conditions under which the District will continue its van driver program through December 31, 2024.

**Agreement:**
The District and Teamsters agree to the following terms:
1. The District will continue the program with a minimum of five (5.0) FTE up to ten (10) FTE District Van Driver positions.
   a. Any addition beyond five (5) District Van Driver positions during the term of this agreement must be made by mutual agreement between the District and the Teamsters.
   b. The District may staff a combination of temporary Van Driver positions and permanent Van Driver positions, up to ten (10) total FTE.
      c. When there are vacancies in Van Driver positions, the District may temporarily assign Bus Drivers or contractors to drive a van until the position is filled.
2. **Temporary Van Drivers:** Qualified employees enrolled in the District bus driver academy obtaining a Class B school bus driver certification may be assigned to this temporary position for a period of six (6) months from the date of obtaining a Class B permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles.
   a. Any extension beyond six (6) months will be made only by mutual agreement between the Teamsters and District.
3. The District Van Driver shall be placed at Salary Range 22 of the Transportation Unit Salary Schedule.
   a. New hires begin at Step 2.
4. The District and the Teamsters agree that the van driver program will be entered into supplement, not supplant, the work of current District school bus drivers.
5. The District and the Teamsters agree that van drivers shall not displace current employees.
<!-- Page 227 -->
6. The District and the Teamsters agree that current employees' schedules will not be reduced as a result of implementing a van driver program.

7. During the length term of this MOU, the District will continue to faithfully attempt to hire and fill vacant school bus driver positions.

8. The District and the Teamsters agree that van drivers cannot be assigned to a route that is maintained at eight (8) hours per day pursuant to Article 5.2. In addition, the District will maintain a minimum of 40 8-hour drivers during the term of this agreement.

**Length Term of Agreement:**

1. The Teamsters and the District agree that this MOU will remain in effect so long as sixty percent (60%) of the total number of district bus routes are maintained at eight (8) hours per day (aka, “8-hour guarantee”), per Article 5.2 of the collective bargaining agreement. Should the 8-hour guarantee in Article 5.2 be reduced in percentage, this MOU shall expire within six (6) months of the effective date of the reduction, unless revised and/or extended by mutual agreement between the District and Teamsters, through December 31, 2024. This MOU may be revised and/or extended by mutual agreement between the District and Teamsters.

2. The parties agree to negotiate the terms of this agreement during the next scheduled round of successor contract bargaining. Items to be negotiated will include but are not limited to reviewing the impacts and effectiveness of the program, the option to make the program permanent, expanding the program, or making other modifications. This MOU may be revised and/or extended by mutual agreement between the District and Teamsters.

**Length of Term of Agreement:**
The Teamsters and the District agree that this MOU will remain in effect so long as sixty percent (60%) of the total number of district bus routes are maintained at eight (8) hours per day (aka, “8-hour guarantee”), per Article 5.2 of the collective bargaining agreement.

**CREATION OF A DELEGATED BEHIND-THE-WHEEL TRAINING PROGRAM**

**Updated July 30, 2024**

**Background:**  
There is a national shortage of Delegated Behind-The-Wheel Trainers and correspondingly the District has been experiencing similar significant shortages of Delegated Behind-The-Wheel Trainers and school bus drivers.

AGENDA ITEM: J.8  
MEETING DATE: 11/19/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Adjustments to Superintendent’s Cabinet Salary Schedule and Contracts (Gaddis) - 8:30 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Legal Services  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the 2024-25 and 2025-26 adjustments to the Superintendent’s Cabinet Salary Schedule and ratify the amendments to reflect the salary schedule adjustments.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The proposed Superintendent’s Cabinet Salary Schedule adjustments before the board were developed using a targeted approach that examined the responsibilities and compensation of comparable roles in the workforce. This is a similar approach the district took with its labor partners during the bargaining cycle that concluded at the end of 2023-24, when settlements resulted in strategic, equitable investments in specific job classifications or salary schedule ranges to address shared recruitment and retention interests. Additionally, the total value of the proposed salary schedule adjustments does not exceed the value of any of the two-year agreements reached with district bargaining units or unrepresented groups.  

**ATTACHMENT(S):**

2. Cabinet Salary Schedule 25-26
