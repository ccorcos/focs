### AGENDA ITEM: G-5  
### MEETING DATE: 04/23/2024  

**SUBJECT:** San Juan Choices Charter School On-Going Salary Schedule Adjustment  

**DEPARTMENT:** Admissions and Family Services  

**CHECK ONE:**  
For Discussion: ☐  
For Action: ☑  
Report: ☐  
Workshop: ☐  
Recognition: ☐  
Emergency Action: ☐

### ACTION REQUESTED:  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the salary schedule adjustment for San Juan Choices Charter School. The adjustments for CCS are as follows:  
- All base salaries shall be increased by a total of 10.0%, effective July 1, 2023.  

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:  
San Juan Choices Charter School (CCS) attempts to, when fiscally possible, match the raises and bonuses the district provides to its own employees. On October 11, 2022, the board approved a salary schedule increase of 10% for the San Juan Teachers Association retroactive to July 1, 2022. Other bargaining groups within the district were also given a 10% salary increase. Because of the timing of the district’s approval and due to a leadership change at CCS, the school was unable to make this request to the board before the end of the 2022-2023 fiscal year.  

CCS anticipates a stable enrollment pattern and moderate growth over the next three years which will ensure healthy financial reserves that will support quality programs and services while honoring the hard work of teachers and staff by providing competitive salaries.

Welcoming schools that support the social and emotional needs of our students form the foundation for academic excellence. We recognize this is built through continuous improvement of intentional collaborative efforts that are focused on the following:

1. **Connected School Communities:** Caring staff actively build community relationships, identify assets and needs and connect students and families with resources to help them access the best opportunities our schools have to offer.
2. **Healthy Environments for Social-Emotional Growth:** Staff will cultivate inclusive, safe, equitable, and culturally responsive and healthy environments by integration of social and emotional learning to ensure essential student development.
3. **Engaging Academic Programs:** Staff educators will engage and support each student in a challenging and broad course of study that builds skills, knowledge and experiences preparing all to be critical thinkers who communicate effectively, collaborate and are civic-minded.
4. **Clear Pathways to Bright Futures:** Our whole school community engages each student in discovering their limitless potential, and through coordinated efforts, prepares them for college, career and bright futures filled with opportunities.

# District Overview

Created in 1960 with the merger of six school districts, San Juan Unified School District has a rich tradition in providing all students with the opportunity for academic success and achievement.

The district serves a 75-square-mile area covering the communities of Arden-Arcade, Carmichael, Citrus Heights, Fair Oaks, Gold River and Orangevale.

Today, San Juan Unified is the 10th largest school district in California with an expenditure budget of more than $500 million used to employ more than 5,000 individuals and to educate more than 45,000 students in our early learning, TK-12 and adult programs. More than 10,000 additional K-12 students are served in independent charter schools within the district.

The district consists of 33 elementary schools, eight K-8 schools, nine middle schools, nine comprehensive high schools, three special-education centers, three alternative schools, one adult-education center, two Early Childhood Education centers and one dependent charter.

The student population is diverse. During the 2021-2022-2022-2023 school year, the district’s ethnic/racial makeup was: 0.5-5 percent American Indian or Alaskan Native, 25.9-7 percent Hispanic/Latino, 7.16-9 percent African American, 47.647 percent White, 9.810.6 percent Asian/Asian American, 0.7 percent Pacific Islander, .9 percent Filipino and 7.4-6 percent multi-race.

# Roles and responsibilities of board members and the superintendent

## Board Roles

The role of the board is to provide each student with an education of the highest possible quality within the limits of financial support provided by the State of California. To accomplish this, board members are responsible for five roles identified by the California School Boards Association (CSBA):

- **Setting the direction** for the district by involving parents/guardians, community, students and staff, while focusing on student learning and achievement.

- **Establishing an effective and efficient structure** by employing the superintendent, developing and adopting policies, establishing budget priorities and adopting the budget, providing safe and adequate facilities to support student learning, and setting parameters for negotiations with employee organizations and ratifying collective bargaining agreements.

- **Providing support to the superintendent and staff** by following standards of responsible governance, making decisions and providing resources that support district priorities and goals, upholding board policies and being effective spokespersons by being knowledgeable about district programs and goals.

- **Ensuring accountability** through evaluation of the superintendent; monitoring and evaluating policies; serving as a judicial and appeals body; monitoring student achievement and program effectiveness; approving, monitoring and adjusting district budgets; and monitoring the collective bargaining process.

- **Providing community leadership and advocacy** on behalf of students, the district’s educational program, and public education in order to build support within the local school community and at the state and national levels.

## Superintendent Roles

CSBA identifies the following standards and roles for superintendents working with the Board of Education:

- Promotes the success of all students and supports the efforts of the board to focus on student learning and achievement.

- Values, advocates and supports public education and all stakeholders.

- Recognizes and respects the different perspectives and styles of board members, staff, students, parents and community, ensuring the diverse range of views inform board decisions.

- Acts with dignity, treats everyone with civility and respect, and understands the implications of demeanor and behavior.

- Serves as a model for the value of lifelong learning and supports the board’s continuous professional development.

- Works with the board as a “governance team” and assures collective responsibility for building a unity of purpose, common vision and positive organizational culture.

- Recognizes that the board/superintendent governance relationship is supported by the district’s management team.

- Understands the distinctions between board and staff roles; and respects the roles of the board as the representative of the community.
<!-- Page 29 -->
- Understands that the authority rests with the board as a whole, provides guidance to the board to assist in decision making, and provides leadership based on the direction of the board as a whole.
- Communicates openly with trust and integrity, including providing all board members with equal access to information, and recognizes the importance of both responsive and anticipatory communications.
- Accepts leadership responsibility and accountability for implementing the vision, goals and policies of the district.
<!-- Page 30 -->
![Board Norms](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Board+Norms)

**Board Norms**

The governance team commits to accomplishing these standards and roles through:

- Focusing on all students
- Demonstrating respect
- Creating transparency
- Communicating openly
- Listening actively
- Keeping commitments
- Being collaborative
- Taking the time needed to govern effectively
- Encouraging everyone’s ideas and points of view
- Balancing trustee area representation vs. districtwide responsibility
- Adherence to the Brown Act

**Trustee Areas and Representation**

Board members are elected by the voters within their trustee area but serve the students, families and residents throughout the district’s 75 square mile area. As such, board members should consider the impacts of decisions on all constituents when deliberating and take action in the best interest of the district as a whole rather than their specific trustee area. Unless specific to the election or trustee boundary designation processes, information prepared by staff will not delineate data specifically by trustee areas.

To facilitate strong community connections, board members are encouraged to build relationships with the organizations and residents within their trustee area in the manner they deem most appropriate and effective. As a courtesy, board members engaged in district business with organizations in another trustee area are encouraged to inform the board secretary and the board member representing the area.

**Welcoming new members**

The board president meets with each newly elected member individually to provide a copy of the Governance Handbook, the schedule of meetings, the format for meetings and governance team operations.

The superintendent meets with each newly elected member to provide an overview of the district and to introduce cabinet members and other staff who will be communicating with the board.

District legal counsel will give newly elected members a copy of the Brown Act and inform them they must conform to its requirements immediately upon assuming office and/or at any time where the newly elected is acting on behalf of the district.

The governance team attends the swearing-in ceremony and reception for the newly elected members.

**Annual Organizational Meeting**

The annual organizational meeting will be held within the required 15-day period commencing on the second Friday in December.

At this meeting, the board shall

- Elect a clerk, vice president and president from its members.
- Establish the regular school board meeting dates and starting/ending times for the year.
<!-- Page 31 -->
- Appoint representatives to specific organizations and committees and  
- Determine locations of board meetings (Board Bylaws 9320, 9140).

<!-- Page 32 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**Speaking with a common voice**

All public statements in the name of the board are made by the board president or, if appropriate, by the superintendent or superintendent’s designee.

When speaking to community groups, the media or to the public, individual board members have a responsibility to identify personal viewpoints as such and not as the viewpoint of the board.

When a board decision has been reached, all board members shall support that decision until it is amended or rescinded by board action. Any board member who may wish to criticize or oppose any specific board action should do so in an open board meeting.

**Assigning work to staff**

No individual member of the board, by virtue of holding office, shall exercise any administrative responsibility with respect to the schools; nor as an individual, command the services of any employee. Board members are to channel their requests and/or concerns directly to the superintendent (or, if necessary, through the board president).

**Addressing conflict among board members**

Because the governance team norms are designed to create an open, respectful, collaborative culture, members will engage in dialogue while welcoming an open discussion with different points of view. Members will demonstrate an ability to disagree on issues without taking the disagreements personally. Nor using social media or public platforms to showcase disagreements. Members will endeavor to maintain neutral body language and tone during deliberations.

**School visitations/Extracurricular events**

School visitations are encouraged to build understanding of the district’s instructional programs, curriculum and communities. Board members should make appointments with the school principal prior to visiting a campus. The board member should also email the board administrative assistant, so the visit can be placed on the board calendar alerting other members to the visit, as well as the superintendent and the board members who represent that trustee area. This may prevent one school from having numerous visits from different board members during a short period of time. During visits, members should be cautious of interrupting the learning environment.

**Graduations**

Graduation ceremonies honor the accomplishments of students and the contributions of their families, teachers and staff and other supporters. Each board member participates in the ceremony of the comprehensive high school(s) within their trustee area by certifying the class. Board members participate in the ceremonies of non-comprehensive high schools on a rotating basis.
<!-- Page 33 -->
# Board Meetings

## Board meeting materials
Board members will be provided with agendas and copies of all related backup materials for regular meetings at least 72 hours in advance and for special meetings at least 24 hours in advance. Members are responsible to review all materials prior to the meeting to assist with an efficient and effective deliberative process.

To provide greater access and transparency to materials, the district is adopting a digital materials management platform. Upon request to the board assistant, members will be provided with devices, training, and/or assistance to access materials.

## Placing items on board agendas
Board members may request that matters be added to meeting agendas during the future agenda discussion, which occurs during each regularly scheduled meeting. If a majority of board members share an interest in the matter, the board president and superintendent shall determine if the topic is within jurisdiction of the board and schedule the item if so. Items that are not within the jurisdiction of the board cannot be agendized. The board president and superintendent may determine if a request is primarily for informational purposes and may fulfill such a request by providing the desired information as appropriate.

## The role of board members during board meetings
The authority to direct action rests solely with the full board during public board meetings. A majority vote provides direction to the superintendent. By carefully reviewing the board packet prior to the board meeting, board members can contact the superintendent for questions about an item. All members share a common responsibility to ensure the Brown Act is followed.

## Individual board member’s request for information, materials or action
It is important for trustees to be well informed, as oversight of the district is one of the main functions of the board. Trustees recognize that they have no power as individuals to direct staff actions, and that compiling information in response to trustee requests can take staff away from their day-to-day operations of schools and the district. An individual board member will – insofar as possible – let the superintendent and staff know ahead of time when a request for information will be made in a public meeting, so the staff can be prepared to provide a thorough response. Staff will make every effort to ensure that board agenda items include thorough background and information. Requests for information not on the board agenda should be made to the superintendent who will ensure the appropriate staff person responds. All information provided by the administration in response to a request by a trustee shall be provided to all other trustees at the same time. Trustees should self-regulate the number of requests for information regarding issues not on the board agenda.

## Board meeting guidelines
It is important to recognize that a board meeting is the time for the board to do their work in public view. We agree to keep our focus on the best interest of our students at all times. After staff input and public comment, board members are encouraged to ask questions and explain their thinking related to the topic at hand. The board president recognizes members who desire to speak, alternating, so that all members have the opportunity to speak. There is not a time limit or limit to the number of questions or comments that a board member may make, but each board member should be respectful of giving other members the
<!-- Page 34 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Image+not+displayed)

**Opportunity to Speak**
Nothing in this section will preclude members from speaking multiple times until all discussion is concluded.

Unless a point is important to further understanding of the immediate discussion, the board president will allow all other members to speak first and then add their comments or questions.

The rules contained in Appendix A, “San Juan Unified Rules of Order,” shall govern operations of board meetings unless they are in conflict with this handbook, board bylaws, or state or federal law. Where there is a conflict of the same, state then federal law supersedes existing regulations and policies.

**Public Comments**
Members of the public shall have an opportunity to address the board on any item of interest that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board (Education Code section 35145.4, Government Code section 54954.3). If the public comments on items not appearing on the posted board agenda, the board cannot take action or discuss the comments (Government Code section 54954.2), other than to briefly acknowledge the comments and, if desired, to ask staff for follow-up information.

**Voting**
A majority vote of all members of the board is necessary for the election of officers or for any other action by the board unless otherwise specified by law. Voting shall be by voice and the board administrative assistant records the votes by member, which is placed into the minutes of the meeting. Where a board member cannot participate, audibly in the vote, they may submit their vote in writing during the public meeting.

Unless otherwise provided by law, affirmative votes by a majority of the board’s membership are required to approve any action under consideration as allowable by quorum, regardless of the number of members present.

The board shall take no action outside of a public meeting except on those matters and under those conditions authorized for closed sessions (Government Code sections 54957, 54957.7; Board Bylaw 9323.2).

**Voting No or Abstaining**
Each trustee respects the right of other trustees to vote “no” on an issue. Everyone agrees it is a courtesy to the governance team to explain the reasons for the “no” vote, either during deliberation or before casting the vote.

A member may abstain from voting for any reason by announcing their abstention when a vote is called. Similar to a no vote, it is a courtesy to the governance team to explain the reason(s) for abstaining from a vote. If a member was absent at the previous meeting, it is customary to abstain from voting on the approval of that meeting’s minutes.

A member must recuse themselves from a vote if any of the following are true: 1) the matter directly involves a close relative of the board member (Education Code section 35707); 2) the vote is to replace the board member’s position on the board (Education Code section 35178); or 3) the matter involves a “remote interest(s)” as listed in Government Code section 1091. When any one of these conditions is met, a board member must recuse themselves by announcing their recusal when the topic is first announced for discussion and leaving the dais during the duration of discussion or action on that item.

12
<!-- Page 35 -->
# Quorum

A quorum is the minimum number of voting members who must be present at a properly called board meeting in order to conduct business in the name of the board; and is established when a majority of the board members (at least four of the filled positions) are in attendance (Education Code section 35164, Board Bylaw 9323). 

13
<!-- Page 36 -->
# Additional Board Information

## Board-appointed/board-approved committees

Board members appoint community members to committees as determined in committee bylaws. Newly elected board members will be given the option to appoint their own committee members or continue with the current appointments.

Board members serve as the conduit between a board-appointed/board-approved committee and the board as a whole. Board members are not voting members of board-appointed/board-approved committees.

If a board member wants to attend a board-appointed/board-approved committee meeting of which they are not the board liaison, the board member should contact the board administrative assistant. This will eliminate the possibility of four or more board members being in attendance at the meeting.

## Electronic media

The Board of Trustees will use electronic media (e.g., email and texting) carefully to ensure that there is no violation of the Brown Act (Government Code sections 54950-54962). The Brown Act prohibits a majority of board members from exchanging information outside of a board meeting, or using a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to:
- discuss, deliberate, or take action on an item of business within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board,
- advance or clarify an issue,
- facilitate agreement or compromise or
- advance an ultimate resolution.

The board recognizes that by using “Reply All” in email responses, the email:
- becomes part of the deliberative process,
- creates a public record and
- inhibits opportunity for any other four board members to have a conversation on a topic.

Board members will be aware of, and follow, district policy as it pertains to electronic communication. The district is subject to requests for public documents as provided by the California Public Records Act (Government Code section 6250 et seq.). Public documents include emails, text messages and other correspondence from, and between, board members as well as from, and between, employees and board members, regardless of whether sent or received on district provided or personal devices or accounts.

Board members who engage constituents via social media are responsible for ensuring that opinions expressed are presented as their own and not those of the board and for following all applicable board policies and state and federal laws.

## Complaints from community/staff

When an issue is brought to a board member, the board member will use active listening to hear what the complaint or issue is. Board members need to remain cognizant of their responsibility for judicial review, staff and student confidentiality and due process when talking with the complainant.

Restate what the complainant has said to ensure that you have heard the information correctly. Ask the person what they would like the board member to do with the information and what the individual would like to see as a possible solution. Explain that you will be sharing the information with the superintendent.

---

<!-- Page 37 -->
Redirect the complainant to communicate with appropriate personnel and utilize the appropriate complaint procedure. Ask the individual to follow up if the problem isn’t resolved. Notify the superintendent as soon as possible with details of the complaint.

In order to support a positive working relationship among the San Juan Unified School District Board of Education, the staff, students and the community, we have reviewed and agreed to the norms and protocols outlined in the 2024 Governance Handbook. We shall renew these agreements annually.

Affirmed on this 11th day of April 2023 23rd day of April 2024.

# San Juan Unified Rules of Order
San Juan Unified’s Board of Education and committees that operate under the Brown Act or Greene Acts utilize the following rules to govern operations during meetings of their bodies. District policy including administrative regulations and board policy as well as state and federal laws shall take precedence if in conflict with these rules.

## Amendments and Updates
These rules are based on Rosenberg's Rules of Order (as published by the League of California Cities) designed for municipalities and civic organizations with modifications to meet the specific needs, practices and interests of the district. In connection with updates to the district’s Board Governance Handbook, district staff shall review any updates to Rosenberg’s Rules of Order to consider for adoption. The Board of Education shall approve all proposed changes to these rules before they become effective.

## The Role of the Chair
It is the responsibility of all members to understand the rules of parliamentary procedure, but it is the role of the chair to apply the rules to the operations of the meeting. The chair is supported in this function by staff as appropriate for the meeting body. As the chair has a larger role in the operation of the meeting, it is a courtesy that they offer comment on a matter before the body after other members and should refrain from making or seconding a motion unless convinced other members will not do so at that point in time.

### The Basic Format for an Agenda Item Discussion
A meeting is governed by the agenda and the agenda constitutes the body’s agreed-upon roadmap for the meeting. Each agenda item can be handled by the chair in the following basic format:
1. The chair should announce the agenda item number and subject and then invite the appropriate person(s) to present on the item, including any recommendations they may have.
2. Following the presentation, the chair should open public comment following the body’s public comment procedure. Speaking times for public comment are limited to 2 minutes per speaker. Total time for public speaking on a public item is determined by each body’s bylaws. If the item is a public hearing, the chair must open the public hearing before beginning public comment and close the public hearing upon conclusion of speakers.
3. The chair should ask members of the body if they have questions or comments regarding the item. Members may ask questions of the presenters and other members or offer comments for consideration. The chair should offer questions or comments after other members have had an opportunity. At the discretion of the chair, members may have additional opportunities to offer questions or comments.
4. Upon conclusion of discussion and questions by members, or as appropriate, the chair should invite a motion. The chair should announce the name of the member who makes the motion.
5. The chair should ask for a second to the motion. The chair should announce the name of the member who seconds a motion. All motions require a second.
6. The chair should check to make sure everyone understands the motion. This can be done by:
   a. The chair asking the maker of the motion to repeat it;
   b. The chair can repeat the motion; or
   c. The chair can ask the individual taking minutes to repeat the motion.
7. The chair should then invite discussion on the motion before the body. If no discussion is offered, or after discussion has ended, the chair should announce the body will vote on the motion.
8. The chair takes a vote by asking for the “ayes” and then asking for the “nays.” If members have not yet voted, then the chair should ask for “abstentions.”
9. The chair should announce the result of the vote and the action the body has taken.

## Motions
Motions are the vehicles for decision-making by a body. A member makes a motion by preceding the member’s desired approach with the words, “I move…” The chair usually calls for a motion by inviting members of the body to make a motion, by suggesting a motion that another member then moves or by
<!-- Page 39 -->
# APPENDIX A – RULES OF ORDER

## Types of Motions

**Basic Motion** – The basic motion is one that puts forward a decision for the body’s consideration. A basic motion might be: “I move that we create a five-member committee to plan our event.” A basic motion must have a second to be considered by the body.

**Motion to Amend** – If a member wants to change a basic motion that is before the body, they would move to amend it. A motion to amend might be: “I move that we amend the motion to have a 10-member committee.”

**Substitute Motion** – If a member wants to completely do away with the basic motion that is before the body, and put a new motion before the body, they would move a substitute motion. A substitute motion might be: “I move a substitute motion that we cancel the event this year.” “Motions to amend” and “substitute motions” are often confused, but are quite different, and their effect (if passed) is quite different. A motion to amend seeks to retain the basic motion on the floor but modify it in some way. A substitute motion seeks to throw out the basic motion on the floor and substitute a new and different motion for it. The decision as to whether a motion is really a “motion to amend” or a “substitute motion” is left to the chair. If a member makes what the chair calls a “motion to amend,” but the chair determines that it is really a “substitute motion,” then the chair’s designation governs.

A “friendly amendment” is a practical parliamentary tool that is simple, informal, saves time and avoids bogging a meeting down with numerous formal motions. It works in the following way: In the discussion on a pending motion, it may appear that a change to the motion is desirable or may win support for the motion from some members. When that happens, a member who has the floor may simply say, “I want to suggest a friendly amendment to the motion.” The member suggests the friendly amendment, and if the maker and the person who seconded the motion pending on the floor accept the friendly amendment, that person becomes the seconding motion on the floor. If either the maker or the person who seconded rejects the proposed friendly amendment, the member can formally move to amend.

A “motion to reconsider” is a special and unique motion. Once a vote is taken by a body it is considered final and can only be reopened if a motion to reconsider is made and passed. A motion to reconsider requires a majority vote to pass like other basic motions, but there are two special rules that apply only to motions to reconsider. First, a motion to reconsider must be made at the meeting where the item was first voted upon. (This requirement can be suspended if motion is so and approved by a two-thirds majority.) Second, the motion to reconsider may only be made by certain members of the body. Accordingly, a motion to reconsider may only be made by a member who voted in the majority on the original motion. Any member may second the motion including those who voted in the minority. If the motion to reconsider passes, the original matter is back before the body and the new original motion is in order. The matter may be discussed and debated as if it were on the floor for the first time.

## Multiple Motions Before The Body

There can be up to three motions on the floor at the same time. The chair can reject a fourth motion until the chair has dealt with the three that are on the floor and has resolved them to avoid confusion. All motions must have been moved and seconded to be valid for consideration by the body, this includes basic motions, motions to amend and substitute motions. When there are two or more motions on the floor (which have all been moved and seconded) the subject would proceed first on the last motion that is made. For example, consider that 1) a basic motion is made followed by 2) a motion to amend and then 3) a substitute motion. The chair would first call for discussion and vote on the third motion, the substitute motion. If the substitute motion is approved, it replaces the basic motion and renders the motion to amend invalid and voids it over. If the substitute motion fails, the chair would then call for discussion and vote on the motion to amend. If approved, the amended motion would be considered for vote. If the amendment fails the original motion is then considered.

## Debate on Motions

Most motions are subject to discussion and debate by the body as long as members wish to discuss the item. Discussion remains open until such time that the chair determines it is time to move on and take action. There are exceptions when a motion is not debatable, and a chair must take an immediate vote if the motion is made and receives a second.
<!-- Page 40 -->
![Appendix A - Rules of Order](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Appendix+A+-+Rules+of+Order)

**Motion to adjourn** – This motion, if passed, requires the body to immediately adjourn to its next regularly scheduled meeting. It requires a simple majority vote.  
**Motion to recess** - This motion, if passed, requires the body to immediately take a recess. Normally, the chair determines the length of the recess which may be a few minutes or several hours. It requires a simple majority vote.  
**Motion to fix the time to adjourn** - This motion, if passed, requires the body to adjourn the meeting at the specific time set in the motion. It requires a simple majority vote.  
**Motion to table** – This motion, if passed, requires discussion of the agenda item to be halted and the agenda item to be placed on “hold.” The motion can contain a specific time in which the item can come back to the body, or the motion can contain no specific time for the return of the item. If no specific time is included in the motion, those individuals responsible for setting the body’s agenda shall identify when the item returns for consideration by the body. Motions to table require a simple majority vote.  
**Motion to limit debate** – The most common form of this motion is to say, “I move the previous question” or “I move the question” or “I call the question.” As a practical matter, when a member uses one of these phrases, the chair can expedite matters by treating it as a request rather than as a formal motion. The chair can simply inquire of the body “any further discussion?” If no one wishes to have further discussion, the chair can go right to the pending motion that is on the floor. However, if even one person wishes to discuss the pending motion further, then at that point, the chair should treat the call for the “question” as a formal motion and proceed to it. Motions to limit debate require a two-thirds vote.  

**Majority and Super Majority Votes**  
All motions require at least a simple majority vote. A tie vote means the motion fails. For example, in a seven-member body, a vote of 4-3 passes a motion. A vote of 3-3 with one abstention means the motion fails. If one member is absent and the vote is 3-3 the motion still fails.  
There are exceptions when a motion requires a super majority vote:  
**Motion to limit debate** - This motion decides on a motion before the body and requires a two-thirds vote to be approved.  
**Motion to close nominations** – A motion to close nominations for officers (such as the chair) effectively cuts off the right of the minority to nominate officers and it requires a two-thirds vote to pass.  
**Motion to object to the consideration of a question** - Normally, such a motion is unnecessary since the objectionable item can be tabled or defeated straight up. However, when members of a body do not even want an item on the agenda to be considered, then such a motion is in order. It is not debatable, and it requires a two-thirds vote to pass.  

**Counting Votes**  
Quorum is determined by the body’s bylaws or other governance documents.  
All motions must receive a second and an “aye” vote by a majority of the body to be adopted. Abstentions votes can be used to meet quorum requirements but are not calculated in determining the outcome of the vote.  

**Courtesy and Decorum**  
Debate and discussion should be focused, but free and open. In the interest of time, the chair may, however, limit the time allotted to speakers, including members of the body. A member cannot generally interrupt a speaker however there are a few exceptions:  
**Privilege** – A member can call for a “point of privilege.” The chair should then interrupt to ask the interrupter to state their point. Appropriate points of privilege relate to anything that would interfere with the normal comfort of the meeting. For example, the room may be too hot or too cold, or a blowing fan might interfere with a person’s ability to hear.  
**Order** – A member can call for a “point of order.” Again, the chair would ask the interrupter to “state your point.” Appropriate points of order relate to anything that would not be considered appropriate conduct of the meeting. For example, if the chair moved on to a vote on a motion that permits debate without allowing that discussion or debate.  
**Appeal** – If the chair makes a ruling that a member of the body disagrees with, the member may appeal the ruling of the chair. If the motion is seconded, and after debate, if it passes by a simple majority vote, then the ruling of the chair is deemed reversed.  
**Call for orders of the day** – This is simply another way of saying “return to the agenda.” If a member believes that the body has drifted from the agreed-upon agenda, such a call may be made. It does not require a vote, and when the chair discovers that the agenda has not been followed, the
<!-- Page 41 -->
![Appendix A – Rules of Order](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Appendix+A+%E2%80%93+Rules+of+Order)

chair simply reminds the body to return to the agenda item properly before them. If the chair fails to do so, the chair's determination may be appealed.  
Withdraw a motion – During debate and discussion of a motion, the maker of the motion on the floor, at any time, may interrupt a speaker to withdraw his or her motion from the floor.

**AGENDA ITEM:** G-8  
**MEETING DATE:** 04/23/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Short-Term Nutrition Services - Supervisor III  
**CHECK ONE:**  
- For Discussion: ☐  
- For Action: ☑  
- Report: ☐  
- Workshop: ☐  
- Recognition: ☐  
- Emergency Action: ☐  

**DEPARTMENT:** Nutrition Services  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the extension of the short-term Nutrition Services - Supervisor III. The creation of this short- term assignment was Board approved on January 23, 2024. This position runs from January 24, 2024, until May 7, 2024. Due to an upcoming retirement in the Nutrition Services Department, the recommendation of the superintendent is to extend the position until June 7, 2024. The extension proposed would allow the Nutrition Services Department to provide training and a successful transition to the Short-Term Nutrition Services – Supervisor III. The extension proposed would keep the position under 75% of the school year worked.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
California Education Code Section 45103 requires that before employing a short-term employee, the governing board of a school district, at a regularly scheduled board meeting, shall specify the service required to be performed by the employee pursuant to the definition of “classification” in subdivision (a) of Section 45101, and shall certify the ending date of the service.

Nutrition Services requires the extension of the support of a short-term Nutrition Services - Supervisor III to cover the area serviced by a current Nutrition Services - Supervisor III. The current Nutrition Services - Supervisor III will be out on a board approved leave of absence until May 7, 2024. Nutrition Services will be using this short-term assignment to provide training and a successful transition for the employee returning from the board approved leave and to support an upcoming retirement.

**ATTACHMENTS:** N/A  

**BOARD COMMITTEE ACTION/COMMENT:** N/A  

**PREVIOUS STAFF/BOARD ACTION:**  
- Board of Education: approval of Short-Term Nutrition Services Supervisor III position – 01/23/2024

### Identified Themes Districtwide
- Staff that are kind, helpful, understanding, engaging, and inclusive help students learn and feel welcomed and safe.
- More is needed to address bullying, fighting, harassment, and disruptive behavior for students to learn and feel safe.
- More communication of resources, opportunities, and events is needed.
- Students want clear relevance of academics to the real world, especially to careers and the workforce.
- Programs that build skills and provide resources help with academics and confidence in the future.
- Students enjoy interactive, hands-on, fun learning and want more.

### Our Recommendations
- Provide staff professional development (PD) on supporting emotional wellness, cultural inclusivity, and linking students to resources that meet their needs.
- Update rules and consequences for harassment and disruptive behavior and clearly communicate these to students. Provide staff PD on how to address these behaviors.
- Use a variety of communication methods to increase awareness of resources and opportunities, including targeted outreach to relevant populations.
- Provide a range of career exploration opportunities at all grade levels. Support teachers in making clear connections to students’ futures.
- Increase access to and awareness of the AVID program and/or the opportunities, resources, and skill-building it offers.
- Increase hands-on, collaborative, and project-based learning during the school day.

**Crowe LLP**  
Independent Member Crowe Global  

**Audit Committee**  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**

**Opinions**  
We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the San Juan Unified School District, as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the San Juan Unified School District’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the San Juan Unified School District, as of June 30, 2023, and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Basis for Opinions**  
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards (Government Auditing Standards), issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the San Juan Unified School District, and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**  
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the San Juan Unified School District’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the San Juan Unified School District’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the San Juan Unified School District’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

## Required Supplementary Information

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 4 to 10 and the General Fund Budgetary Comparison Schedule, the Schedule of Changes in the District’s Total Other Postemployment Benefits (OPEB) Liability, the Schedule of the District’s Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability, and the Schedule of the District’s Contributions on pages 57 to 62 be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

![Supplementary Information](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Supplementary+Information)

**Supplementary Information**

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the San Juan Unified School District's basic financial statements. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards, as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards and other supplementary information are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, except for that portion marked “unaudited”; was derived from, and relates directly to, the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information, has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

San Juan Unified School District  
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023  

The management’s discussion and analysis of San Juan Unified School District’s financial performance provides an overall review of the District’s financial activities for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The intent of this discussion and analysis is to look at the District’s financial performance as a whole. To provide a complete understanding of the District’s financial performance, please read it in conjunction with the Independent Auditor’s Report on pages 1 through 3, the District’s financial statements which begin on page 12, and the notes to the financial statements on pages 25 through 56.

The Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is an element of the reporting model adopted by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) in their Statement No. 34 Basic Financial Statements – and Management’s Discussion and Analysis – for State and Local Governments issued June 1999. Certain comparative information is required to be presented in the MD&A.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

This annual report consists of three parts: (1) management’s discussion and analysis (this section); (2) the financial statements; and (3) required supplementary information. The financial statements include two kinds of statements that present different views of the San Juan Unified School District.

- The first two statements are district-wide financial statements that provide both short-term and long-term information about the District’s overall financial status.
- The remaining statements are fund financial statements that focus on individual parts of the District, report the District’s operations and in more detail than the district wide statements.

The financial statements also include notes that explain some of the information in the statements and provide more detailed data. The statements are followed by a section of required supplementary information that further explains and supports the financial statements with a comparison of the District’s budget for the year. The remainder of the management’s discussion and analysis highlights the structure and contents of each of the statements.

The district-wide statements report information about the District as a whole. The statement of net position includes all of the District’s assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and deferred inflows of resources. All of the current year’s revenues and expenditures are accounted for in the statement of activities regardless of when cash is received or paid.

The two district-wide statements report the District’s assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities and deferred inflows of resources as a measure of the District’s financial position.

<!-- Page 64 -->
In the district-wide financial statements the District’s activities are divided into two categories:

- **Governmental activities** – Most of the District’s basic services are included here, such as regular and special education, transportation, and administration. State support from local control funding formula and categorical apportionments finance most of these activities.

- **Business-type activities** – The District does not currently have any business type activities.

### Fund Financial Statements

The fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the District’s most significant funds. Funds are accounting devices the District uses to keep track of specific sources of funding and spending on particular programs:

- Some funds are required by State law and by bond covenants.

- The District establishes other funds to control and manage money for particular purposes (like repaying its long-term debts) or to show that it is properly using certain revenues (like federal grants).

The District has three kinds of funds:

- **Governmental Funds** - Most of the District’s basic services are included in governmental funds, which generally focus on (1) how cash, and other financial assets that can readily be converted to cash, flow in and out and (2) the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. Consequently, the governmental funds statements provide a detailed short-term view that helps you determine whether there are more or fewer financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the District’s programs. Because this information does not encompass the additional long-term focus of the district-wide statements, we provide additional information at the bottom of the governmental funds statements that explain the relationship (or differences) between them.

- **Proprietary Funds** - Services for which the District charges a fee are generally reported in proprietary funds. Proprietary funds are reported in the same way as the district-wide statements. The District’s enterprise funds (one type of proprietary fund) are the same as its business-type activities, but provide more detail and additional information, such as cash flows. Internal service funds (the other kind of proprietary fund) are used to report activities that provide supplies and services for the District’s other programs and activities. The District currently has one internal service fund -- the employee self-insurance fund.

- **Fiduciary Funds** - The District is the trustee, or fiduciary, for assets that belong to others, such as the scholarship fund. The District is responsible for ensuring that the assets reported in these funds are used only for their intended purposes and by those to whom the assets belong.

| **Total Net Position** | **185,633,997** | **3,343,926** | **182,290,071** | **545%** |

The change in Total Assets is primarily a result of the following:

- Current and other assets include cash, including cash with fiscal agent, receivables, investments, due from (to) other funds, stores inventory and pre-paid expenses. Current assets increased by $2,671,961 due to cash received from one-time grants received prior to June 30 and an increase in the stores balance.

- At the end of fiscal year 2022-23, the District had a total value of $1,406,350,940 in capital assets. Capital assets include land, buildings, land improvements, equipment and capital projects that are still in progress. Total accumulated depreciation amounted to $433,523,664. The net capital assets amounted to $972,827,276, an increase of $85,383,211 from prior year. This is a result of increased capital projects being handled and completed through Measures J, N and P.

The change in Total Liabilities is primarily a result of the following:

- An increase in current liabilities of $25,106,588 is attributable to goods and services received prior to June 30, 2023 that had not been paid and unearned revenue. Current liabilities include accounts payable, unearned revenue, interagency balances and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. (See “Statement of Net Position” chart.)

- The District ended the year with a total of $1,337,368,328 in outstanding financing obligations, including other post-employment benefits (OPEB), compensated absences and net pension liabilities. The decrease in long-term debt of $67,727,519 is mainly attributed to net pension liabilities and issuance of general obligation bonds.

![Financial Highlights](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Financial+Highlights)

**FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS**

The District’s change in net position from prior year was $182,209,071. Revenues increased by $120,784,800 which is primarily attributable to the increase in Taxes and subventions, federal and state resources. Expenditures have a net increase of $80,123,252 which is primarily due to increased costs of instruction related staffing and instructional materials, increase in student support service expense from pandemic related resources and other one-time funding being spent in the current year and a decrease in general administration costs.

![General Fund Balance](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=General+Fund+Balance)

The District’s General Fund overall experienced an increase in its fund balance by $105,566,231. Revenue increased by $108.5 million which is mainly due to the LCFF calculation, mandated cost reimbursements, Special Education grants, and additional COVID Relief funds.

The District also experienced an overall increase in expenditures. There were increases in certificated salaries due to additional training and staffing changes as the District continues to spend the COVID funds to provide additional support and service functions for students. There was an increase in supplies and capital outlay to supply students and staff with the necessary supplies, for additional instructional supports. This included additional summer programs to mitigate the learning losses students were facing. 

9.
<!-- Page 69 -->
![Enrollment](https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Enrollment+Chart)

The District experienced an increase in student enrollment between FY21-22 and FY 22-23. An increase is also expected to be seen in FY 23-24.

**FINANCIAL ISSUES**

The development of future budgets will be influenced by uncertain, external variables such as the State Budget, priorities of new state leadership, and pension costs. Internal factors of compensation and number of employees must be commensurate with the number of students. San Juan Unified School District must be vigilant in monitoring all expenditures to avoid fiscal distress.

The district has adopted a range of instructional models and opportunities to support the academic and social and emotional needs of all students in response to the impact of the pandemic.

**NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

San Juan Unified School District (the "District") accounts for its financial transactions in accordance with the policies and procedures of the California Department of Education’s California School Accounting Manual. The accounting policies of the District conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. The following is a summary of the more significant policies:

**Reporting Entity:** The Board of Education is the level of government which has governance responsibilities over all activities related to public school education in the San Juan Unified School District. The Board is not included in any other governmental "reporting entity" as defined by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board since Board members have decision-making authority, the power to designate management, the responsibility to significantly influence operations and primary accountability for fiscal matters.

**Basis of Presentation - Financial Statements:** The basic financial statements include a Management’s Discussion and Analysis section providing an analysis of the District’s overall financial position and results of operations, financial statements prepared using full accrual accounting for all of the District’s activities, including infrastructure, and a focus on the major funds.

**Basis of Presentation - Government-Wide Financial Statements:** The Statement of Activities displays information about the reporting government as a whole. Custodial funds are not included in the government-wide financial statements. Custodial funds are reported only in the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position at the fund financial statement level.

The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities are prepared using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues, expenses, gains, losses, assets and liabilities resulting from exchange and exchange-like transactions are recognized when the exchange takes place. Revenues, expenses, gains, losses, assets and liabilities resulting from nonexchange transactions are recognized in accordance with the requirements of Governmental Accounting Standards Board Codification Section (GASB Cod. Sec.) N50.118-.121.

**Program revenues:** Program revenues included in the Statement of Activities derive directly from the program itself or from parties outside the District’s taxpayers or citizenry, as a whole; program revenues reduce the cost of the function to be financed from the District’s general revenues.

**Allocation of indirect expenses:** The District reports all direct expenses by function in the Statement of Activities. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a function. Depreciation expense is specifically identified and is included in the direct expense of each function. Interest on general long-term liabilities is considered an indirect expense and is reported separately on the Statement of Activities.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

**Basis of Presentation - Fund Accounting:** The accounts of the District are organized on the basis of funds, each of which is considered to be a separate accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, deferred outflows, liabilities, deferred inflows, fund equity, revenues, and expenditures or expenses, as appropriate. District resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled.

**A - Major Funds**

The General Fund is the general operating fund of the District and accounts for all revenues and expenditures of the District not encompassed within other funds. All general tax revenues and other receipts that are not allocated by law or contractual agreement to some other fund are accounted for in this fund. General operating expenditures and the capital improvement costs that are not paid through other funds are paid from the General Fund.

The Building Fund is a capital projects fund used to account for resources used for the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities by the District.

The Bond Interest and Redemption Fund is a debt service fund used to account for the accumulation of resources for the payment of principal and interest related to the General Obligation Bonds.

**B - Other Funds**

Special Revenue Funds are used to account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are legally restricted to expenditures for specified purposes. This includes the Student Activity, the Charter Schools, Adult Education, Child Development, Cafeteria and Deferred Maintenance Funds.

Capital Projects Funds are used to account for resources used for the acquisition or construction of major capital facilities by the District. This includes the Capital Facilities, County School Facilities, and Special Reserve for Capital Outlay Projects Funds.

The Self-Insurance Fund is an internal service fund which is used to account for the District’s workers’ compensation claims, employee vision and dental benefits.

The Special Education Pass-Through Fund is a Custodial Fund used by the District to account for Special Education pass-through funds.

**Basis of Accounting:** Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures or expenses are recognized in the accounts and reported in the basic financial statements. Basis of accounting relates to the timing of the measurement made, regardless of the measurement focus applied.

**Accrual:** Governmental activities in the government-wide financial statements and the proprietary and fiduciary fund financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred.

### NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  

**Modified Accrual:** The governmental funds financial statements are presented on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under the modified accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recorded when susceptible to accrual; i.e., both measurable and available. "Available" means collectible within the current period or within 60 days after year end. Expenditures are generally recognized under the modified accrual basis of accounting when the related liability is incurred. The exception to this general rule is that principal and interest on general obligation long-term liabilities, if any, is recognized when due.  

**Budgets and Budgetary Accounting:** By state law, the Board of Education must adopt a final budget by July 1. A public hearing is conducted to receive comments prior to adoption. The Board of Education complied with these requirements.  

**Receivables:** Receivables are made up principally of amounts due from the State of California and Categorical programs. The District has determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts was needed as of June 30, 2023.  

**Stores Inventory:** Stores inventory in the General and Cafeteria Funds consists mainly of consumable supplies held for future use and are valued at actual cost. Inventories are recorded as expenditures at the time individual inventory items are transferred from the warehouse to schools and offices.  

**Capital Assets:** Capital assets purchased or acquired, with an original cost of $15,000 or more, are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical cost. Contributed assets are reported at acquisition value for the contributed asset. Additions, improvements and other capital outlay that significantly extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Other costs incurred for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Capital assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over 4 - 30 years depending on asset types.  

**Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources:** In addition to assets, the statement of net position includes a separate section for deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of net position that applies to a future period(s), and as such will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditures) until then. The District has recognized deferred loss on refunding resulting from the difference in the carrying value of refunded debt and its reacquisition price. This amount is deferred and amortized over the shorter life of the refunded or refunding debt. Additionally, the District has recognized a deferred outflow of resources related to the recognition of the net pension liability and OPEB liability reported in the Statement of Net Position.  

In addition to liabilities, the statement of net position includes a separate section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s) and as such, will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time. The District has recognized a deferred inflow of resources related to the recognition of the net pension liability and OPEB liability reported which is in the Statement of Net Position.

### June 30, 2023  

**NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)**  

**Pensions:** For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the State Teachers’ Retirement Plan (STRP) and Public Employees Retirement Fund B (PERF B) and additions to/deductions from STRP's and PERF B's fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by STRP and PERF B. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Certain investments are reported at fair value. The following is a summary of pension amounts in aggregate:

|                     | STRP         | PERF B       | Total        |
|---------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Deferred outflows of resources | $79,021,081  | $71,396,604  | $150,417,685 |
| Deferred inflows of resources  | $75,877,000  | $9,044,000   | $84,921,000  |
| Net pension liability          | $237,502,000 | $193,836,000 | $431,338,000 |
| Pension expense                | $28,366,906  | $22,525,575  | $50,912,481  |

**Interfund Activity:** Interfund activity is reported as either loans, services provided, reimbursements or transfers. Loans are reported as interfund receivables and payables as appropriate and are subject to elimination upon consolidation. Services provided, deemed to be at market or near market rates, are treated as revenues and expenditures/expenses. Reimbursements are when one fund incurs a cost that the appropriate benefiting fund and reduces its related cost as a reimbursement. All interfund transactions are treated as transfers. Transfers between governmental funds are reported as part of the reconciliation to the government-wide financial statements.

**Compensated Absences:** Compensated absences benefits totaling $5,210,753 are recorded as a long-term liability of the District. The liability is for the earned but unused benefits.

**Accumulated Sick Leave:** Sick leave benefits are accumulated for each employee. The employees do not gain a vested right to accumulated sick leave. Accumulated employee sick leave benefits are not recognized as liabilities of the District since cash payment of such benefits is not probable. Therefore, sick leave benefits are recorded as expenditures in the period that sick leave is taken.

**Unearned Revenue:** Revenue from federal, state, and local special projects and programs is recognized when qualified expenditures have been incurred. Funds received but not earned are recorded as unearned revenue until earned.

**Net Position:** Net position is displayed in three components:

1. **Net Investment in Capital Assets** - Consists of capital assets including restricted capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and reduced by the outstanding balances (excluding unspent bond proceeds) of any bonds, mortgages, notes or other borrowings that are attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets.

2. **Restricted Net Position** - Restrictions of the ending net position indicate the portions of net position not appropriate for expenditure or amounts legally segregated for a specific future use. The restriction for legally restricted programs represents the portion of net position restricted to specific program expenditures. The restriction for debt service represents the portion of net position available for the retirement of debt. The restriction for capital projects represents the portion of net position restricted for capital projects. The restriction for self-insurance represents the portion of net position restricted for payment of the self-insured claims. It is the District's policy to use restricted net position first when allowable expenditures are incurred.

**NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)**

3 - Unrestricted Net Position - All other net position that does not meet the definitions of "restricted" or "net investment in capital assets".

Fund Balance Classifications: Governmental Accounting Standards Board Codification Sections 1300 and 1800, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions (GASB Cod. Sec. 1300 and 1800) implements a five-tier fund balance classification hierarchy that depicts the extent to which a government is bound by spending constraints imposed on the use of its resources. The five classifications, discussed in more detail below, are nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned and unassigned.

A - Nonspendable Fund Balance:
The nonspendable fund balance classification reflects amounts that are not in spendable form, such as revolving fund cash, prepaid expenditures and stores inventory.

B - Restricted Fund Balance:
The restricted fund balance classification reflects amounts subject to externally imposed and legally enforceable constraints. Such constraints may be imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments, or may be imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. These are the same restrictions used to determine restricted net position as reported in the government-wide statements.

C - Committed Fund Balance:
The committed fund balance classification reflects amounts subject to internal constraints self-imposed by formal action of the Board of Education. The constraints giving rise to committed fund balance must be imposed no later than the end of the reporting period. The actual amounts may be determined subsequent to that date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Formal action by the Board of Education is required to remove any commitment from any fund balance. At June 30, 2023, the District had $41,226,291 in committed fund balances.

D - Assigned Fund Balance:
The assigned fund balance classification reflects amounts that the District’s Board of Education has approved to be used for specific purposes, based on the District’s intent related to those specific purposes. The Board of Education can designate personnel with the authority to assign fund balances, however as of June 30, 2023, no such designation has occurred.

E - Unassigned Fund Balance:
In the General Fund only, the unassigned fund balance classification reflects the residual balance that has not been assigned to other funds and that is not restricted, committed, or assigned to specific purposes.

In any fund other than the General Fund, a positive unassigned fund balance is never reported because amounts in any other fund are assumed to have been assigned, at least, to the purpose of that fund. However, deficits in any fund, including the General Fund that cannot be eliminated by reducing or eliminating amounts assigned to other purposes are reported as negative unassigned fund balance.

### NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  

**Fund Balance Policy:** The District has an expenditure policy relating to fund balances. For purposes of fund balance classifications, expenditures are to be spent from restricted fund balances first, followed in order by committed fund balances (if any), assigned fund balances and lastly unassigned fund balances.  

While GASB Cod. Sec. 1300 and 1800 do not require districts to establish a minimum fund balance policy or a stabilization arrangement, GASB Cod. Sec. 1300 and 1800 do require the disclosure of a minimum fund balance policy and stabilization arrangements, if they have been adopted by the Board of Education. At June 30, 2023, the District has not established a minimum fund balance policy nor has it established a stabilization arrangement.  

**Property Taxes:** Secured property taxes are attached as an enforceable lien on property as of March 1. Taxes are due in two installments on or before December 10 and April 10. Unsecured property taxes are due in one installment on or before August 31. The County of Sacramento bills and collects taxes for the District. Tax revenues are recognized by the District when received.  

**Eliminations and Reclassifications:** In the process of aggregating data for the Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities, some amounts reported as interfund activity and balances in the funds were eliminated or reclassified. Interfund receivables and payables were eliminated to minimize the "grossing up" effect on assets and liabilities within the governmental activities column.  

**Estimates:** The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenditures or expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results may differ from those estimates.  

**New Accounting Pronouncements:** In May 2020, the GASB issued GASB Statement No. 96, Subscription-Based Information Technology Arrangements. GASB 96 defines a subscription-based information technology arrangement and requires the recognition of a right to use subscription asset and corresponding subscription liability. This statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2022. There was no impact to the District’s July 1, 2022 net position as a result of the implementation of GASB Statement No. 96.

| **Total**                         | $ 571,725,568          |

**Pooled Funds:** In accordance with Education Code Section 41001, the District maintains substantially all of its cash in the interest-bearing Sacramento County Treasurer’s Pooled Investment Fund. The District is considered to be an involuntary participant in an external investment pool. The fair value of the District's investment in the pool is reported in the financial statements at amounts based upon the District’s pro-rata share of the fair value provided by the County Treasurer for the entire portfolio (in relation to the amortized cost of that portfolio). The balance available for withdrawal is based on the accounting records maintained by the County Treasurer, which is recorded on the amortized cost basis.

**Deposits - Custodial Credit Risk:** The District limits custodial credit risk by ensuring uninsured balances are collateralized by the respective financial institution. Cash balances held in banks are insured up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and are collateralized by the respective financial institution. At June 30, 2023, the carrying amount of the District’s accounts was $2,755,312 and the bank balance was $4,879,781, of which $4,629,781 was uninsured.

**Cash with Fiscal Agent:** Cash with Fiscal Agent represents funds held by Fiscal Agents restricted for capital projects and repayment of General Obligation Bonds. The District holds their funds with the Sacramento County Treasurer. The balance available for withdrawal is based on the accounting records maintained by the County Treasurer, which is recorded on the amortized cost basis.

**Interest Rate Risk:** The District does not have a formal investment policy that limits cash and investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. At June 30, 2023, the District had no significant interest rate risk related to cash and investments held.

**Credit Risk:** The District does not have a formal investment policy that limits its investment choices other than the limitations of state law.

**Concentration of Credit Risk:** The District does not place limits on the amount it may invest in any one issuer. At June 30, 2023, the District had no concentration of credit risk.

**NOTE 5 - SELF-INSURANCE**

The District has established a self-insurance fund to account for the risk of loss for workers' compensation, employee vision benefits and employee dental benefits. Settled claims resulting from these risks have not exceeded coverage in any of the past five fiscal years. There has been no reduction in insurance coverage from the previous year.

The Self-Insurance Fund provides coverage up to statutory limits for each workers’ compensation claim. Beginning July 1, 1996 up to June 30, 2001 the District was fully insured for workers’ compensation losses with Firemans’ Fund. On July 1, 2001, the District returned to a self-insured program. This program provides coverage up to $750,000 per occurrence. The District has coverage for claims in excess of this amount through Safety National Casualty Corporation. All other benefits covered by the Self-Insurance Fund are fully insured with no excess coverage purchased.

The workers’ compensation claims liability of $9,878,000 is based on an actuarial study as of June 30, 2023 discounted at 1.0 percent. The Dental and Vision claims liabilities of $208,078 and $9,686, respectively are calculated based on an incremental lag factor methodology. Changes in the Fund’s claims liability for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2023 were as follows:

| Workers' Compensation | Dental | Vision | Total |
|-----------------------|--------|--------|-------|
| Claims Liability at, June 30, 2021 | $ 9,344,514 | $ 198,066 | $ 19,870 | $ 9,562,450 |

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### June 30, 2023  

### NOTE 8 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – STATE TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT PLAN  

**General Information about the State Teachers’ Retirement Plan**  

**Plan Description:** Teaching-certified employees of the District are provided with pensions through the State Teachers’ Retirement Plan (STRP) – a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS). The Teachers’ Retirement Law (California Education Code Section 22000 et seq.), as enacted and amended by the California Legislature, established this plan and CalSTRS as the administrator. The benefit terms of the plan may be amended through legislation. CalSTRS issues a publicly available financial report that can be obtained at [http://www.calstrs.com](http://www.calstrs.com).

**Benefits Provided:** The STRP Defined Benefit Program has two benefit formulas:
- **CalSTRS 2% at 60:** Members first hired on or before December 31, 2012, to perform service that could be creditable to CalSTRS.
- **CalSTRS 2% at 62:** Members first hired on or after January 1, 2013, to perform service that could be creditable to CalSTRS.

The Defined Benefit (DB) Program provides retirement benefits based on members’ final compensation, age and years of service credit. In addition, the retirement program provides benefits to members upon disability and to survivors/beneficiaries upon the death of eligible members. There are several differences between the two benefit formulas which are noted below.

**CalSTRS 2% at 60 - CalSTRS 2% at 60 members are eligible for normal retirement at age 60, with a minimum of five years of credited service. The normal retirement benefit is equal to 2.0 percent of final compensation for each year of credited service. Early retirement options are available at age 55 with five years of credited service or as early as age 50 with 30 years of credited service. The age factor for retirements after age 60 increases with each quarter year of age to 2.4 percent at age 63 or older. Members who have 30 years or more of credited service receive an additional increase of up to 0.2 percent to the age factor, up to the 2.4 percent maximum.**

CalSTRS calculates retirement benefits based on a one-year final compensation for members who retired on or after January 1, 2001, with 25 or more years of credited service, or for classroom teachers with less than 25 years of credited service if the employer elected to pay the additional benefit cost prior to January 1, 2014. One-year final compensation means a member’s highest average annual compensation could earn in a school year while employed on a full-time basis, for a position in which the person worked. For members with less than 25 years of credited service, final compensation is the highest average annual compensation earnable for any 36 consecutive months of credited service.

**CalSTRS 2% at 62 - CalSTRS 2% at 62 members are eligible for normal retirement at age 62, with a minimum of five years of credited service. The normal retirement benefit is equal to 2.0 percent of final compensation for each year of credited service. An early retirement option is available at age 55. The age factor for retirement after age 62 increases with each quarter year of age to 2.4 percent at age 65 or older.**

All CalSTRS 2% at 62 members have their final compensation based on their highest average annual compensation earnable for 36 consecutive months of credited service.

**Contributions:** Required member, employer and state contribution rates are set by the California Legislature and Governor and detailed in Teachers’ Retirement Law. Current contribution rates were established by California Assembly Bill 1469 (CalSTRS Funding Plan), which was passed into law in June 2014, and various subsequent legislation.

### NOTE 8 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – STATE TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT PLAN (Continued)

The CalSTRS Funding Plan established a schedule of contribution rate increases shared among members, employers, and the State of California to bring CalSTRS toward full funding by fiscal year 2046. California Senate Bill 90 and California Assembly Bill 84 (collectively the “Special Legislation”), were signed into law in June 2019 and June 2020, respectively, and provided supplemental contributions to the DB Program along with supplemental contribution rate relief to employers through fiscal year 2021–22.

A summary of statutory contribution rates and other sources of contributions to the Defined Benefit Program pursuant to the CalSTRS Funding Plan, and the Special Legislation, are as follows:

**Members** - Under CalSTRS 2% at 60, the member contribution rate was 10.250 percent of applicable member earnings for fiscal year 2021-22. Under CalSTRS 2% at 62, members contribute 50 percent of the normal cost of their retirement plan, which resulted in a contribution rate of 10.205 percent of applicable member earnings for fiscal year 2021-22.

Under CalSTRS 2% at 62, members pay 9% toward the normal cost and an additional 1.205 percent as per the CalSTRS Funding Plan for a total member contribution rate of 10.205 percent. The contribution rate for CalSTRS 2% at 62 members is adjusted if the normal cost increases or decreases by more than 1% since the last time the member contribution rate was set. Based on the June 30, 2021, valuation adopted by the CalSTRS board in May 2022, the increase in normal cost was less than 1 percent. Therefore, the contribution rate for CalSTRS 2% at 62 members did not change effective July 1, 2022.

**Employers** - Employers are required to base a contribution rate in statute at 8.25%. Pursuant to the CalSTRS Funding Plan, employers also have a supplemental contribution rate to eliminate their share of the CalSTRS unfunded actuarial obligation by 2046.

Beginning in fiscal year 2021–22, the CalSTRS Funding Plan authorized the CalSTRS board to adjust the employer supplemental contribution rate up or down by a maximum of 1% for a total rate of no higher than 20.25% and no lower than 8.25%. In May 2022, the CalSTRS board voted to keep the employer supplemental contribution rate at 10.85% for fiscal year 2022–23 for a total employer contribution rate of 19.10%.

The CalSTRS employer contribution rates effective for fiscal year 2022-23 through fiscal year 2046-47 are summarized in the table below:

| Effective Date | Base Rate | Supplemental Rate Per CalSTRS Funding Plan | Total |
|----------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------|-------|
| July 1, 2022   | 8.250%    | 10.850%                                    | 19.100% |
| July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2046 | 8.250% | (1) | (1) |
| July 1, 2046   | 8.250%    | Increase from AB 1469 rate ends in 2046-47 |       |

(1) The CalSTRS Funding Plan authorizes the board to adjust the employer contribution rate up or down by up to 1% each year, but no higher than 20.250% total and no lower than 8.250%.

The District contributed $45,588,081 to the plan for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.

NOTE 8 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – STATE TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT PLAN (Continued)

State – 10.828 percent of the members’ calculated based on creditable compensation from two fiscal years prior.

The state is required to contribute a base contribution rate set in statute at 2.017%. Pursuant to the CalSTRS Funding Plan, the state also has a supplemental contribution rate, which the board can increase by up to 0.5% each fiscal year to help eliminate the state’s share of the CalSTRS unfunded actuarial obligation by 2046. In May 2022, the CalSTRS board voted to keep the state supplemental contribution rate at 6.311% for fiscal year 2022–23 for a total contribution rate of 10.828%.

Special legislation appropriated supplemental state contributions to reduce the state’s portion of the unfunded actuarial obligation of the DB Program in fiscal years 2019-20 through 2021-22. These contributions are funded from future excess General Fund revenues, pursuant to the requirements of California Proposition 2, the “Rainy-Day Budget Stabilization Fund Act”, which passed in 2014. Accordingly, the contribution amounts are subject to change each year based on the availability of funding. For fiscal year 2021–22, CalSTRS received $410.0 million in supplemental state contributions from Proposition 2 funds. Additionally, CalSTRS received a one-time supplemental payment of $173.7 million from the General Fund in fiscal year 2021–22 to offset forgone contributions due to the suspension of the 0.5% increase to the state supplemental contribution rate in fiscal year 2020–21.

The CalSTRS state contribution rates effective for fiscal year 2022-23 and beyond are summarized in the table below.

| Effective Date       | Base Rate | Rate Per CalSTRS Funding Plan | SBMA Funding(1) | Total      |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|------------------|------------|
| July 01, 2022        | 2.017%    | 6.311%                        | 2.50%            | 10.828%    |
| July 01, 2023 to June 30, 2046 | 2.017%    | (2)                           | 2.50% (2)        |            |
| July 01, 2046       | 2.017%    | (3)                           | 2.50% (3)        |            |

(1) The SBMA contribution rate excludes the $72 million that is reduced from the required contribution in accordance with Education Code section 22954.

(2) The CalSTRS board has limited authority to adjust the state contribution rate annually through June 2046 in order to eliminate the remaining unfunded actuarial obligation. The board cannot increase the supplemental rate by more than 0.5% in a fiscal year, and if there is no unfunded actuarial obligation, the supplemental contribution rate imposed would be reduced to 0%.

(3) From July 1, 2046, and thereafter, the rates in effect prior to July 1, 2014, are reinstated, if necessary, to address any remaining unfunded actuarial obligation.

**NOTE 8 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – STATE TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT PLAN (Continued)**

Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions - At June 30, 2023, the District reported a liability for its proportionate share of the net pension liability that reflected a reduction for State pension support provided to the District. The amount recognized by the District as its proportionate share of the net pension liability, the related State support, and the total portion of the net pension liability that was associated with the District were as follows:

| Description | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| District's proportionate share of the net pension liability | $ 237,502,000 |
| State's proportionate share of the net pension liability associated with the District | $ 134,242,000 |
| **Total** | **$ 371,744,000** |

The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2023 and the total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2021. The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on the District’s share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the contributions of all participating school districts and the State. At June 30, 2023, the District’s proportion was 0.342 percent, which was an increase of 0.025 percent from its proportion measured as of June 30, 2022.

For the year ended June 30, 2023, the District recognized pension expense of $28,386,906 and revenue of $21,538,056 for support provided by the State. At June 30, 2023, the District reported deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions from the following sources:

| Description | Deferred Outflows of Resources | Deferred Inflows of Resources |
|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Difference between expected and actual experience | $ 195,000 | $ 17,808,000 |

NOTE 8 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – STATE TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT PLAN (Continued)

$45,588,081 reported as deferred outflows of resources related to pensions resulting from contributions subsequent to the measurement date will be recognized as a reduction of the net pension liability in the year ended June 30, 2024. Other amounts reported as deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions will be recognized in pension expense as follows:

Year Ending  
June 30.  
2024  $ (9,336,717)  
2025  $ (18,388,717)  
2026  $ (25,323,216)  
2027  $ 13,052,450  
2028  $ (4,424,300)  
2029  $ 1,976,500  

Differences between expected and actual experience and changes in assumptions are amortized over a closed period equal to the average remaining service life of plan members, which is 7 years as of the June 30, 2023 measurement date. Deferred outflows and inflows related to differences between projected and actual earnings on plan investments are netted and amortized over a closed 5-year period.

Actuarial Methods and Assumptions: The total pension liability for the STRP was determined by applying update procedures to a financial reporting actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2021, and rolling forward the total pension liability to June 30, 2022. The financial reporting actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2021, used the following actuarial methods and assumptions, applied to all prior periods included in the measurement:

Valuation Date  June 30, 2021  
Experience Study  July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2018  
Actuarial Cost Method  Entry age normal  
Investment Rate of Return  7.10%  
Consumer Price Inflation  2.75%  
Wage Growth  3.50%  
Post-retirement Benefit Increases  2.00% simple for DB, maintain 85%  
Purchasing power level for DB, not applicable for DBS/CBB  

Discount Rate: The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.10 percent, which was unchanged from the prior fiscal year. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from plan members and employers will be made at statutory contribution rates in accordance with the rate increase per AB 1469. Projected inflows from investment earnings were calculated using the long-term assumed investment rate of return (7.10 percent) and assuming that contributions, benefit payments, and administrative expense occur midyear. Based on those assumptions, the STRP’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments to current plan members. Therefore, the long-term assumed investment rate of return was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.

**NOTE 8 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – STATE TEACHERS’ RETIREMENT PLAN (Continued)**

**Mortality:** CalSTRS uses a generational mortality assumption, which involves the use of a base mortality table and projection scales to reflect expected annual reductions in mortality rates at each age, resulting in increases in life expectancies each year into the future. The base mortality tables are CalSTRS custom tables derived to best fit the patterns of mortality among its members. The projection scale was set equal to 110 percent of the ultimate improvement factor from the Mortality Improvement Scale (MP-2019) table, issued by the Society of Actuaries.

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. The best estimate ranges were developed using capital market assumptions from CalSTRS investment staff and investment consultants as inputs to the process.

The actuarial investment rate of return assumption was adopted by the CalSTRS board in January 2020 in conjunction with the most recent experience study. For each current and future valuation, CalSTRS consulting actuary reviews the return assumption for reasonableness based on the most current capital market assumptions. Best estimates of 20-year geometric real rates of return and the assumed asset allocation for each major asset class used in this report to develop the actuarial investment rate of return are summarized in the following table:

| Asset Class          | Assumed Asset Allocation | Long-Term* Expected Rate of Return |
|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Public Equity       | 42%                     | 4.8%                               |
| Real Estate         | 15%                     | 3.6%                               |

# NOTE 9 - NET PENSION LIABILITY - PUBLIC EMPLOYER’S RETIREMENT FUND B

## General Information about the Public Employer’s Retirement Fund B

**Plan Description:** The schools cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan Public Employer’s Retirement Fund B (PERF B) is administered by the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). Plan membership consists of non-teaching and non-certified employees of public schools (K-12), community college districts, offices of education, charter and private schools (elective) in the State of California.

The Plan was established to provide retirement, death and disability benefits to non-teaching and noncertified employees in schools. The benefit provisions for Plan employees are established by statute. CalPERS issues a publicly available financial report that can be obtained at:

[CalPERS Financial Report](https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/forms-publications/acfr-2022.pdf).

**Benefits Provided:** The benefits for the defined benefit pension plans are based on members’ years of service, age, final compensation, and benefit formula. Benefits are provided for disability, death, and survivors of eligible members or beneficiaries. Member benefits are defined by law and depend on the respective employer’s benefit formulas. Employer contribution rates are determined by periodic actuarial valuations or by state statute. Actuarial valuations are based on the benefit formulas and employee groups of each employer. Employer contributions, including lump sum contributions made when districts first join the PERF B, are credited with a market value adjustment in determining contribution rates.

The required contribution rates of most active plan members are based on a percentage of salary in excess of a base compensation amount ranging from zero dollars to $863 monthly.

**Required contribution rates for active plan members and employers as a percentage of payroll for the year ended June 30, 2023 were as follows:**

- **Members** - The member contribution rate was 7.0 percent of applicable member earnings for fiscal year 2022-2023.
- **Employers** - The employer contribution rate was 25.37 percent of applicable member earnings.

The District contributed $26,073,604 to the plan for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.

**Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions** - At June 30, 2023, the District reported a liability of $193,836,000 for its proportionate share of the net pension liability. The net pension liability was measured as of June 30, 2023 and the total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2021 The District’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on the District’s share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the contributions of all participating school districts. At June 30, 2023, the District’s proportion was 0.563 percent, which was an increase of 0.035 percent from its proportion measured as of June 30, 2022.

| Post-retirement Benefit Increases    | 2.00% until Purchasing Power Protection Allowance Floor on Purchasing Power Applies, 2.30% thereafter |

The mortality table used was developed based on CalPERS-specific data. The table includes 15 years of mortality improvements using Society of Actuaries 80% of scale MP2020. For more details on this table, please refer to the 2021 experience study report.  

All other actuarial assumptions used in the June 30, 2021 valuation were based on the results of an actuarial experience study for the period from 2000 to 2019, including updates to salary increase, mortality and retirement rates. Further details of the Experience Study can be found at CalPERS’ website.  

During the 2021-22 measurement period, the financial reporting discount rate for PERF B was lowered from 7.15 percent to 6.90 percent. In addition, the inflation assumption was reduced from 2.50 percent to 2.30 percent. Lastly, demographic assumptions for mortality rates were updated.  

The table below reflects long-term expected real rates of return by assumed asset class. The rates of return were calculated using the capital market assumptions applied to determine the discount rate and asset allocation.  

| Asset Class                          | Assumed Asset Allocation | Expected Real Rates of Return Years 1-10 (1, 2) |

**NOTE 9 – NET PENSION LIABILITY – PUBLIC EMPLOYER’S RETIREMENT FUND B (Continued)**

**Discount Rate:** The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 6.90 percent. A projection of the expected benefit payments and contributions was performed to determine if assets would run out. The test revealed the assets would not run out. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability for the Plan. The results of the crossover testing for the Plan are presented in a detailed report that can be obtained at CalPERS' website.

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class.

In determining the long-term expected rate of return, CalPERS took into account long-term market return expectations as well as the expected pension fund cash flows. Projected returns for all asset classes are estimated and combined with risk estimates, are used to project compound (geometric) returns over the long term. The discount rate used to discount liabilities was informed by the long-term projected portfolio return.

**Sensitivity of the District’s Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate:** The following presents the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability calculated using the discount rate of 6.90 percent, as well as what the District’s proportionate share of the net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point lower (5.90 percent) or 1-percentage-point higher (7.90 percent) than the current rate:

| Discount Rate | District's Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1% Decrease (5.90%) | $ 280,005,000 |
| Current Rate (6.90%) | $ 193,836,000 |
| 1% Increase (7.90%) | $ 122,620,000 |

**Pension Plan Fiduciary Net Position:** Detailed information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position is available in the separately issued CalPERS financial report.

**NOTE 10 – OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS**

**Plan Description:** In addition to the pension benefits described in Notes 8 and 9, the District provides post-employment health care benefits (medical and dental) under a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan to all certificated, management and confidential employees who are eligible to retire from the District and have completed a minimum of 5 years of employment with the District. The plan does not issue separate financial statements. Health care benefits are provided for supervisory employees who are eligible to retire under a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan and have completed a minimum of 10 years of employment with the District. Health care benefits are provided to classified and transportation employees, who have reached the age of 55, are eligible to retire under a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan and have completed a minimum of 10 years of employment with the District. Health care benefits are provided to these employees until they have attained the age of 65. As of June 30, 2023 the District has not accumulated assets in a qualified trust for the purpose of paying the benefits related to the District’s Total OPEB Liability.

**Benefits Provided:** The benefits provided are the same as those provided for active employees. Spouses and dependents of eligible retirees are also eligible for medical coverage. All salaried employees of the District are eligible to receive postemployment health care benefits. Hourly employees (i.e. non-salaried with variable work hours) are not eligible to receive postemployment health care benefits.

**Contributions:** California Government Code specifies that the District’s contribution requirements for covered employees are established and may be amended by the Governing Board. Retirees participating in the group insurance plans offered by the District are required to contribute 100 percent of the active premiums. In future years, contributions are assumed to increase at the same rate as premiums. The District’s premium rates being charged to these retirees are lower than the expected cost for a retiree population under age 65. Thus, an implicit subsidy exists as a result of this difference between the actual cost and the true retiree cost.

Contributions to the Plan from the District were $6,589,236 for the year ended June 30, 2023. Employees are not required to contribute to the OPEB plan.

**Total OPEB Liability**

The District’s Total OPEB liability was measured as of June 30, 2022 and was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2023.

**Actuarial Assumptions:** The total OPEB liability in the June 30, 2022 actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement, unless otherwise specified:

| Actuarial Value of Assets | Market Value |
|---------------------------|--------------|
| Mortality Rate            | CalPERS 2017 Experience Study |
| Discount Rate             | 3.69% based on the Fidelity 20 Year AA Municipal Bond maturity yield index. |
| Retirement Rate           | Retirement rates match rates developed in the most recent experience studies for CalPERS (2017) and CalSTRS (2020) |

| **Total** | **$14,853,067** | **$46,043,353** |

$6,589,236 reported as deferred outflows of resources related to benefits paid subsequent to the measurement date will be recognized as a reduction of the Total OPEB Liability in the year ended June 30, 2024. Other amounts reported as deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB will be recognized in OPEB expense as follows:

**Year Ending June 30:**

| Year | Amount |

**NOTE 12 - CONTINGENCIES**  
The District is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the District.  

Also, the District has received state and federal funds for specific purposes that are subject to review or audit by the grantor agencies. Although such audits could generate expenditure disallowances under terms of the grants, it is believed that any required reimbursements will not be material.

![INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON STATE COMPLIANCE](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=INDEPENDENT+AUDITOR%E2%80%99S+REPORT+ON+STATE+COMPLIANCE)

**Crowe LLP**  
Independent Member Crowe Global  

**Audit Committee**  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

**Report on Compliance**  

**Qualified Opinion on State Compliance**  

We have audited San Juan Unified School District’s (the “District”) compliance with the requirements specified in the State of California 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting applicable to the District’s state program requirements identified below for the year ended June 30, 2023.  

In our opinion, except for the noncompliance described in the Basis for Qualified Opinion section of our report, the District complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements that are applicable to the laws and regulations of the state programs noted in the table below for the year ended June 30, 2023.  

**Basis for Qualified Opinion on State Compliance**  

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS), the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Government Auditing Standards), and the 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Our responsibilities under these standards and the 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.  

We are required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the District’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.  

**Matters Giving Rise to Qualified Opinion on State Compliance**  

As described in the accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questions Costs as items 2023-002 and 2023-003, the District did not comply with requirements regard Attendance and Independent Study. Compliance with such requirements is necessary, in our opinion, for the District to comply with the requirements applicable to these programs.  

**Responsibilities of Management for Compliance**  

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the District’s state programs.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the District's compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting will always detect a material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material, if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the District's compliance with the requirements of the state programs as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the District's compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.
- Obtain an understanding of the District’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal controls over compliance. Rather, we express no such opinion.
- Select and test transactions and records to determine the District's compliance with the state laws and regulations applicable to the following items:

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit.

Other Matters

Government Auditing Standards require the auditor to perform limited procedures on the District’s response to noncompliance findings identified in our audit and described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. The District’s responses were not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the responses.

Report on Internal Control over Compliance

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material noncompliance with compliance requirement will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit, we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified.

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of San Juan Unified School District as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise San Juan Unified School District’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated March 15, 2024.

## Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered San Juan Unified School District’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of San Juan Unified School District’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of San Juan Unified School District’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, and therefore material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. We did identify one deficiency in internal control, described in the accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs as Finding 2023-001, that we consider to be a material weakness.

# Report on Compliance and Other Matters

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether San Juan Unified School District's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

## San Juan Unified School District’s Response to Finding

Government Auditing Standards require the auditor to perform limited procedures on San Juan Unified School District’s response to the findings identified in our audit and described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. San Juan Unified School District’s response was not subjected to the other auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response.

## Purpose of this Report

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR THE FIRST 5 SACRAMENTO COUNTY PROGRAM AND REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH A PROGRAM-SPECIFIC AUDIT**  

**Audit Committee**  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

**Report on Compliance**  

**Opinion on First 5 Sacramento County Program**  
We have audited San Juan Unified School District’s compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the Program Guidelines for the First 5 Sacramento County Program that have a direct and material effect on the First 5 Sacramento County Program for the year ended June 30, 2023.  

In our opinion, San Juan Unified School District complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on its First 5 Sacramento County Program for the year ended June 30, 2023.  

**Responsibilities of Management for Compliance**  
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the First 5 Sacramento County Program.  

**Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance**  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the District’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the First 5 Sacramento County Program Guidelines will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the District’s compliance with the requirements of the government program as a whole.

**Crowe LLP**  
Independent Member Crowe Global  

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM; REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AS REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE**  

**Audit Committee**  
San Juan Unified School District  
Carmichael, California  

**Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program**  

**Opinion on Each Major Federal Program**  

We have audited San Juan Unified School District’s compliance with the types of compliance requirements identified as subject to audit in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of San Juan Unified School District’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2023. San Juan Unified School District’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.  

In our opinion, San Juan Unified School District complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2023.  

**Basis for Opinion on Each Major Federal Program**  

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS); the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States Government Auditing Standards; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Our responsibilities under those standards and the Uniform Guidance are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.  

We are required to be independent of San Juan Unified School District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of San Juan Unified School District’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.  

**Responsibilities of Management for Compliance**  

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to San Juan Unified School District’s federal programs.

# Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on San Juan Unified School District's compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material, if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about San Juan Unified School District's compliance with the requirements of each major federal program as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance, we

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding San Juan Unified School District’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
- Obtain an understanding of San Juan Unified School District’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of San Juan Unified School District’s internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no opinion is expressed.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit.

## Report on Internal Control Over Compliance

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified.

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

SECTION II - FINANCIAL STATEMENT FINDINGS

2023-001 MATERIAL WEAKNESS – INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (30000)

**Criteria:** Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of their financial statements, as well as the design, implementation, and maintenance of relevant internal controls to ensure their financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

**Condition:** During the year ended June 30, 2023, Cash in County Treasury account reconciliation for Fund 51 was not prepared in a timely or complete manner. This resulted in an overstatement of the cash balance presented for audit by $26,905,548. A material adjusting entry was necessary to correctly report the Cash in County Treasury balance.

**Effect:** A material adjusting entry was necessary to correctly report the Cash in County balance for the Bond Interest and Redemption Fund.

**Cause:** The District did not establish and/or follow adequate internal control procedures to ensure reporting of accurate cash balances in the Bond Interest and Redemption Fund, to include timely preparation of a reconciliation.

**Recommendation:** The District’s management team should implement necessary internal controls to ensure the accuracy of financial reporting. As part of the monthly and/or annual financial close, a reconciliation of general ledger accounts should be performed to ensure accurate financial reporting.

**Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Action:** Management agrees with auditor’s recommendations. A Cash in County Treasury reconciliation will be prepared for the Bond Interest and Redemption Fund on a timely basis and any necessary adjustments recorded as appropriate.

**Criteria:** Attendance Accounting and Reporting in California Public Schools, Title 5, CCR, Section 401 and 421 (b) and Education Code Section 44809 - Each LEA must develop and maintain accurate and adequate records to support the attendance reported to the State.

**Condition:** While performing absence testing at Sierra Oaks K-8 School, we identified 1 out of 25 absences selected for testing, a student that was identified as sick on the call log but marked present in the attendance reporting system.

**Context:** We performed the audit procedures enumerated in the State of California 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting and identified the finding described above.

**Effect:** The District is not in compliance with Attendance Reporting requirements for the year ended June 30, 2023.

**Cause:** The school site did not establish and follow adequate internal control procedures.

**Fiscal Impact:** Fiscal impact was not calculated as the total overstatement of ADA was 0.01.

**Recommendation and Identification as a Repeat Finding:** This is a repeat finding. We recommend that the District ensure that each school site implements and adheres to internal controls to ensure the accuracy of ADA reported.

**Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Action:** The District will ensure that each school site implements and adheres to internal controls to ensure the accuracy of ADA reported by incorporating professional learning on accurate reporting through the regularly scheduled classified meetings, including school site office staff responsible for attendance and reporting.

<!-- Page 161 -->
# San Juan Unified School District
## New High School Courses for 2024-2025
### Rationale/Background

### Advanced Placement (AP) Physics C - Mechanics (A-G):
AP Physics C: Mechanics is equivalent to a one-semester, calculus-based, college-level physics course, especially appropriate for students planning to specialize or major in physical science or engineering. The course explores topics such as kinematics; Newton’s laws of motion; work, energy, and power; systems of particles and linear momentum; circular motion and rotation; and oscillations and gravitation. Introductory differential and integral calculus is used throughout the course. (“d”) (District)

### Advanced Placement (AP) Pre-Calculus (A-G):
In AP Precalculus, students explore everyday situations using mathematical tools and lenses. Through regular practice, students build deep mastery of modeling and functions, and they examine scenarios through multiple representations. They will learn how to observe, explore, and build mathematical meaning from dynamic systems, an important practice for thriving in an ever changing world. AP Precalculus prepares students for other higher-level mathematics and science courses. The framework delineates content and skills common to college precalculus courses that are foundational for careers in mathematics, physics, biology, health science, social science, and data science. (“c”) (District)

### Art and Ethnic Studies (A-G):
In this Art & Ethnic Studies course, students will develop and cultivate respect, empathy, and solidarity with historically marginalized groups of people reflected in our local demographics (Native Americans, African Americans, Latino/a/x Americans, and Asian & Pacific Islander Americans, among others) through developing Visual Arts including (but not limited to) drawing, painting, collage, murals, photography, public art, and mixed media. This survey course would provide a foundation that future classes could build upon for a more in-depth exploration of art forms in varying cultures and communities. (“f”) (“non a-g”) (Del Campo)

### Data Science (A-G):
In this course, students will learn to understand, ask questions, and represent data through project-based units. The units will give students opportunities to be data explorers through active engagement, developing their understanding of data analysis, sampling, correlation/causation, bias, and uncertainty, modeling with data, making and evaluating data-based arguments, and the importance of data in society. At the end of the course, students will have a portfolio of their data science work to showcase their newly developed knowledge and understanding. The curriculum will be adaptable so that teachers can either use the data sets provided or bring in data sets most relevant to their own students. We will apply for A-G approval of the course, which would mean the course can be taken as an alternative to Algebra 2, or in addition to Algebra 2. (“c”) (Del Campo)

### English 3: Ethnic Studies (A-G):
Students in the English 3 Ethnic Studies course read and analyze a broad range of nonfiction and fiction selections, deepening their awareness of how language works in effectively communicating an idea. Additionally, this course aims to educate students to be civically, socially, and economically conscious through the themes of identity, history and movement, systems of power, and social movements and equity. By studying the historic struggle of communities of color, taking into account the intersectionality of identity, students will develop respect and empathy for individuals and groups of people locally, nationally, and globally to build self-awareness, empathy, and foster active social engagement.

Flyers to share with families and community members explaining how they can review materials were posted at each high school’s front office, in Central Enrollment, in the FACE Mobile, and at the fingerprinting station in the Human Resources Department at the District Office. In addition, a representative from PLI attended several events that families attend in order to advertise the materials adoption. Dates for materials review and attendance at family events were as follows:

| What                | When                               | Where                                         |

**FEEDBACK RESULTS**  

**10. Considering the needs of district students, what are the strengths and limitations of the recommended materials?**  

**Strengths**  
- Substantial amount of authentic material in written and audio forms  
- Sources come from real life situations, interviews, advertisements and include varied accents from around Spanish-speaking countries  
- Each unit is scaffolded into manageable chunks that will ultimately conclude with an end-of-unit assessment  
- Each “TEMA” (theme/topic) has subtopics “CONTEXTOS” that align with AP Spanish Language and Culture course themes. They also allow for a more in-depth understanding of the topics.  
- End of unit assessment and other assessments and activities mirror the skills needed to prepare for the proficiencies required on the AP Exam  

**Limitations**  
- Material and sources can become outdated quickly  
- More differentiation to support student learning differences would be helpful.  
- There is a lot of content--a pacing guide would help best make use of the materials  

**11. What were the results of the evaluation and what are the recommended materials?**  
The teacher evaluated the materials based on the Key Indicators and recommended Temas, 3rd Edition.
