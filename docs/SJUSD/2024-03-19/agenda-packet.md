# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## BOARD OF EDUCATION  
### AGENDA ITEM: G-7  
### MEETING DATE: 03/19/2024  

**SUBJECT:**  
Head Start (HS) and Early Head Start (EHS) Grant Application 2024-2025  

**DEPARTMENT:**  
Early Childhood Education (ECE)  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the submission and implementation of, if funded, the Head Start and Early Head Start Grant 2024-2025.  

---

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The purpose of the annual Head Start and Early Head Start Grant application is to renew funding for the fiscal year 2024-25. Head Start and Early Head Start are comprehensive programs designed to meet the needs of pregnant women and children from infancy through five years of age, including infant, toddler, and preschool programs and the comprehensive services that support all of these groups.

It is important to note the following changes:

For the Early Head Start program year spanning August 1, 2024 – July 31, 2025, the following has resulted in a change to program funding:

Current enrollment trends continue to show long wait lists for the infant and toddler centers. Due to this fact, San Juan Unified will be expanding the number of student slots for the center-based program. Additionally, in order to provide the highest quality home-based program, the home-visitor case load has been decreased from 12 to 10. This will reduce slots by 14; however, funds for supporting this program will remain the same. The program will increase the center-based EHS slots by 16 slots. Because the home-based program will retain funding, 21 Head Start slots will be converted to $201,600 to support the additional center-based programs.

For the Head Start program year spanning August 1, 2024 – July 31, 2025, the following has resulted in a change to program funding:

Beginning in 2019, San Juan Unified School District assumed 376 enrollment slots from Sacramento City Unified School District that the program did not have the capacity to fill. Additionally, the pandemic further impacted enrollment numbers in 2020. In an effort to meet the enrollment, 156 slots were returned to Sacramento City Unified School District with the 2023-2024 grant application. Despite significant recruitment efforts that resulted in a 10% growth in enrollment, the 100% enrollment requirement was not met, leaving five classrooms still closed. The Office of Head Start mandates full enrollment and improved safety and supervision, leading to another cycle of slots being returned to Sacramento City Unified. For the 2024-25 grant application, 176 slots will be returned. However, funding for 91 slots will be retained: $201,600 for Early Head Start and $614,400 for duration classes adopting smaller class sizes.

Please describe what will be offered in 2024-25 program year in the following sections. Please provide justification by citing data from community assessment, school district enrollment trends and availability of other early childhood programs in the communities/neighborhoods served.  

1. **Service and Recruitment Area (1302.11(a) and 1302.13)**  
   - Identify the service and recruitment area (zip codes) for proposed program operations.  
     These are the zip codes that are covered within the boundary lines of the San Juan Unified School District for EHS/HS: 95608, 95610, 95621, 95628, 95662, 95841, 95842, 95864, and 95825  
   - Provide evidence (data) to demonstrate that the proposed area is of greatest need.  
     According to the Sacramento County Community Assessment data there is high need in all of these areas based on the percentage of families receiving SNAP:  
     - 95608 – 58.8%  
     - 95610 – 49.7%  
     - 95621 – 49.6%  
     - 95628 – 46.6%  
     - 95662 – 53.0%  
     - 95841 – 48.3%  
     - 95842 – 69.5%  
     All of these zip codes are currently serving children in the San Juan Unified Head Start program.  

2. **Needs of Children and Families (1302.11(b))**  
   Provide a summary of data from your community assessment that informs the program’s selection criteria and design, such as:  
   - the estimated number of eligible children under five years of age and pregnant women by geographic location, race, ethnicity, and spoken language, including children experiencing homelessness, in foster care, dual language learners, and with disabilities;  
   - data regarding the education, health, nutrition, social service, child care, parent schedules, and other service needs of the proposed children, families, and pregnant women; and  
   - the availability of other child development, child care centers, and family child care programs that serve eligible children, including home visiting, publicly-funded state and local preschools, and the approximate number of eligible children served.  

   In 2024, according to the Sacramento County Community Assessment, the following are estimated number of children under the age of 5: 18,030 are age zero, 18,276 are age one, 19,309 are age two, 18,699 are age three, 19,608 are age four. There are 93,922 age eligible children in the entire county.  

   The county population is estimated to have increased by 1.5% between 2020 and 2023. As the population increases, the diversity of the county continues to grow. The charts below show how.

![Enrollment by Language San Juan vs Sac County](image_url)

San Juan Unified is seeing an influx of refugees coming into the district. The number of Dual Language Learners (DLL) students increased by 11% over the course of one school year. During the 2022-2023 school year San Juan Unified Early Head Start served 194 students that were Dual Language Learners (DLL); 73% of the students in the program. The Head Start program served 528 students that qualified as DLL; 60% of the students overall.

**decreased by 24%. Only 9% students at the end of enrollment (school year) had parent/guardians out of work or not enrolled in any job training or school.**

The San Juan Unified Head Start and Early Head Start are supporting families with their families health needs. In the 2022-2023 school year there were 547 (62%) families with medical homes (homes where families participated in regularly scheduled well-child checks), by the end of enrollment the percentage increased by 20% with 722 families or 82% of families with medical homes. Additional health needs of San Juan Unified students were identified in the 22-23 school year. 138 students had chronic illnesses and 40% of those students had Asthma. 24% of students fell into the obese or overweight category and 8% of the students classified as underweight. 81% of the students received preventative dental care due to yearly dental screenings that are scheduled and that occur in each classroom.

Currently, Head Start follows the traditional school year schedule 6.5 hours of care for students 10 months of the year. Early Head Start programs provides 7 hours of care. Additionally, Early Head Start offers both 10 month and 12 month care. Due to recent data from an Early Head Start parent satisfaction survey in January 2024, there is an increased need for more Early Head Start centers. All infant/toddler centers also have many students on the waitlist, showing further evidence of the need of more EHS centers.

- Explain how the program will measure progress to assure the LDO effectively supports appropriate development and progress in children’s early learning outcomes.  
- Classes that will need Head Start Class-Size Waivers will be listed as LDO.  

Typically, there are three primary reasons that SETA and Delegates utilize class-size waivers:  
1. Head Start-State Preschool Collaboration Classrooms. This class-size waiver permits SETA and Delegates to enroll up to 24 children in Head Start-State collaboration classrooms, including the HS-TK-State partnership. Each class will maintain an 8:1 child-teacher ratio at all times and ensures State preschool/TK children receive Head Start comprehensive services and Head Start children receive extended day services.

PROGRAM NARRATIVE  

2. Inclusion Classrooms for Children with Disabilities. This class size waiver will permit SETA and Delegates to enroll up to 24 children in partnership with the Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) or the district’s Special Education Department to operate full inclusion classes.  

3. Head Start Classrooms That Have Been Capped at 17 Due to Predominantly 3-Year Old Children Enrolled. This class-size waiver permits SETA and Delegates to enroll up to 20 children in classes that have been capped due to a majority of 3-year old enrolled children.  

This waiver would be used under the following circumstances:  
- To accommodate a transitioning EHS child into a Head Start classroom in the same center. In these cases, the waiver is used when an EHS child is aging out at 36 months and is eligible for Head Start services on the same campus but the class is capped at 17. Documentation will be maintained in each child’s file when this option is exercised.  
- To accommodate a transitioning EHS child into a Head Start classroom in an adjacent location. In these cases, the waiver is used when an EHS child is aging out at 36 months and is eligible for Head Start services at the nearest location but the class is capped at 17. Documentation will be maintained in each child’s file when this option is exercised.  
- To accommodate a child with disabilities in a Head Start full-inclusion classroom that has been capped at 17.  

Using the chart below, please provide detailed information on the centers/classes that will require class-size waivers. Please include the class ChildPlus loc id and the number of children in each class.  

Note: Classes with class-size waivers will be listed as an LDO option in the narrative, on Exhibit A-1/ Summary of Federal Funds and on the Program Schedule in HSES.  

Class/classroom with class-size waiver should meet the applicable classroom square footage requirements.  

Any classroom that has received a CCL Type A violation for safety/supervision in the past 12 months is not eligible for a class size waiver.

| Enrollment Slots | 888 | 712 |  

**Summary of Proposed Program Changes in Funding**  

**EHS Home Base**  
Proposal: A reduction of 14 slots to increase quality by decreasing caseloads  
Agreement: San Juan Unified may retain the funding for the equivalent of 14 slots to fund the changes in center-based  
Funding impact: $0 increase or decrease  

**EHS Center Base**  
Proposal: Increase Center Based EHS by 16 slots  
Agreement: Since the funding for the Home Base is being retained for case reductions, a conversion of preschool slots would fund this change  
Funding impact: Convert funding of 21 HS slots to EHS= $201,600  

**HS Reduction**  
Proposal: Reduce HS by 176 slots. This includes closures as well as 4 less slots per duration class to reduce class size to 16 (4 slots in 16 classes = 64 slots)  
Agreement: San Juan Unified may retain the funding of the 64 slots displaced in duration classes to extend duration hours and support quality of smaller class size= $614,400  

**Funds to be retained:**  
21 to converted to EHS= $201,600  
<!-- Page 64 -->
![SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HEAD START / EARLY HEAD START REFUNDING APPLICATION 2024-2025 (YEAR 1 of 5) PROGRAM NARRATIVE](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+not+displayed)

64 to extend duration hours at smaller class size = $614,400  
Total retained = $816,000  

**Rationale for Conversion of Head Start slots to Early Head Start slots**  
The reduction in Head Start slots and increase of Early Head Start slots are due to the community need for more 18 – 36 month slots available for Early Head Start. The 21 Head Start slots that are being converted to EHS are from General Davie. General Davie still has 7 classrooms available for Head Start children and have not been able to fill more than 7 classrooms in 3 years. Head Start children will still receive the resources and access they need in that area, while we meet additional needs of the community with Early Head Start slots. This model meets the needs of infants, toddlers, and pregnant women by providing more openings in Early Head Start care and a supportive network for pregnant women through the EHS Home Based program.

San Juan Unified has been running an effective Early Head Start program for many years and is the only district that serves infants in Sacramento County. Additionally, the 23-24 parent satisfaction survey data showed that when asked how satisfied the families are with the Early Head Start program, 93% were very satisfied and the remaining 7% were satisfied. The parent survey was provided in 5 different languages to ensure all families had a voice.

The teachers in the program are all required to have their Child Development Permit. A majority of teachers also currently have their Site Supervisor Permit or are working towards it. Staff are provided eight full days of training, each year and have monthly site meetings to follow up on training and administrative support needs.

In regards to facilities, 16 student slots will move from San Juan High School to Marvin Marshall Center. Marvin Marshall center will provide an environment that meets all the square footage and safety requirements needed. The additional 16 slots to be added to the program will utilize one of the more updated preschool classrooms at Encina High School. This large room that will be divided into two classrooms and meets the health, safety, and licensing requirements. These classrooms will be set up, license approved, Fire Marshall approved and ready to begin classes by July 1st, 2024.

**5. Centers and Facilities:**

6. Eligibility, Recruitment, Selection, Enrollment, and Attendance (1302.13, 1302.14, 1302.15, and 1302.16):

- Describe specific efforts to actively locate, recruit and enroll vulnerable children, including (1) children with disabilities, (2) children experiencing homelessness and (3) children in foster care.

San Juan Unified has developed: community, intra-district, and county-level partnerships to recruit and enroll vulnerable children. The Special Education Department collaborates on a monthly basis with the Disabilities Content Specialist, and ECE Administrators to continually fill slots and provide needed support for participants with IFSPs/IEPs in our EHS and HS center-based programs. Continuing from the previous year, the district McKinney-Vento Program refers families in transition (i.e., homeless families) who are interested and age-eligible for our EHS and HS programs. We also are in contact with our Foster Youth Services clerk for any referrals. School Community Workers (SCWs) have identified and closely worked with affordable housing complexes in the community to enroll students in nearby classrooms-- some of those families were in transition before moving into the complex. Along with intra-district, and community partnerships, school community workers continue to provide flyers and program information to our county-level partner: Sacramento County of Education (SCOE) Project Teach—a program that “promotes the educational success of children experiencing homelessness” between the ages of 0-5.

- Describe your program’s strategy to promote regular attendance including special efforts for chronically absent children and other vulnerable children.

The first step to addressing chronic absenteeism is to have strong data to analyze from ChildPlus. Center based teachers for EHS and HS use ChildPlus attendance app for parents to digitally sign in/out their children on a daily basis. Parents are taught expectations of attendance from the beginning at orientation to contact classroom staff in they will be absent, and to provide a reason. If children are unexpectedly absent, classroom staff will contact families to learn the reason for absence. With multiple (unexpected) absences outside of illness, teachers reach out to their school community worker as an additional support for outstanding issues. SCWs will call, and may do a well-check home visit, to see if the family needs extra support to get the children in the habit of regularly going to school. If families need extra support or resources that will help with attendance, the SCWs are able to give referrals to the family.

In addition to using data to identify families that may need additional resources to help them get to school, relationship and community building are other ways to make sure families get their children to school. By building an environment that the child feels welcome and excited to come each day, attendance is greatly improved. Teachers work to build relationship with students through various activities in the classroom that incorporate individual student interests. Teachers also connect daily with parents and guardians during drop off and pick up, by greeting them and discussing each child as they arrive and leave. Monthly parent meetings also build community and connection between the teacher and parents and allow for

the parents to get to know one another. By building strong connection and relationship, attendance improves.

## 7. Education and Child Development (1302 Subpart C)  
### Center-based program:  
- Identify the curriculum(a) your program will use including, if applicable, curricular enhancements and/or significant adaptations.

**EHS**  
San Juan Unified will continue to use *The Creative Curriculum for Infants, Toddlers and Twos* as the primary curriculum, which has a SEL component. No enhancements or significant adaptations are planned at this time, only minor adaptations to the format of the lesson plans to fit the needs of the program.

**HS**  
San Juan Unified will continue to use *The Creative Curriculum Studies* as the primary curriculum, and will continue to use *Second Step* as the supplemental Social Emotional Learning (SEL) curriculum. No enhancements or significant adaptations are planned at this time, though both will have materials refreshed and more in-depth staff training as needed.

- Describe how each identified curriculum is appropriate for ages and background of children served, research-based, and has an organized developmental scope and sequence.

**EHS**  
*The Creative Curriculum for Infants, Toddlers and Twos* curriculum uses research-proven strategies to support developmentally appropriate skills for young children in group care. All Intentional Teaching Cards, which are included with the curriculum materials and listed in the curriculum’s Teacher Guides, have a Teaching Sequence that supports the adjustment of activities to match development and to scaffold for young learners, including Dual Language Learners and children with special needs. In addition, both the Mighty Minutes, Highlight Hello instructional cards, and Learning Games have suggestions for doing the activities with a range of developmental levels for children under 3.

**HS**

PROGRAM NARRATIVE  

including Dual Language Learners and children with special needs.

The Second Step Early Learning SEL curriculum is designed to be used with diverse children ages 4-5 years, incorporating short daily lessons under weekly themes across five units of study. Each week’s SEL learning builds upon previous knowledge and skills, and incorporates visual lesson cards, active learning and practice, and age-appropriate role play, puppets, and music. The scope and sequence emphasize weekly concepts and objectives that support social-emotional competence and skill-building in preschool-aged children.

- Describe how chosen curriculum is aligned with the Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework: Ages Birth to Five.

EHS  
Materials and activities in The Creative Curriculum for Infants, Toddlers and Twos are aligned with the Head Start Early Learning Outcomes framework, using similar developmental domains including social-emotional, language, and physical development skills. Each piece of the curriculum is attached to the exact section of the ELOF in the following document.

HS  
Study materials and activities in The Creative Curriculum Studies curriculum are aligned with the Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework (ELOF), using the same or very similar developmental domains common to many early childhood frameworks and curricula, including social-emotional, cognitive and physical development skills.

- Identify the developmental screenings and assessments your program plans to use and why, including how the program addresses screening and assessment for children who are dual language learners.

EHS  
The developmental screening tool used by San Juan Unified Early Head Start is the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) series. This set of questionnaires is completed based on age in months, with adjustments made for premature birth. Families and teachers work together to complete the first screening set, which measures developmental (ASQ-3) and behavioral milestones (ASQ-2 SE). This set is completed during the primary home visit using a paper form, and interpretation is scheduled as needed to accommodate home language needs.

Results are generated by scoring the completed tool, and any score outside of the typical range of development indicates a need for additional screening. Families and children complete subsequent screeners in sequence until the child shows age-level growth of skill or further assessment is indicated. All families are provided home language interpretation for each screening. ASQ results are valid up to three school years if a child shows typical scoring.

Early Head Start teachers use the Desired Results Developmental Profile (DRDP) assessment tool to track and monitor developmental and behavioral growth. The DRDP documentation serves as our assessment tool when tracking a child’s development. This information is shared with families using the Learning Genie communication portal, which translates information to the family’s home language. All completed screening and assessment results are logged into the Child Plus data system for reference and tracking.

HS

The developmental screening tool used by San Juan Unified Head Start is the Ages and Stages Questionnaire series (ASQ). This set of questionnaires is completed based on age in months, with adjustments made for premature birth. Upon completing the enrollment process, families will complete the ASQ-3 and ASQ-2 SE during their in-person screening appointment. On-site interpretation is provided for families if the ASQ tool is not available in the home language. All ASQ responses are entered digitally and are processed and recorded by the Inclusion Content Specialist/support staff.

Results are generated by scoring the completed tool, and any score outside the typical range of development indicates a need for additional screening. The child’s teacher is provided with all screening results and is given the opportunity to review referral forms as needed. Children who are dual language learners are provided an extended timeline of referral for any speech-related documentation, up to 90 days, along with the assistance of a Bilingual Instructional Assistant (BIA). All DRDP documentation for children in Head Start is recorded in the language used by the child, and parents are provided results and feedback in their home language.

- Describe how your program will support staff to implement curriculum with fidelity.

EHS

Staff will receive Education training at the start of each new school year, with additional training throughout the school year. New teachers will be introduced to the curriculum with a series of one-on-one or small group trainings. Lesson plans and action plans will be reviewed periodically, and coaching needs to support curriculum implementation will be determined for individual teaching staff, with coaching to be provided by TOSAs and Content Specialists as appropriate, using a Practice-Based Coaching approach.

HS

Education and Inclusion Content Specialists will facilitate a coaching cohort of preschool and infant/toddler TOSAs, who are the first line of support for implementation. The coaching cohort will use a Practice-Based Coaching approach, drawing from Teaching Pyramid, ECLKC, and other coaching resources to support the group with implementation to fidelity. Teaching staff will receive annual Education training at the start of each new school year, and Education-focused Professional Development (PD) will be offered during the school year. Lesson plans and action plans will be reviewed periodically.

Home-based program:

- **Identify the home-based curriculum(a) your program will use including, if applicable, curricular enhancements and/or significant adaptations**  
  San Juan Unified will continue to use Parents as Teachers (PAT) as the primary curriculum for our families that have children enrolled in our EHS home based program. For pregnant mothers enrolled in the program teachers will utilize resources and information from both PAT and Partners for a Healthy Baby. Adaptations to the PAT lesson plans were instituted when the program initially began utilizing the PAT curriculum. The program regularly works with teaching staff to adapt the planning forms to best fit the needs of both the families and educators. Teaching staff may use additional resources from Partners for a Healthy Baby to supplement activities and parent resources from the primary PAT curriculum.

- **Describe how each curriculum is appropriate for ages and background of children served, research-based, promotes the parent’s role as the child’s teacher including, as appropriate, the family’s traditions, culture, values, and beliefs, and has an organized developmental scope and sequence, and how it is aligned with the Head Start Early Learning Outcomes Framework: Ages Birth to Five.**  
  The Parents as Teachers Foundational Curriculum (PAT) curriculum specifies ways to engage with diverse families and children who are culturally responsive including, but not limited to, the resources entitled “Three steps to Cultural Competence” and “Human Diversity, Cultural Competence, and Parent Education”. Handouts and information are broken down into age categories for sharing with families. Some materials and handouts are available in a variety of languages through the Parents as Teachers website that can be printed and given to families. After the initial eight foundational visits, that establish a relationship between teacher and parent/caregiver, all follow up visits are planned in conjunction with the families to meet their individual needs.

- **Describe how your program will support staff to implement the curriculum.**  
  Teachers have received online training in the Parents as Teachers (PAT) curriculum, and new teachers will be enrolled to receive training. Support staff have been trained in the curriculum to be able to support the teachers, open discussions on what is working and what the teachers need support with happen at monthly staff meetings. The program will also work to partner with other Early Head Start home visiting programs to expand a system of support, and continued training.

- **Identify the developmental screenings and assessments your program plans to use and why, including how the program addresses screening and assessment for children who are dual language learners.**

Home-Based teachers assess children’s developmental and cognitive skills using the HELP assessment three times a year, Fall, Winter, and Spring. Also, parents are asked to complete the ASQ and ASQ-SE screening tools, starting with the 45-day screening at enrollment, and continuing until the child ages out of the program at 3 years old. Teaching staff score the ASQs and review findings with families to determine whether additional screeners or referrals for services will be required. All children in the EHS program are considered language learners, and support is given to families in the form of translated materials and oral translation when available.

- **Describe group socializations to be offered.**

Socializations are offered twice a month. There is a classroom located on the east side of the district and one on the west side that is set up for experiences similar to those children would experience in a classroom, where children can explore, and parents can connect with each other. Parent meetings will be held at these “Family Days” so information and resources can be shared. A School Community Worker is also available at socializations for additional questions and support.

8. **Health (1302 Subpart D)**

- **Describe how your program will, in partnership with parents, meet the oral health, nutritional, and mental health and social and emotional well-being, and health status and care needs of children that are developmentally, culturally, and linguistically appropriate and support each child’s growth and school readiness.**

All health/nutritional histories, physical exams/well child checks, dental exams, and immunization records are reviewed for all students. Health forms are provided in multiple languages and interpreting services utilized as needed. Health screening events are held throughout the summer and weekly during the school year, with accommodations made based on family needs. Our screening process includes, but is not limited to, obtaining height, weight, vision, hearing, blood pressure, and hemoglobin. The Credentialed School Nurse is available for consult, education, and anticipatory guidance if needed.

- **Describe how your program will ensure up-to-date child health status, ongoing care, and timely follow-up care.**

San Juan Unified, in conjunction with parents and community partnerships, works to ensure all children are up to date for preventative care according to the current pediatric periodicity table in both health and dental areas. If there is any area where a child is not up to date, the parent is given education, resources, or other assistance as needed, in preferred language if available or through the use of the interpreter line. The child’s status is tracked in the Child Plus software system and by

health assistants. Reminder calls, letters, emails, and other resources are sent to the caregivers if a child is not up to date. The health team follows up with any students that have abnormal screening results. For any student that has a special health need, a Health Care Plan is created and put in place; classroom staff are trained by the nurse on the needs of the student. The health team works in collaboration with SETA and the Health Services Advisory Committee to find solutions for any challenges in receiving preventative screenings within the community.

- For mental health and social and emotional well-being, describe how a program will provide mental health consultation services in partnership with staff and family

San Juan Unified has a mental health therapist who works closely with parents, teachers, and support staff. The mental health therapist provides parent workshops throughout the year and attends many parent teacher conferences to discuss support for student behavior. In addition, he provides training at staff meetings to help teachers understand how to provide moral support to families who are experiencing trauma.

**9. Family and Community Engagement (1302 Subpart E)**  
Please address for both center-based and home-based programs.  
- Describe key program strategies for building trusting and respectful relationships with families and for providing program environments and services that are welcoming and culturally and linguistically responsive to families, including those specific to fathers.

San Juan Unified is building trusting and respectful relationships with families starting with the registration and enrollment process. Admission and Family Support Technicians (AFSTs) meet with families for as long as it takes to help them with all the paperwork they need to register. During screening parents connect with a School Community Worker (SCW) who reviews their needs and interests with them and supports them with any emergency needs. Health staff provide helpful information to families regarding creating medical homes and a staff member helps the parent or guardian complete the ASQ. San Juan Unified has an open door policy and invites families to volunteer in the classrooms. Families are encouraged to share their cultural customs. Training is also provided for teachers in cultural awareness through the San Juan Unified Equity Department. Teachers create welcoming environments and provide resources that families can easily access in the Parent Family Community Engagement (PFCE) binder. San Juan Unified provides resources in families' home languages. Additionally, there is a Language Line or SCRA if teachers need help translating a parent conference or need assistance with communicating with parents. Bilingual Instructional Assistants (BIAs) are available to the classrooms to help children feel welcomed in their own language and to help teachers communicate with parents. The Spring Community Event focuses on male involvement, where children bring important males in their life to learn soccer skills taught by professional community soccer players. Finally, one SCW and the Family Engagement Content attend the Family and Fathers International/National Conference and always bring back new strategies for engaging fathers.

- Describe engagement activities to support parent-child relationships, child development, family literacy, and language development including supporting bilingualism and bi-literacy.

San Juan Unified holds an annual Fall Language and Literacy festival each October where current and potential families across the district are invited to participate. There are many resources available for families, such as food boxes, healthy snacks, and infant supplies. Families are provided with free materials such as children’s books in multiple languages and clothing in a variety of sizes. Families can participate in community age-appropriate activities such as games, a dance party, face painting, arts and crafts, picking a pumpkin at the pumpkin patch, and taking family pictures in the pumpkin patch. A librarian hosted story time on the grass and Kona Ice was invited as a treat for the students and families in order share information about Head Start to local businesses. The San Juan Unified School District Family And Community Engagement (FACE) department also had their resource mobile with resources to support families such as upcoming FACE events as well as giveaways.

Additionally, Home-visitors bring books once a week to share with their families. In the EHS centers, parents are encouraged to take books home and read to their children. Books are also read in the classroom to children throughout the day. In the HS programs, story time is integrated into the daily schedule and a library center is utilized every day, where children can explore books with each other, on their own, or with an adult.

Bilingualism and bi-literacy are supported by our BIAs who are able to support students and families in their native languages and read with students in the classrooms.

- **How are you utilizing ReadyRosie to engage families?**

Families are introduced and signed up for Ready Rosie at their classroom orientation. A Content Specialist helps with orientations and demonstrates how Ready Rosie works so that families can see all the benefits of the program. The Content Specialist creates the classrooms and gets the monthly Child Plus report to upload new families to their classrooms. The Content Specialist checks the pending invites monthly and makes sure the invites are resent if they are pending. The Content Specialist ensures newly enrolled families are uploaded to their Ready Rosie classroom monthly. Families receive weekly videos as well as additional videos sent by the Content Specialist.

- **What are your program strategies for family partnership services, including conducting the family assessment and family partnership (FPA) process and aligning activities to the Parent, Family, and Community Engagement Framework outcomes (PFCE)?**

In order to ensure all family needs are met the FPA process occurs during the screening process before the family starts in the program. Families come through the office and are able to individually complete the FPA process with a SCW. During this process the family is able to identify any emergency needs they may have and additional resources they would like to receive in the future. This process is part of the enrollment process and ensures that no family is missed when beginning the program. After the initial FPA process is completed the SCWs follow up with any needs and help the families create goals for the year. In an effort to reach all families the SCWs use a variety of communication strategies such as texting, emailing, phone calls, and in person meetings. By individualizing the communication method according to what each family prefers, the SCW is working to build a trusting relationship and make sure that families’ needs are being met. The SCWs work directly with the teachers and Family Engagement Content Specialist to make sure that appropriate resources are provided to parents for each month. A schedule has been created by the Content Specialist to make sure all the PFCE outcomes are covered throughout the year. The SCWs also present on various topics during the Policy Committee meetings. San Juan Unified always works to communicate with families in their preferred language by using SCWs, teaching staff, BIAs, SCRAs, and language line. Families receive resources about events that are happening in the community as well as health and wellness resources. SCWs work with families throughout the year to align their goals with the PFCE outcomes provide resources to make sure they are set up and empowered to achieve their goals.

- How do you track progress toward individual family goals and needs?

Family Goals are tracked electronically through a Google form and Child Plus. The Google form is uploaded to Child Plus as an event and updates on the event are provided throughout the year. SCWs continually follow up with families and their goals, which allows families to continue to self-reflect to see if they need additional support or need to shift their goals to better meet their family needs. In the EHS Home based program, families discuss goals during their weekly visits and the family goals are integrated into the visit plans that the visitor and parent build collaboratively.

- Provide a few examples of community partnerships that facilitate access to services or resources in the community that are responsive to FAMILY partnership goals and children’s needs. Identify any challenges to necessary partnerships and how the program plans to address those challenges.

San Juan Unified is partnering with SCOE’s Project Teach, which assists the 0-5 ages that are experiencing housing insecurities. The Content Specialist and SCWs are part of the monthly meetings that Project Teach 0-5 puts on to help our families that may be experiencing housing insecurity. These meetings provide us with resources to support our families. San Juan Unified ECE is also working with the San Juan Unified Intervention/Prevention Attendance Improvement and the Families and Community Engagement (FACE) departments. SCWs are providing assistance at attendance support meetings for San Juan families and two content specialists have attended and participated in numerous FACE events for families. The Kiwanis volunteer organization is also a partner with San Juan Unified and has supported multiple community events through volunteers and donations.

Additional community partnerships San Juan Unified Head Start works with are:

### PROGRAM NARRATIVE  

## 10. Services for Children with Disabilities (1302 Subpart F)  

- Describe how your program will ensure the full participation in program services and activities for enrolled children with disabilities, including but not limited to those who are eligible for services under IDEA and those who already have an IFSP or IEP.  

EHS-  
San Juan Unified Infant and Toddler programs provide ongoing documentation of each child’s development, both in the home and in our center-based programs. Using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ 3 and ASQ 2 SE) series, center-based and home based teachers will routinely screen child progress with families, in addition to collecting observational data, family reporting, and relevant medical appointment feedback. Each child’s growth will also be assessed by support staff, using the same tools as needed for identifying best practices for each student. Any child displaying developmental markers below the threshold of the assessment tool will be monitored on a more frequent basis, and families will be provided all results. Families will determine how any concerns will be addressed, including but not limited to: continuing to monitor development while providing individualized lesson planning to support areas of concern, meeting with support staff (Teacher On Special Assignment (TOSA), content specialists, peer teachers, etc.) for collaboration on activities, tracking developmental observations for a medical provider, and/or referral to an outside agency for assessment and possible services with the creation of an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP).  

Center-based teachers will report each family’s choice of action with the Inclusion Content Specialist, Health team members, Mental Health Specialist and any other relevant support staff, with the written permission of each family. The support staff will then begin to build relationships with our collaborating agencies, including but not limited to Alta California Regional Center, Sacramento County Office of Education, and Elika Health Services. Families will determine what type of information sharing will be implemented using written consent and transition meetings. Many services offered by the collaborating agencies will be offered within the family home or another community environment. Services may be provided within the center-based setting when this arrangement is in the best interests of the child. Consultation and coaching for teaching staff will be provided by the coordinating agency and the Inclusion Content Specialist as needed. All relevant documentation of services, goals, etc. will be kept separate from general child portfolios with confidentiality protocols in place at all times.  

Children transitioning from our home-based to our center-based EHS locations will be provided an individual timeline of enrollment to maintain consistency for the family, increase their access to individualized education and allow maximum attention to the identification of the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE) based on their level of needed supports. Children transitioning from our center-based EHS programs into a HS classroom will be placed in a similar manner. Families will meet with their transition team (Current teacher(s), case manager from their service provider, appropriate support staff, and assigned HS classroom teacher when possible) to address the timeline for continued services, needed assessments, adjusted goals and tentative start date. All children with IFSPs will be transitioned and enrolled based on their individual needs.

need and LRE determination, with attention placed upon family input, preference and need.

When children currently enrolled in our EHS programs are identified as needing developmental support, but do not qualify for an IFSP or comparable service arrangements, the Inclusion Content Specialist, Mental Health Specialist and TOSA will provide teaching staff with lesson planning guidance, feedback on strategy documentation/implementation and family connections with additional support (Family Engagement Content Specialist, School Community workers, Family and Community Engagement team, etc.). As children transition from EHS to a HS placement the current teacher will provide all relevant documentation, strategies, and observations to the HS teaching staff prior to the child’s start date. This will ensure a continuum of care and support for the child’s success in their new environment.

HS- SJUSD ECE inclusion preschool programs currently include 28 slots reserved for children enrolling with affirmed IEPs. Each of the six identified classrooms have one general education teacher, one supporting special education teacher, one full-time Child-Development Assistant (CDA) and one full day Instructional Aide (IA). These inclusion slots are reserved for students whose least restrictive environment has been documented as a general education classroom with a shared IA within the full day program. This placement is included within the child’s current

Children enrolled in a designated inclusion placement have mild to moderate needs, with modifications or accommodations that can be effectively met in a full day, play based environment. Educational categories may include, but are not limited to, autism spectrum disorder, speech delay, physical impairments, or other cognitive delays. The special education teacher and IA will be in the classroom to work with the inclusion students on meeting their IEP goals and help build children’s school readiness skills. The additional staff will lower the teacher-child ratio in identified inclusion classrooms.

Children enrolled in all SJUSD ECE classrooms are screened and monitored throughout the year for developmental and behavioral growth. During the registration process a family member completes the Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ 3 and ASQ 2 SE) to share their child’s current skills, with notation of strengths and concerns they observe. Physical exams are also required for each child, in which their physician may note additional information regarding development.

Most services for preschool children are provided on site, during scheduled class time. Families may choose to provide additional services off site, or a student may attend a specialized program within the district. Children enrolled in multiple placements, with an affirmed IEP, will be provided transportation between services to provide minimum impact to family schedules and maximum access to all environments throughout the school day. In-classroom services are logged and submitted monthly to the Inclusion Content Specialist. The Monthly Special Education Update form is completed by the general education classroom teacher each month then submitted to the Inclusion Content Specialist. This form lists children enrolled with IEPs, children in the process of referral and the outcome as screenings s and assessments are

performed. Off-site services are reported to the Inclusion Content Specialist on an “as needed” basis, when the child’s general education program schedule does not align with their off-site schedule.

In the event a child is identified as Does Not Qualify (DNQ) for services and goals or does not qualify to be screened for developmental needs under an educational category, the support staff will transition to alternate support for the child, family, and teaching staff. The Inclusion Content Specialist will consult with the Special Education Preschool team to offer the following options: implementing a 504 plan accommodating specific needs, coordinating family meetings to provide materials and strategies to bring school and home environments, facilitating the creation of a Behavior Support Plan (BSP) to address specific challenges the child experiences in the classroom and working with the Health team to rule out medical impacts to a child’s success at home and in the classroom.

- Describe how your program will ensure the individualized needs of children with disabilities are met, including how the program will collaborate with and help parents in the process and how the program will coordinate and collaborate with the local agency responsible for implementing IDEA.

EHS-
During the registration and enrollment process, the Health team and enrollment technicians will review all paperwork submitted by families, communicating to the Inclusion Content Specialist when a child has been identified with a developmental concern. ASQ screening results will be reviewed and discussed with the family at the first home visit, with a plan identified for next steps: observe and document until the next milestone screening, referral to a collaborating agency or referral for additional medical review. Children will be provided with lesson planning that is tailored to their developmental profiles, with frequent documentation of successful strategies, areas of continuing need and activities provided for families to implement in the home environment. Families will be provided with frequent opportunities for community resources in support of development, opportunities to review their child’s progress as needed and guidance in identifying interventions that best meet their needs.

Families moving through the developmental assessment process work closely with their home or classroom teacher, their School Community Worker and other support staff as needed. Our Family and Community Engagement department collaborates with local advocacy and community support agencies to offer support to families as needed. At any time, our Mental Health Specialist is available for family meetings, classroom observations or consultation of support services. Children will remain in their current placement and schedule, with individualized support unless alternative supports are requested and/or agreed to by the family during this process.

Family rights are reviewed during orientation for all EHS programs in SJUSD, specifically rights relating to all collaborating Special Education and Mental Health Support services. Families are provided the opportunity to sign an observation permission form at enrollment/orientation allowing support staff to enter classrooms with the focus on supporting.

the entire enrolled group and the professional development of the teaching team. Children will not be screened, assessed, provided individual interventions, or removed from the daily routine of the classroom without the written understanding and permission of the family.

HS-  
San Juan Unified Special Education program managers and San Juan Unified ECE administrators, TOSAs and Inclusion Content Specialist meet bi-monthly to discuss needs within the designated inclusion classrooms, discuss needs for supporting children enrolled within general education classrooms who display developmental differences and plan for professional development and training needed for staff. All preschool general education teachers are invited to the IEP meetings with written permission from the family. When a teacher cannot attend after invitation, they will be able to give input through a feedback questionnaire on the child’s strengths and any areas of concern within the classroom. The Inclusion Content Specialist is available to attend all IEPs for child, family and classroom support. Teachers will individualize for all students within the classroom, incorporating IEP goals, 504 accommodations and specific developmental strategies as needed per child. Documentation will be submitted to the Education and Inclusion Content Specialists on a quarterly timeline and will be referenced in each child’s Desired Results Developmental Profile online portfolio (DRDP). Parents will be offered four individual opportunities for discussing their child’s development, consisting of two home visits and two family conferences. The first home visit will share the ASQ 3 and ASQ 2 SE results from registration screening and reviewed by the classroom teacher. The second home visit will focus on transition in one of three ways: re-enrolling with a Head Start classroom, enrolling in a Transitional Kindergarten program (TK) or enrolling in a Kindergarten program. If a family will be remaining within the district each child is provided with a digital articulation summary questionnaire that will be submitted to their next classroom teacher. Children moving to a program outside of SJUSD will be provided with their DRDP portfolio documentation as a digital file for the family to use as needed.

During the school year children can be referred for a developmental screening when needed. Our Speech and Language Pathologists (SLPs) are available on each HS campus to receive screening referral forms signed by families with the classroom teacher. Screenings take place during the scheduled classroom times and are logged on the Disability Services Log (DIS). In the event a child is identified with a delay in communication the SLP will initiate a process of enrolling the child with San Juan Unified Central Enrollment. Families will be provided with the screening results and offered two options, a referral for a comprehensive speech assessment or a referral for a full team developmental assessment. A speech assessment will focus on a child’s ability to engage in expressive and receptive communication and is conducted by the site SLP, with support from additional SLP support staff as needed. A full team assessment may include a variety of SJUSD specialists: Special Education Preschool teacher, Occupational Therapist, Adaptive Physical Education teacher, School Psychologist, etc.

With the agreement of the family, the child will be added to a tracking spread sheet with our

Central Enrollment team and the SLP will work with our School Community workers and classroom teacher to support the family in completing district enrollment. Families will submit proof of residence within SJUSD, following district requirements, and will then be contacted by the Special Education assessment coordinator to sign an assessment plan. Appropriate assessment timelines are rigorously followed, and families are provided frequent communication during the process.

Families moving through the developmental assessment process work closely with their classroom teacher, their School Community worker and other support staff as needed. Our Family and Community Engagement department collaborates with local advocacy and community support agencies to offer support to families as needed. Our Mental Health Specialist is available for family meetings, classroom observations or consultation of support services. Children will remain in their current placement and schedule, with individualized support, unless alternative supports are requested and/or agreed to by the family during this process.

Family rights are reviewed during orientation for all HS programs in SJUSD, specifically rights relating to all Special Education and Mental Health Support services. Families are provided the opportunity to sign an observation permission form at enrollment/orientation allowing support staff to enter classrooms with the focus on supporting the entire enrollment and professional development of the teaching team. Children will not be screened, assessed, provided individual interventions or removed from the daily routine of the classroom without the written understanding and permission of the family.

11. Transitions (1302 Subpart G)

- Describe strategies and practices to support successful transitions in:
  i. Transitions to and from Early Head Start;

Transitions from EHS Home Based to Center Based: When an EHS slot in a center becomes available, the Home-Based students take priority. The Admissions and Family Services Tech (AFST) first checks the waitlists for any Home-based students. An additional contact to the home-based teachers serving families in that area is made to see if any families may not be on the waitlist but have shared an interest in putting their child in a center. If the child is ready, the Home-Based Teacher (HBT) works with the AFST and the Health Assistant (HA) to ensure that all paperwork has been completed. The SCW and, when possible, the Home-Based teacher attends the parent orientation led by the center-based teacher when all paperwork has been finalized and confirmed by the AFST. Additionally, the Home-Based Teacher visits the child in the center to check in on how they are doing and the SCW checks in with families to follow up with family needs and goals.

Transitions from EHS Home Based or Center Based to HS Preschool: San Juan Unified continues to utilize the internal “Transition Plan to Preschool” with teachers and families to ensure that the parents understand the process and their options for care. The plan begins when students are 30 months old and families select the Head Start classroom of choice. They are added to the

**PROGRAM NARRATIVE**

waitlist for that classroom 3 months before they turn 36 months. The Transition Plan is aligned with grantee policy and Head Start Program Performance Standards (HSPPS). It ensures all efforts have been made to transfer EHS students into the HS program. If spots are open at other sites, families on waitlists are offered enrollment at the open site. The AFSTs, teachers, and family communicate to determine if other locations or programs will be acceptable to the families, if the first choice is not available.

ii. **Transitions from Head Start to kindergarten; and**  
To ensure HS children have a smooth transition into kindergarten, the Education and Disabilities Content Specialists have continuous collaboration with the Elementary Early Learning TOSAs. In addition to all the school readiness preparation that is done in the classroom this assures strong calibration between preschool and kindergarten classrooms. Transition resources are updated and shared with teachers and families to prepare for transition to kindergarten. School Community Workers also support families individually with any needs they have during the transition process. The May classroom parent meeting is focused on kindergarten transitions and the May Policy Committee meeting also provides a presentation on best practices for parents preparing their children for kindergarten. Individualized Student Articulation Cards are created by preschool teachers and passed on to the TK teachers, kindergarten teachers, and elementary principals to inform them of the preschooler’s progress.

iii. **Transitions between programs.**  
San Juan Unified supports families that are transitioning into different programs by meeting with families and providing resources about transitioning, enrollment, and giving them the information about new program they will be enrolling in. There are resources available that SCWs share with families when they meet with them. San Juan Unified AFSTs and SCWs work collaboratively with SETA to make referrals, check space availability, and support the transition process.

12. Services to Enrolled Pregnant Women (1302 Subpart H)

FOR EHS PROGRAMS ONLY

- Describe how your program facilitates access to a source of ongoing care for enrolled pregnant women that do not have existing access to such care.

Pregnant women enrolled in the San Juan Unified Early Head Start Home-Based Program receive information from their Home-Based Teachers (HBT) and/or health staff about accessible health care, and health-related community resources and events. If they do not have existing access to care, follow up by the HBT and referrals to care providers are provided as needed to ensure primary health care. The program emphasizes to mothers, fathers, partners, and other relevant family members the importance of ensuring they have their own healthcare providers and assists parents in obtaining health care services. The Health Team reviews prenatal history, nutrition screening for pregnant or lactating women, post-delivery information, and refer families to community service agencies as needed.

- Describe your program’s strategy to provide prenatal and postpartum information, education, and services such as those that address fetal development, nutrition, risks of postpartum recovery, and infant care and safe sleep practices.

Prenatal and postpartum education is provided for families starting at the Early Head Start Orientation for all newly enrolled pregnant parents through a specific set of orientation materials that covers the required topics. In addition, HBTs provide prenatal and postpartum information and education for all expectant mothers and families through a research-based curriculum, Parents as Teachers (PAT) and supplementary activity-focused materials from Partners for a Healthy Baby (PHB) which both address important topics such as: improved prenatal health, healthy birth outcomes, bonding and attachment, positive parenting, enhanced child health and development, fetal development, brain development, nutrition, the risks of alcohol and drug use, postpartum recovery, and infant care and safe sleep practices. Families are offered a newborn visit with the School Nurse, and visits are scheduled within the first two weeks after an infant’s birth to offer support and identify family needs. As needed, the HBT refers families to community agencies for car seat classes and low-cost car seat assistance. HBT provides home visits and resources to enrolled prenatal and postnatal mothers, fathers, partners, and other relevant family members. One of the resources included in the home visit is a postpartum depression screening. Socialization events that support the social-emotional well-being of the family, promote responsive caregiving, and support father engagement, are held regularly.

![SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HEAD START / EARLY HEAD START REFUNDING APPLICATION 2024-2025 (YEAR 1 of 5) PROGRAM NARRATIVE](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SAN+JUAN+UNIFIED+SCHOOL+DISTRICT+HEAD+START+%2F+EARLY+HEAD+START+REFUNDING+APPLICATION+2024-2025+%28YEAR+1+of+5%29+PROGRAM+NARRATIVE)

- Describe how your program’s family partnership services includes a focus on factors that influence prenatal and postpartum maternal and infant health, includes other relevant family members, and support the transition process.

HBTs engage the enrolled pregnant women and other relevant family members in discussion of important factors that influence maternal and infant health while using curriculum and supplementary resources to promote and support positive outcomes. In addition, the Home-Based Teachers review the various program options and support services for the newborn with the pregnant mom and other relevant family members as part of the FPA goal-setting process. As needed, the HBTs consult with the SCWs to provide additional resources and services that promote maternal and infant health. This accommodates the individualized needs of the family and ensures that the newborn receives enriching early child development services and the family has the support services necessary to promote healthy family development.

Section B – Governance, Organizational and Management Structures  
Governance Structure (45 CFR Part 1301 and Section 642(c)-(d) in the Act):  
In this section, describe the governance, organizational, and management structures that support quality services and maintain accountability, efficiency, and leadership within your program.  
1. Governance (1301.2(b)(2) and 1301.3(c)(2))  
Governing Body and Policy Council  
- Describe how the governing body and the policy council receive key program information as outlined in 1301.2(b)(2) to inform their ongoing responsibilities including how decisions submitted by the policy council are incorporated into the decision-making process.  
  - Describe the process for communication with the governing board and policy council.

San Juan Unified is a delegate agency of SETA and therefore has a policy committee instead of a policy council. In addition, the School Board that oversees San Juan Unified LEA is also the governing board to the San Juan Unified Head Start program. Policy committee meetings are made up of parent representatives from each classroom in the Head Start Program. One representative is elected as the Chair of the policy committee. A secretary, Co-chair, treasurer, and parliamentarian are also elected and become the executive committee. The executive committee meets the week before the policy committee meeting to approve the agenda and review previous meeting minutes. Once the agenda is approved, an agenda packet is sent out to all policy committee members the week before the meeting. The agenda packet contains the agenda, previous meeting minutes, informational items, fiscal reports, enrollment reports, content reports, and parent resources. Policy committee members review the agenda packet before the monthly meeting. During the meeting members discuss and vote on action items, listen to program reports and various informational presentations and have many opportunities for feedback and questions about the program.

After the policy committee meeting is adjourned a policy committee meeting packet is made for each School Board member. The packets are delivered to the School Board office and timestamped, the same day as the policy committee meeting, so there is no time lapse in information received. Each School Board member packet contains the agenda, the approved minutes from the previous month, fiscal reports, enrollment reports, and content reports, as well as the current month’s agenda. As a

- Describe other key processes to ensure the governing body maintains effective ongoing oversight of program operations and accountability for federal funds.
  - Describe training and technical assistance or orientation sessions for the governing body, advisory committee members, and the policy council.

Once a year an orientation training for Head Start Policy committee members and governing body members is held via zoom. If they are unable to attend, training materials are sent out to members. A welcome packet is also given to all incoming policy committee members; this includes much of the information included in the orientation training. Additionally, refresher trainings are completed throughout the year if new members continue to join after the orientation training opportunity is provided.

  - Include examples of the governing body and policy council using key program information to conduct its responsibilities.

The Governing Body and Policy Committee apply their knowledge from the monthly reports to inform their decisions when approving various budget items and the yearly grant application.

  - Include examples of parent committees informing program policies, activities, and services.

When program changes are being considered, the program design committee meets and reviews the program changes to offer feedback and perspective from the parent community. The parents from the program design committee share at the policy committee meeting what was discussed at the program design meeting. Input is considered and the administration works to include parent needs into all program design decisions. Policy committee members also support the program by taking the yearly parent satisfaction survey before it is sent out to the broader community. This allows the program to get feedback on the survey tool before distributing the survey to all parents. Feedback from all parent surveys is considered for program decisions. One example of a continuous request from parents both on surveys and during policy committee meetings was to increase the number of EHS slots. Changes have been made for the 24-25 school year to expand the toddler programs, based on this request. Also, in the new business section of the policy committee meeting, parents bring forward concerns that they would like more information. These concerns are then created as items for follow up on the next meetings agenda. Reoccurring topics that have come up have been nutrition, field trips, and enrollment efforts. As a result, the head of the nutritional services department presented at a Policy Committee meeting and addressed the questions and concerns of the policy committee members. Parents also have the choice to serve on hiring panels and help choose the best candidates for various positions in Head Start and Early Head Start. Finally, drafts of the self-assessment document and the five-year goals for the program are shared with the policy committee meeting to provide additional revisions, feedback, and suggestions on priorities before the grant is submitted.

- Describe your program’s approach to implementing a research-based coordinated coaching strategy, including the approach to the delivery of intensive coaching for identified staff.

At San Juan Unified there are Teachers on Special Assignments (TOSAs) who provide teachers with direct one-on-one coaching in the classroom. There are two TOSA positions assigned to the Early Head Start Center; Teachers and Home visitors. There are four TOSA positions assigned to the Head Start Preschool Teachers. Each TOSA is assigned a specific roster of teachers, this promotes relationship building and rapport. TOSAs have been provided with coaching specific training such as Elana Aguilar’s Bright Morning coaching trainings and the Division on Teaching and Learning at San Juan Unified has presented on Focused Supervision and How to Facilitate professional learning and dialogue. Additionally, the TOSA team has received trainings from the Hannah Institute and San Juan Unified Equity department and has implemented various monitoring checklists and tools are utilized to identify specific areas for coaching.

3. Program Management and Quality Improvement (see 1302 Subpart J)

- Describe key features of your program’s systems for ongoing oversight, correction, and assessment of progress towards your program’s identified goals. Include approaches that promote effective teaching and health and safety practices.

The Head Start Grant cycle allows us to continue to review data, make program improvement plans and complete yearly evaluations. State Grants and Nutrition Grants also provide structure for continuous monitoring and program improvement. After the grant is approved by the School Board in April, the Program Area Plan is completed based on the goals and plans made in the approved Grant for the upcoming school year. The content specialists begin preparation of their specific areas of the plan and develop implementation strategies for the upcoming school year. During the summer, content specialists and TOSAs develop the theme and focus of the August pre-service program and create resources that can be utilized throughout the school year by classroom staff. The leadership team has a substantial influence in planning the professional development experiences for the teaching staff. Trainings at the beginning of the year have a strong focus on safety and supervision to ensure all teachers understand the most important aspect of their job in the classroom. A safety checklist evaluates the classroom teacher’s knowledge of all the safety procedures in the classroom must be sent in by September. This is followed up with individual coaching from TOSAs and is provided to teachers who need more support and additional training.

Content specialists begin the self-assessment process in November. Trainings and resources are given for the program goals and appropriate data is chosen and analyzed to evaluate program growth. Strengths and Areas of Growth are established with action items. Monitoring tools are utilized regularly providing the data needed for the self-assessment process. Action plans are developed from identified areas of growth to allow the program to continue in its direction or intentionally pivot to get back on track.

- **Describe key features of your program’s management process and system to ensure continuous program improvement that relates to effectively using data and ongoing supervision to support individual staff professional development.**

In addition to SETA Head Start, CSPP, and CACFP monitoring tools ensure program compliance in many areas. Data from Learning Genie is utilized for monitoring student progress. Observations are recorded by teachers on a regular basis and are viewed and monitored by TOSAs and administrators. The three rating periods; Fall, Winter, and Spring, allow teachers and support staff to see both classroom-wide and individual student progress. Lesson plans submitted to the Education content specialist help identify the strengths and weaknesses in teacher instruction and individualization. Trainings are planned accordingly and individual coaching is provided by content specialist or TOSA.

- **Describe how the management system ensures budget and staffing patterns that promote continuity of care, allow sufficient time for staff participation in training and professional development, and allow for provision of the full range of services.**

The Program Manager of the San Juan Unified ECE department works closely with the fiscal manager and fiscal accountant. Meetings are held weekly as well as individual check ins to monitor the updated budget activity. The fiscal manager, accountant, and fiscal tech keep the administrators and Program Manager up to date on any issues that come up in the weekly reports that are run. If there are any issues that team collaborates on best solutions for the program in order to maintain the best quality of program and supports sustainability. In addition, the fiscal manager and accountant are in strong communication with the fiscal department at SETA. SETA works closely in supporting the financial oversight of all of the delegates. SETA performs yearly audits and regular check ins on large capital projects. Write ups and reports are required to complete any large capital projects for SETA to monitor. Finally, any budget modifications need to be approved by the Policy Committee and School Board.

## PROGRAM NARRATIVE  

### Cognition  
- **COG 4, Number Sense of Math Operations** had 39% of children at Exploring Later or Building Earlier for Winter 2023, and an additional 6% at Exploring Earlier.  
- **COG 3 Number Sense of Quantity** had the highest scores of the COG measures, with 58% of all preschoolers in the top 3 levels.  
- General trends in ECERS assessments included lower scores due to lack of Substantial Portion of the Day (SPOD), which may contribute to lower scores on cognitive measures.  
- Data may have reflected the ongoing focus on language and literacy skills and indicated a need to focus more closely on mathematical knowledge and skills to better support school readiness outcomes.  
- Phase 2 of Pre-K Mathematics Tutorial (PKMT) intervention trained teachers to provide math intervention activities for low-performing students. The next school year will have non-intervention teachers trained on the same research-based strategies and possible Tier 3 interventions aimed at all children.  
- Support staff have been trained and certified on the CLASS 2nd Edition and will be certified on the CLASS Environment Checklist. Classroom staff will receive refresher training on the CLASS dimensions and training on the environment checklist to reinforce good practices and support positive change.  
- A refresher training on best practices will be offered that emphasizes more facilitated time with learning materials to encourage deeper cognitive and physical skill development. Coaching by support staff will help to reinforce learning-focused activities.  

### Physical Development

- General trends in ECERS assessments included lower scores due to lack of Substantial Portion of the Day (SPOD), which may contribute to lower scores on physical measures.

### English Language Learning
- ELD 3, Understanding and Response to English Literacy Activities had 41% of English Learners at the Exploring or Developing English level.
- This data may reflect the large influx of refugee and dual language families in the program and may indicate a need for more training for teachers and language support staff on ELL strategies.
- In addition to teaching staff, Professional Development will be targeted toward bilingual support staff who support children and families in their home language.

San Juan Unified School District  
Early Childhood Education – Early Head Start  
Budget Narrative Fiscal Year August 1, 2024 – July 31, 2025  
TOTAL AWARD: $2,871,132  

For the Early Head Start program year spanning August 1, 2024 – July 31, 2025, the following has resulted in a change to program funding:

Current enrollment trends continue to show long wait lists for the infant and toddler centers. Due to this fact, San Juan Unified will be expanding the number of student slots for the center-based program. Additionally, in order to provide the highest quality home-based program, the home-visitor case load has been decreased from 12 to 10. This will reduce slots by 14, however funds for supporting this program will remain the same. The program will be increasing the Center-based EHS slots by 16 slots. Due to the fact that the home-based program will retain funding, 21 Head Start slots will be converted to $201,600 to support the additional center-based programs.

The San Juan Unified Basic Early Head Start Grant will be used as follows:

**Personnel (Schedule A): $1,739,624**  
Personnel costs include salaries for staff directly related to Head Start classroom instruction and related activities for the following:  
- Teachers working in the Home-Based portion of the EHS Program  
- Partial salaries for Teachers and Non-Instructional Support Aides in the year-round Center-Based program  
- Teachers and Non-Instructional Support Aides in the hybrid 10-month Center-Based and Home Visit model that are also year-round.  

Personnel costs also include salaries for Content Specialists and Teachers on Special Assignment (TOSAs) to ensure that Early Head Start services are planned, implemented, and monitored. Content Specialists and TOSAs provide coaching support for classroom Teachers and Non-Instructional Support Aides. Each content specialist has expertise in one or more of the following content areas:  
- Disability Services/Inclusion  
- Education (Curriculum, instruction, assessments)  
- Eligibility, Recruitment, Selection, Enrollment and Attendance (ERSEA)  
- Parent Community and Family Engagement  
- Safe Environments

![Financial Management System](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Financial+Management+System)

Financial Management System  
San Juan uses Frontline Escape for its accounting and reporting system. All funds, federal, state, local, or parent generated are maintained within the County Treasury by the Sacramento County Office of Education and financial reconciliation procedures are completed monthly. San Juan’s Budget and Fiscal Services Department ensures effective oversight and accountability for federal funds by conducting ongoing internal reviews. San Juan’s accounting system allows for individual accounts and multiple levels of resource centers allowing expenditure reports by various funding sources to be collected, reviewed, and audited for reasonable and allowable costs. It is from these reports that monthly fiscal reports are submitted to the grantee, Sacramento Employment Training Agency, for reimbursement of expenses, and to San Juan’s Governing Board, Policy Committee Board, and Program Management for review and approval of expenditures, budget development and program planning.

Early Childhood Education – Head Start  
Budget Narrative Fiscal Year August 1, 2024 – July 31, 2025  
TOTAL AWARD: $7,514,513  

For the Head Start program year spanning August 1, 2024 – July 31, 2025, the following has resulted in a change to program funding:

Beginning in 2019, San Juan Unified School District assumed 376 Head Start enrollment slots from Sacramento City Unified School District that the program had difficulty filling during the 2019-2020 school year. The COVID-19 pandemic also had very adverse effects on enrollment. In an effort to meet 100% enrollment requirements and meet the challenges in enrollment (additional slots funding and TK expansion in the district) 156 slots were returned at the 2023-24 grant application. Even though great efforts were made in recruitment and overall enrollment grew by 10%, 100% enrollment was not met and five Head Start classrooms remained closed. Current Office of Head Start mandates for full enrollment, along with mandates for improved safety and supervision, caused another cycle of slots returned to "right size". For the 24-25 Grant application, 176 slots will be returned. However, funding for 91 slots will be retained. $201,600 for EHS and $614,400 for Duration classes adopted.

The San Juan Unified Basic Head Start Grant will be used as follows:

**Personnel (Schedule A): $4,631,686**  
Personnel costs include salaries for staff directly related to instruction and related activities for the following:  
- Classroom Teachers  
- Child Development Assistants  
- Non-Instructional Support Aides  

Personnel costs also include salaries for Content Specialists and Special Assignment (TOSAs) to ensure that Head Start is implemented, and monitored. Content Specialists and TOSAs provide ongoing support for classroom Teachers, Child Development Assistants, and Instructional Support Aides. Each content specialist has expertise in one or more of the following content areas:  
- Disability Services/Inclusion  
- Education (curriculum, instruction, assessments)  
- Eligibility, Recruitment, Selection, Enrollment and Attendance (ERSEA)

- Early Childhood Education Program Manager (1)
- Program Administrators (2)

- Fiscal Technician II (1)
- Fiscal Technician I (3)
- Program & Admin Secretaries (3)

A percentage of the Early Childhood Education (ECE) Program Manager and assigned Secretary salaries are funded through the Head Start Grant to ensure communication between the HS Program, other ECE and San Juan programs including the Governing Board, continues to occur regularly. The ECE Program Manager also provides a vital link to services related to Indirect Costs such as Legal Services, Payroll, Maintenance and Operations, Purchasing, Fiscal Services, and Budget Services.

![Financial Management System](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Financial+Management+System)

**Financial Management System**  
San Juan uses Frontline Escape for its accounting and reporting system. All funds, federal, state, local, or parent generated are maintained within the County Treasury by the Sacramento County Office of Education and financial reconciliation procedures are completed monthly. San Juan’s Budget and Fiscal Services Departments ensure effective oversight and accountability for federal funds by conducting ongoing internal reviews. San Juan’s accounting system allows for individual accounts and multiple levels of resource centers allowing expenditure reports by various funding sources to be collected, reviewed, and audited for reasonable and allowable costs. It is from these reports that monthly fiscal reports are submitted to the grantee, Sacramento Employment Training Agency, for reimbursement of expenses, and to San Juan’s Governing Board, Policy Committee Board, and Program Management for review and approval of expenditures, budget development and program planning.

# LDO - Locally Designed (Program) Option

## What is LDO?
This is a waiver option. Programs may request to operate a locally-designed program option, including a combination of program options, to better meet the unique needs of their communities or to demonstrate or test alternative approaches for providing program services. In order to operate a locally-designed program option, programs must seek a waiver as described in this section and must deliver the full range of services, consistent with §1302.20(b), and demonstrate how any change to their program design is consistent with achieving program goals in subpart J of this part.

A program’s request to operate a locally-designed variation may be approved by the responsible Health and Human Services (HHS) official through the end of a program’s current grant or, if the request is submitted through a grant application for an upcoming project period, for the project period of the new award. Such approval may be revoked based on progress toward program goals as described in §1302.102 and monitoring as described in §1304.2.

(c) Waiver requirements.
<!-- Page 131 -->
(1) The responsible HHS official may waive one or more of the requirements contained in §1302.21(b), (c)(1)(i), and (c)(2)(iii) and (iv); §1302.22(a) through (c); and §1302.23(b) and (c), but may not waive ratios or group size for children under 24 months. Center-based locally-designed options must meet the minimums described in section 640(k)(1) of the Act for center-based programs.

(2) If the responsible HHS official determines a waiver of group size for center-based services would better meet the needs of children and families in a community, the group size may not exceed the limits below:

(i) A group that serves children 24 to 36 months of age must have no more than ten children; and,

(ii) A group that serves predominantly three-year-old children must have no more than twenty children; and,

(iii) A group that serves predominantly four- and five-year-old children must have no more than twenty-four children.

(3) If the responsible HHS official approves a waiver to allow a program to operate below the minimums described in §1302.21(c)(2)(iii) or (iv), a program must meet the requirements described in §1302.21(c)(2)(i), or in the case of a double session variation, a program must meet the requirements described in §1302.21(c)(2)(ii).

(4) In order to receive a waiver under this section, a program must provide supporting evidence that demonstrates the locally-designed variation effectively supports appropriate development and progress in children’s early learning outcomes.

(5) In order to receive a waiver of service duration, a program must meet the requirement in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, provide supporting evidence that it better meets the needs of parents than the applicable service duration minimums described in §1302.21(c)(1) and (c)(2)(iii) and (iv), §1302.22(c), or §1302.23(c), and assess the effectiveness of the variation in supporting appropriate development and progress in children’s early learning outcomes.

(d) Transition from previously approved program options. If, before November 7, 2016, a program was approved to operate a program option that is no longer allowable under §§1302.21 through 1302.23, a program may continue to operate that model until July 31, 2018.

MCQI - Monitoring for compliance and quality improvement

| **(Ranked by Very Convincing)** |  |
|----------------------------------|--|
| **(TECHNOLOGY)**                 | 30% |
| Today's competitive global economy requires students are well trained to use modern technology. This bond measure will upgrade science and computer labs, libraries, and classroom technology, so students can learn the vital skills needed to go to college or compete for good jobs. |
| **(PROPERTY VALUES)**            | 30% |
| This measure is a good long-term investment. Improving neighborhood schools strengthens local property values, and makes our community a more desirable place to live, do business, and raise a family. |
| **(TAX RATES)**                  | 30% |
| This bond measure will not increase tax rates but it will continue to provide much-needed funding to repair our aging local schools and continue to prepare students for college and career. |
| **(STUDENT HEALTH/SAFETY)**     | 29% |
| This measure will protect our students' health and safety by upgrading aging utilities, and heating and cooling systems, and improving fire and emergency communications systems. By funding these upgrades we can ensure our students’ environment is safer both on a day-to-day basis and in case of an emergency. |
| **(PROGRESS)**                   | 22% |
| San Juan USD’s last bond tied to safer, cleaner schools, heightened security, and high quality learning environments throughout the District; but despite the District’s smart financial management, many needs remain and the longer these are delayed, the more expensive they will become. |

# Conclusions

- The proposed San Juan USD measure appears viable. However, AB 195 now requires more tax information in the ballot questions itself. At the same time, the mood of Californians has worsened. Unlike 2016, support for the measure is far closer to the threshold for passage.
- Fifty-nine percent of voters say they would vote “yes” on the measure.
- A smaller $750 million bond doesn’t lead to a meaningful increase in support.
- The top priorities are preparing students for 21st century jobs, retaining and attracting high quality teachers, repairing leaky roofs, improving education for all students, keeping schools safe and clean, and preparing students for college and career.
- Support for the measure reaches a high-water mark 63% after information but with opposition, declines to 55%--speaking to the need of building consensus.
  - The most compelling info: basic repairs, lead contamination, and fiscal accountability.
  - Matching funds and retaining high quality teachers are also widely appealing.

- **Engage the Community (March – June)**
  - This will primarily involve myself and the Superintendent attending key meetings with local leaders, embedding content in our Facilities Master Plan site visits and soliciting feedback from our community through direct mail about their local schools.

- **Conduct a tracking survey in Late May/June to confirm viability.**

- **If viable, the Board would need to take action prior to August 8, 2024 in order to qualify a measure for the November 5, 2024 Presidential Ballot. (Sacramento County would prefer us to file by end of July)**
  - Ballot materials including Resolution and Ordinance with Expenditure Plan

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
## BOARD OF EDUCATION

### AGENDA ITEM: I-2
### MEETING DATE: 03/19/2024

**SUBJECT:** Dress Code Policy Update  
**DEPARTMENT:** Division of Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board hear a report on the process for revising the dress code policy.

---

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:
Beginning in 2019, the Superintendent’s Student Advisory Council (SSAC), along with students across the district, expressed concerns about the current San Juan Unified dress code policy (Board Policy 5132). During the 2020-2021 school year student listening sessions were held to gather feedback at El Camino Fundamental High School, Bella Vista High School, and Will Rogers Middle School. SSAC brought this issue forward as an area of concern in 2020. A student committee was formed and worked in conjunction with SSAC to create a survey, in which 4,500 students participated. Concerns focused on: gender bias, and discriminatory language, as well as issues with enforcing the policy, which included shaming, missed instructional time, and inconsistent enforcement from staff. In the 2022-2023 school year, a district committee was formed to draft an updated dress code policy. This report will review the process used to create the committee, develop a revised dress code policy, and the steps that will be taken to gather a wide range of input from students, staff, and the community on the draft policy. The public review period will be open from April 1 to May 17, 2024.

### Attachment B  

**Policy 5132: Dress And Grooming**  
**Status: ADOPTED**  
**Original Adopted Date: 03/29/2005**  

The Board of Education believes that appropriate student dress and grooming contribute to a productive learning environment. The Board expects students to give proper attention to personal cleanliness and to wear clothes that are appropriate for a K-12 educational environment, and suitable for the specific school activities in which they participate. Students' clothing must not present a health or safety hazard or create a disruption which would interfere with the educational process.

Individual schools may establish additional guidelines for its own students, so long as those guidelines are consistent with board policy and administrative regulations. If a school chooses to adopt guidelines, the principal shall include students, parents, and faculty in the formulation of those guidelines. Guidelines must ensure that the dress code does not single out or discriminate against religious expression or any other protected right. Students and parents shall be informed of the existence of the dress code, any guidelines, and consequences for violations at the time of initial enrollment and at the outset of each school year.

This is a draft version of a proposed policy developed from feedback from students, staff and families of San Juan Unified. This version may change as a result of additional input received during the ongoing review process.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
## PROPOSED DRESS CODE POLICY

In order to support our 8 Point Commitment to Educational Justice this policy applies to all schools. Schools may not enact more restrictive or less restrictive dress and grooming codes or modify this policy in any way.

### Dress Code Core Values
- Students have the right to be treated equitably.
- Dress code enforcement shall not create disparities, reinforce or increase the marginalization of any group, nor shall it be more strictly enforced against students because of racial identity, ethnicity, ability, gender identity, gender expression, gender nonconformity, sexual orientation, cultural or religious identity, household income, body size/type, or body maturity.
- All students are encouraged to dress in a manner that is comfortable and allows for an active school day.
- The student dress code shall serve to support all students to develop a body-positive self-image.
- An individual student’s clothing and self-expression will not be regulated based on another student or staff member’s personal perspective or discomfort, and students should not face unnecessary barriers to school attendance.
- Students are allowed to dress and style their hair for school in a manner that expresses their individuality without fear of body shaming. Education Code section 212.1.

### Dress Code Purpose:
- Maintaining a safe learning environment, where individualized clothing choices are supported, except in classes where protective or supportive clothing is needed or required, such as science (eye or body protection) or PE (athletic attire/shoes).
- Ensure students are a part of all learning opportunities or school activities, with minimal interruptions for dress code enforcement.

![Draft Policy Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Draft+Policy+Document)

This is a draft version of a proposed policy developed from feedback from students, staff and families of San Juan Unified. This version may change as a result of additional input received during the ongoing review process.

**Key Principles**

The primary responsibility for a student's attire resides with the student and their parent(s) or guardian(s). In addition, the school is responsible for supporting the health and safety of all students.

1. **Students MUST wear the following:**
   A. A non-transparent **shirt** spanning the front, back, and sides under the arms, covering the rib cage, AND  
   B. A non-transparent **bottom** (for example, a skirt, jeans, pants, leggings, a dress or shorts, that covers the buttocks while sitting and standing), AND  
   C. **Shoes** (Elementary students must wear shoes that at minimum have a heel strap.)

2. **Students MAY wear**, as long as these items do not violate Section 1 above:  
   A. Hats, durags, wave caps, and religious headwear. Hats must allow the face to be visible to staff, and not interfere with the line of sight of any student or staff.  
   B. Hoodie sweatshirts and beanies may be worn anytime. Wearing the hood over the head is allowed, but the face must be visible to school staff. Ears must remain visible during class time.  
   C. Fitted pants, including non-transparent leggings/yoga pants  
   D. Ripped jeans, as long as underwear and buttocks are not exposed  
   E. Tank tops, including spaghetti straps, halter tops, and “tube” (strapless) tops, & midriff-baring shirts  
   F. Athletic attire  
   G. Sweatpants/Pajama bottoms  
   H. Visible waistbands or visible straps on undergarments worn under other clothing (as long as this is done in a way that does not violate Section 1 above)  
   I. Sun-protective clothing, including but not limited to hats, for outdoor use during the school day. (Education Code section 35183.5)  
   J. Clothing with commercial, franchise, or athletic logos or images, provided they do not violate section 3 below  

3. **Students CANNOT wear clothing, jewelry, or personal items that depict:**  
   A. Violent language or images  
   B. Images or language depicting/suggesting drugs, alcohol, tobacco, vaping, or drug paraphernalia  
   C. Profanity, pornography, or any items that promote illegal or violent conduct  
   D. Promotion of a hate group/organization targeting specific groups defined as an organization that—based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its leaders, or its activities—has beliefs or practices that attack or malign protected classes (i.e., race, religions,

ethnicities, nationalities/national origins, genders, and/or sexual identities), typically for their fixed characteristics.  
E. Hate speech is any form of expression through which speakers intend to vilify, humiliate, or incite hatred against a group or a class of persons on the basis of race, religion, skin color, sexual identity, gender identity, ethnicity, disability, or national origin. (source: Matal v. Tam, 582 U.S. ___ (2017))  
F. Swimsuits, except when worn for PE or sports  
G. Accessories that could be considered dangerous or could be used as a weapon  
H. Covers the student’s face (except clothing/headgear worn for a religious or medical purpose)  
I. Demonstrate gang association/affiliation (as applied by school administration and law enforcement)  

## Addressing Dress Code Non-Compliance

Typical consequences for not complying with this policy can include parent/guardian contact or conference and the directive to cover, change, or remove the non-complying attire. The principal or their designee can notify a student’s parent/guardian of the school’s response to violations of the student dress code policy. The only reason a student will be removed from class is if they are non-compliant with the cannot wear or must wear sections.

If a student is non-compliant with the dress code, the following can occur:  
1. The loss of class time will be kept to a minimum and students will receive a non-verbal dress code slip to go to the office to address the non-compliance.  
   a. The use of the non-verbal slip is to preserve student dignity and avoid public shaming.  
2. Students will be asked to choose one of the below options:  
   a. Put on their own alternative clothing if already available at school  
   b. Turn the garment inside out  
   c. Put on a sweatshirt or jacket zipped up  
   d. Wear temporary school clothing for either the remainder of the day or until alternate clothing can be dropped off.  
      i. Students cannot be forced to wear clothing that is not theirs.  
   e. Parents/guardians may be called to bring alternative clothing.  
      i. If parents/guardians are called, students will return to class using one of the temporary alternative options above until their replacement garments arrive.  

No grade of a student participating in a physical education class shall be adversely affected if the student does not wear standardized physical education apparel because of circumstances beyond the student's control. (Education Code section 49066)

# OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTION

## FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

The San Juan Unified School District financial status is comprised of three major components: (1) Fund Balance (Ending and Beginning Balance); (2) Revenues; and (3) Expenditures. Estimates in the Second Interim Report are based on actual activity through January 31, 2024. The district certifies this report as **Positive**. The Second Interim Report will be presented in March 2024.

## DISTRICT MISSION

We empower all in our inclusive learning community to contribute and thrive in a radically evolving world.

## SHARED VALUES

We value:

- **Inclusivity**  
  We commit to cultivating an inclusive community of belonging with genuine respect for diverse cultures, identities and abilities.

- **Real World Knowledge**  
  We commit to creating environments and providing experiences that build and apply relevant skills and knowledge for the real world.

- **Voice**  
  We commit to hearing all voices, acknowledging, validating, and responding as we continuously grow together as a community.

- **Social and Emotional Intelligence**  
  We commit to creating a culture that embraces, teaches, models and applies social and emotional intelligence in all interactions with all stakeholders.

- **Perseverance**  
  We commit to creating a learning atmosphere that models and instills perseverance through adversity and encourages risk taking.
<!-- Page 174 -->
# CORE COMMITMENTS
- Prioritize resources to close opportunity gaps, improve teaching and learning, recruit and retain high quality employees and help all students reach their potential.
- Provide sound fiscal stewardship of community resources.
- Build trust by sharing useful, transparent fiscal information.
- Adopt a budget that consistently balances on-going revenues and expenditures to avoid a structural deficit.
- Preserve an ending fund balance that ensures integrity and stability of the district.

# CORE MESSAGES
- The state faces historically significant revenue shortfalls and budget deficits that could result in reduced education spending. The Governor’s January budget proposal addresses an estimated $58 billion state deficit, but spares K-12 education from spending reductions and funds an estimated 0.76% COLA for 2024-25.
- State revenues for the month of January 2024 were several billion dollars below the Governor’s January budget estimate, so it is very possible that the 24-25 education budget situation could deteriorate by the time the state’s budget is adopted in June.
- LEAs face near and long-term challenges, including risks to the state revenue forecast, cost pressures (e.g., pension rate increases, inflation), expiring one-time COVID-19 relief funds, special education-related cost pressures, and labor shortages.
- The district will continue to exercise caution and flexibility in long-term fiscal planning. The budget will support ongoing expenditures with ongoing revenues and meet the requirements of a positive certification. The district will preserve an ending fund balance that ensures integrity and stability.

# 2023-2025 MULTI-YEAR PROJECTIONS

The district primarily uses estimates from the Department of Finance (DOF) to project LCFF revenue growth in 2024-25 and 2025-26. The district Operations Department provides enrollment estimates, which are used to calculate Average Daily Attendance (ADA), the basis of state funding. Operating costs for future years are projected using historical patterns, statistical probabilities, and projected cost of living adjustments (COLA’s). Significant expenditure assumptions include salaries, seniority and retirement of employees, healthcare and other benefit costs, public pension plans (STRS and PERS), utilities, property, and liability insurance, etc.

## PLANNING FACTORS

### Part I - General Administrative Share of Plant Services Costs

California's indirect cost plan allows that the general administrative costs in the indirect cost pool may include that portion of plant services costs (maintenance and operations costs and facilities rents and leases) attributable to the general administrative offices. The calculation of the plant services costs attributed to general administration and included in the pool is standardized and automated using the percentage of salaries and benefits relating to general administration as proxy for the percentage of square footage occupied by general administration.

**A. Salaries and Benefits - Other General Administration and Centralized Data Processing**  
1. Salaries and benefits paid through payroll (Funds 01, 09, and 62, objects 1000-3999 except 3701-3702)  
   (Functions 7200-7700, goals 0000 and 9000)  
   **22,715,747.00**  
   
2. Contracted general administrative positions not paid through payroll  
   a. Enter the costs, if any, of general administrative positions performing services ON SITE but paid through a contract, rather than through payroll, in functions 7200-7700, goals 0000 and 9000, Object 5800.  
   b. If an amount is entered on Line A2a, provide the title, duties, and approximate FTE of each general administrative position paid through a contract. Retain supporting documentation in case of audit.

**B. Salaries and Benefits - All Other Activities**  
1. Salaries and benefits paid through payroll (Funds 01, 09, and 62, objects 1000-3999 except 3701-3702)  
   (Functions 1000-6999, 7100-7480, & 8100-8400; Functions 7200-7700, all goals except 0000 & 9000)  
   **528,947,329.00**  

**C. Percentage of Plant Services Costs Attributable to General Administration**  
(Line A1 plus Line A2a, divided by Line B1; zero if negative) (See Part III, Lines A5 and A6)  
**4.29%**

### Part II - Adjustments for Employment Separation Costs

When an employee separates from service, the local educational agency (LEA) may incur costs associated with the separation in addition to the employee's salary and benefits for the final payroll period. These additional costs can be categorized as "normal" or "abnormal" or mass separation costs.

Normal separation costs include items such as pay for accumulated unused leave or routine severance pay authorized by governing board policy. Normal separation costs are not allowable as direct costs to federal programs, but are allowable as indirect costs. State programs may have similar restrictions. Where federal or state program guidelines required that the LEA charge an employee's normal separation costs to an unrestricted resource rather than to the restricted program in which the employee worked, the LEA may identify and enter these costs on Line A for inclusion in the indirect cost pool.

Abnormal or mass separation costs are those costs resulting from actions taken by an LEA to influence employees to terminate their employment earlier than they normally would have. Abnormal or mass separation costs include retirement incentives such as a Golden Handshake or severance packages negotiated to effect termination. Abnormal or mass separation costs may not be charged to federal programs as other direct costs or indirect costs. Where an LEA paid abnormal or mass separation costs on behalf of positions in general administrative functions included in the indirect cost pool, the LEA must identify and enter these costs on Line B for exclusion from the pool.

**A. Normal Separation Costs (optional)**  
Enter any normal separation costs paid on behalf of employees of restricted state or federal programs that were charged to an unrestricted resource (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 1000-6999 or 8100-8400 rather than to the restricted program. These costs will be moved in Part III from the indirect cost pool to base costs. Retain supporting documentation.

**B. Abnormal or Mass Separation Costs (required)**  
Enter any abnormal or mass separation costs paid on behalf of general administrative positions charged to unrestricted resources (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 7200-7700. These costs will be moved in Part III from the indirect cost pool to base costs. If none, enter zero.

**A. Indirect Costs**  
1. Other General Administration, less portion charged to restricted resources or specific goals  
   (Functions 7200-7600, objects 1000-5999, minus Line B9)  
   **15,963,673.00**  

2. Centralized Data Processing, less portion charged to restricted resources or specific goals  
   (Function 7700, objects 1000-5999, minus Line B10)  
   **12,266,641.00**

## BOARD OF EDUCATION

### AGENDA ITEM: I-4
### MEETING DATE: 03/19/2024

**SUBJECT:** 2024-2027 Transportation Plan  
**DEPARTMENT:** Transportation  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the 2024-27 District Transportation Plan, as per Education Code (EC) Section 39800.1.

---

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:
In 2022-23, California enacted budget increased home-to-school transportation funding for school districts by reimbursing up to 60% of the prior year's transportation expenses.

Home-to-school Transportation Reimbursement was implemented by Assembly Bill (AB) 181 (Chapter 52, Statutes of 2022) and amended by AB 185 (Chapter 571, Statutes of 2022). It provides reimbursement funding for school districts and county offices of education based on the prior year's eligible transportation expenditures and the prior year's Local Control Funding Formula transportation-related add-on funding.

To receive the reimbursement, per Education Code (EC) Section 39800.1, as a condition of receiving appointments for Transportation Services (under EC Section 41850.1), a local educational agency shall develop a plan describing the transportation services provided. The plan shall be presented and adopted by the governing board of the local educational agency by April 1, preceding its effective fiscal year date.

---

### TRANSPORTATION PLAN COMPONENTS:
- Describe how transportation will be accessible to students with disabilities and homeless youth
- Include priority for planned services for students in grades TK-6 and low-income students
- Describe how unduplicated students may access free transportation
- Develop in consultation with staff, regional transportation authorities, local air pollution control districts, air quality management districts, parents and students

---

### SAN JUAN UNIFIED TRANSPORTATION PLAN:
The district’s transportation plan includes providing free transportation for students who reside within the district boundaries, attend a San Juan Unified school and transportation is designated in an individualized education program (IEP) or 504 accommodation plan, as well as students who are identified as McKinney-Vento homeless or foster youth. The district’s home-to-school transportation plan does not include priority services for grades TK-6 and low-income students due to the elimination of K-12 general education transportation in June 2011. General education home-to-school transportation is not required to receive reimbursement for allowable expenditures. Should funding be expanded, staff will assess the opportunity to add priority services in consultation with staff, students, families and the community. The approved transportation plan will be posted on the district’s transportation website.

## 2024-27 Transportation Plan

### BP 3541.2 – Transportation for Students with Disabilities

No person with exceptional needs shall be denied educational benefits or services because of the inaccessibility of school facilities.

The district has a responsibility to provide a program of special transportation services without cost to parents/guardians to ensure that handicapped students have accessibility to appropriate special education programs and services. The superintendent or designee shall ensure that transportation be available when it is required to assist the student to benefit from special education.

Special transportation shall be assigned in a manner that assists special education students to develop independent mobility skills to the maximum extent possible.

### Modes of Transportation

Transportation may be provided, using district-owned and operated vehicles, through contractual agreements with external providers, and by payment to parents/guardians when privately-owned automobiles or public transportation is used. In selecting the appropriate mode of transportation, the unique needs of the handicapped student, and the availability of equipment and schedules shall be considered. Direct reimbursement to parents/guardians will only be provided when all other alternatives are not feasible.

### Authority

Transportation will be provided only when the need for it is documented and recorded in the student's IEP. It is the responsibility of the IEP Team to determine that transportation is required to assist the student benefit from special education services.

DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSPORTATION PLAN  
The transportation plan is the first step in the apportionment process. The district’s home-to-school transportation plan does not include priority services for grades TK-6 and low-income students due to the elimination of K-12 general education transportation in June 2011. General education home-to-school transportation is not required to receive reimbursement for allowable expenditures.

As more funding opportunities are made available by the state, San Juan Unified School District will continue to consult with educational partners comprised of classified staff, teachers, parents, students, and administrators to prioritize transportation services that could expand to include transitional kindergarten, kindergarten, and any of grades 1 to 6, inclusive, as well as pupils who qualify as low income.
