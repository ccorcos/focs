As revised it reads:  
Status: ADOPTED  

Policy 5132: Dress And Grooming  

Original Adopted Date: 03/29/2005  
Last Reviewed Date: 03/29/2005 06/03/2024  
Last Revised Date: 06/03/2024  

The Board of Education believes that appropriate student dress and grooming contribute to a productive learning environment. The Board expects students to give proper attention to personal cleanliness and to wear clothes that are appropriate for a K-12 educational environment, and suitable for the specific school activities in which they participate. Students' clothing must not present a health or safety hazard or create a substantial disruption which would interfere with the educational process program.  

Individual schools may establish additional guidelines for its own students, so long as those guidelines are consistent with board policy and administrative regulations. If a school chooses to adopt guidelines, the principal shall include students, parents, and faculty in the formulation of those guidelines. District and school rules pertaining to student attire shall be included on the district website, in student handbooks, may be posted in school offices and classrooms, and may be periodically reviewed with all students as necessary.  

Students shall not be prohibited from dressing in a manner consistent with their gender identity or gender expression or with their religious or cultural observance. (Ed Code Section 220, BP 5145.41)  

Guidelines must ensure that the dress code does not single out or discriminate against students on the basis of cultural expression, hair texture, hairstyles, religious expression, body type or maturity, gender identity, gender expression, or any other protected right. (Ed Code Section 212.1)  

Students and parents shall be informed of the existence of the dress code, related guidelines, and consequences for violations at the time of initial enrollment and at the outset of each school year.  

The principal or designee is authorized to enforce this policy and shall inform any student who does not reasonably conform to the dress code. School administrators, teachers, and other staff shall be notified of appropriate and equitable enforcement of the dress code. The dress code shall not be enforced in a manner that discriminates against a particular viewpoint or results in a disproportionate application of the dress code based on students’ gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, household income, or body type or size. (Ed Code Section 220)

**Policy 5132.4: School Uniforms**  
**Status: ADOPTED**  
**Original Adopted Date: 05/23/1995 | Last Reviewed Date: 05/23/1995**

A safe school environment enables students, parents/guardians and staff to focus on education instead of personal safety. Student dress has an impact on school safety and student behavior, and is believed to convey or contribute to the general attitude of students toward school. Individual schools are authorized to adopt a school uniform as part of their dress code, by incorporating such dress code into their school safety plan. The Superintendent is directed to adopt an administrative regulation incorporating the legal requirements for schools wishing to adopt a uniform requirement as part of their dress codes.

(cf. 5116.3 – Open Enrollment)

Re: San Juan Unified School District Other Post-Employment Benefits  
GASB 75 Actuarial Report for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2024  

Dear Mr. Ryan:  

We are pleased to enclose our actuarial report providing financial information about the other post-employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities of the San Juan Unified School District. The report’s text describes our analysis and assumptions in detail.  

The primary purpose of this report is to provide information required by GASB 75 (“Accounting and Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pension”) to be reported in the District’s financial statements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. The information included in this report reflects that the District is financing its OPEB liability on a pay-as-you-go basis. Please let us know if we can be of assistance in preparing illustrations of how prefunding impacts the OPEB liability required to be reported under GASB 75.  

The exhibits presented are based on a roll forward of the results of the June 30, 2022, valuation, and on the employee and plan data provided to us for that valuation. The only assumption change reflected in this report is an update to the discount rate, in keeping with the change in the applicable municipal bond index on which it is based. Please note that the total of benefit payments for fiscal year 2023/24 is an estimate. If requested, we would be happy to update this report after June 30, 2024, when the final tally of benefit payments is available.  

As with any analysis, the soundness of the report is dependent on the inputs. Please review the information shown in the report to be comfortable that it matches your records.  

We appreciate the opportunity to work on this analysis and acknowledge the efforts of District employees who provided valuable time and information to enable us to prepare this report. Please let us know if we can be of further assistance.  

Sincerely,  

Catherine L. MacLeod, FSA, FCA, EA, MAAA

# A. Executive Summary

This report presents actuarial information regarding the other post-employment benefit (OPEB) program of the San Juan Unified School District (the District). The purpose of this valuation is to assess the OPEB liabilities and provide disclosure information as required by Statement No. 75 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB 75) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024.

Important background information regarding the valuation process can be found in the Appendices. We recommend users of the report read this information to familiarize themselves with the process and context of actuarial valuations, including the requirements of GASB 75. The pages following this executive summary present various exhibits and other relevant information appropriate for disclosures under GASB 75.

An updated valuation should be prepared as of June 30, 2024. Results of that valuation will first be applied to prepare that GASB 75 report for the District’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2025.

## OPEB Obligations of the District

The District provides continuation of medical and dental coverage to its retiring employees. This coverage may create one or more of the following types of OPEB liabilities:

- **Explicit subsidy liabilities:** An “explicit subsidy” exists when the employer contributes directly toward the cost of retiree healthcare. In this program, the District pays all or a portion of medical and dental premiums for qualifying retirees prior to age 65. Details are provided in Supporting Information Section 2.

- **Implicit subsidy liabilities:** An “implicit subsidy” exists when the premiums charged for retiree coverage are lower than the expected retiree claims for that coverage. In the District’s program, the premium rates for retirees are determined separately prior to and after eligibility for Medicare based on retiree experience alone, without consideration of active employee claims experience. We expect that the retiree premiums are set a level sufficient to cover retiree claims.

As is the nature of group premium rate structures, retirees are expected to experience higher claims than the premiums they pay at some ages, where at other ages, the reverse may be true. We prepared analysis described in Addendum 2: MacLeod Watts Age Rating Methodology. The result of this analysis indicates that the use of the retiree medical and dental premium rates without age-based adjustment serves as a reasonable basis for projecting the OPEB liability.

The District does not subsidize retiree health costs after age 65. Any subsidy between retirees ages 65 and older is paid by the retirees and not by the District.

## OPEB Funding Policy

The District’s OPEB funding policy affects the calculation of liabilities by impacting the discount used to develop the plan liability and expense. “Prefunding” is the term used when an agency consistently contributes an amount based on an actuarially determined contribution (ADC) each year. GASB 75 allows prefunded plans to use a discount rate that reflects the expected earnings on trust assets. Pay-as-you-go, or “PAYGO”, is the term used when an agency only contributes the required retiree benefits when due. When an agency finances retiree benefits on a pay-as-you-go basis, GASB 75 requires the use of a discount rate equal to a 20-year high grade municipal bond rate.

**Executive Summary**  
(Continued)  
The District is currently financing its OPEB liability on a pay-as-you-go basis. With the District’s approval, the discount rate used in this valuation is based on the Fidelity 20 Year AA General Obligation Municipal Bond Index. As of the beginning and end of the Measurement Period, use of this index results in discount rates of 3.69% as of June 30, 2022, and 3.86% as of June 30, 2023.

**Actuarial Assumptions**  
The actuarial “demographic” assumptions (i.e., rates of retirement, death, disability or other termination of employment) used in this report were chosen, for the most part, to be the same as the actuarial demographic assumptions used for the most recent valuation of the retirement plan(s) covering District employees. Other assumptions, such as age-related healthcare claims, healthcare trend, retiree participation rates and spouse coverage, were selected based on demonstrated plan experience and/or our best estimate of expected future experience. All these assumptions, and more, impact expected future benefits.

Please note that this valuation has been prepared on a closed group basis. This means that only employees and retirees present as of the valuation date are considered. We do not consider replacement employees for those we project to leave the current population of plan participants until the valuation date following their employment.

We emphasize that this actuarial valuation provides a projection of future results based on many assumptions. Actual results are likely to vary to some extent and we will continue to monitor these assumptions in future valuations. See Section 3 for a description of assumptions used in this valuation.

**Important Dates Used in the Valuation**  
GASB 75 allows reporting liabilities as of any fiscal year end based on: (1) a valuation date no more than 30 months plus 1 day prior to the close of the fiscal year end; and (2) a measurement date up to one year prior to the close of the fiscal year. The following dates were used for this report:  
- Fiscal Year End: June 30, 2024  
- Measurement Date: June 30, 2023  
- Measurement Period: June 30, 2022, to June 30, 2023  
- Valuation Date: June 30, 2022  

**Updates Since the Prior Report**  
This report is based on a roll forward of the June 30, 2022, valuation. No benefit changes and no material changes in plan members or premium rates were reported to MacLeod Watts from those in place at the time the June 30, 2022, valuation was prepared. No plan experience was recognized, and no assumptions were changed, other than an update to the discount rate as described above.

**Executive Summary**  
(Concluded)

**Impact on Statement of Net Position and OPEB Expense for Fiscal Year Ending 2024**

The plan’s impact on Net Position will be the sum of difference between assets and liabilities as of the measurement date plus the unrecognized net outflows and inflows of resources. Different recognition periods apply to deferred resources depending on their origin. The plan’s impact on Net Position on the measurement date can be summarized as follows:

**Important Notices**

This report is intended to be used only to present the actuarial information relating to other postemployment benefits for the District’s financial statements. The results of this report may not be appropriate for other purposes, where other assumptions, methodology and/or actuarial standards of practice may be required or more suitable. We note that various issues in this report may involve legal analysis of applicable law or regulations. The District should consult counsel on these matters; MacLeod Watts does not practice law and does not intend anything in this report to constitute legal advice. In addition, we recommend the District consult with their internal accounting staff or external auditor or accounting firm about the accounting treatment of OPEB liabilities.

### B. Results Measured as of June 30, 2023

The District’s OPEB liability measured as of June 30, 2023, was determined based on a “roll-forward” of the June 30, 2022, valuation. A roll-forward valuation moves the plan liability forward based on expected changes. For this type of valuation, we do not collect new plan data, and we generally do not change any actuarial assumptions. One exception is that changes in the liability discount rate reflecting changes in the municipal bond index or updated trust earnings expectations are reflected as of the new measurement date.

GASB allows roll-forward valuations to be performed in the year following the full biennial valuation if no material changes to the plan or the plan’s members have occurred. Examples of material changes would include significantly different terminations or retirements during the year than were assumed, or a change in the retirement plan provisions. No such events or plan amendments were reported by the District in the current measurement period.

The chart below reconciles the liability reported last year to that obtained by the roll-forward valuation as of the end of the current fiscal year.

# Accounting Information
(Continued)

## Recognition Period for Deferred Resources

Liability changes due to plan experience which differs from what was assumed in the prior measurement period and/or from assumption changes during the period are recognized over the plan’s Expected Average Remaining Service Life (“EARSL”). The EARSL of 11.07 years for the District and 7.53 years for Choices are the periods used to recognize such changes in the OPEB Liability arising during the current measurement period.

When applicable, changes in the Fiduciary Net Position due to investment performance different from the assumed earnings rate are always recognized over 5 years.

Liability changes attributable to benefit changes occurring during the period, if any, are recognized immediately.

## Deferred Resources as of Fiscal Year End and Expected Future Recognition

The exhibit below shows deferred resources as of the fiscal year end June 30, 2024.

**Sensitivity of Liabilities to Changes in the Discount Rate and Healthcare Cost Trend Rate**

The discount rate used for accounting purposes for the fiscal year end 2024 is 3.86%. Healthcare Cost Trend Rate was assumed to start at 6.8% (increase effective January 1, 2024) and grade down to 3.9% for years 2075 and later. The impact of a 1% increase or decrease in these assumptions is shown in the chart below.

| Sensitivity to:                     | Change in Discount Rate |                     |                     |                     |

## District Contributions to the Plan

District contributions to the Plan occur as benefits are paid to or on behalf of retirees. Benefit payments may occur in the form of direct payments for premiums (“explicit subsidies”) and/or indirect payments to retirees in the form of higher premiums for active employees (“implicit subsidies”). Note that the implicit subsidy contribution does not represent cash payments to retirees, but rather the reclassification of a portion of active healthcare expense to be recognized as a retiree healthcare cost. For details, see Appendix 1: Important Background Information.

All District OPEB contributions during the measurement period were in the form of retiree benefit payments, as shown below.

### For the Measurement Period,  
**Jul 1, 2022 thru Jun 30, 2023**

|                     | District   | Choices   | Total       |

| Implicit Subsidy Payment   | -          | -         | -           |
| **Total Contributions During the Measurement Period** | **6,576,678** | **12,558** | **6,589,236** |

The District’s OPEB benefits payments made after the measurement date but prior to the current fiscal year end in the chart below.

### For the Fiscal Year,  
**Jul 1, 2023 thru Jun 30, 2024**

|                     | District   | Choices   | Total       |

## Projected Benefit Payments (15-year projection)

The following is an estimate of other post-employment benefits to be paid on behalf of current retirees and current employees expected to retire from the District. Expected annual benefits have been projected on the basis of the actuarial assumptions outlined in Section 3.

These projections do not include any benefits expected to be paid on behalf of current active employees prior to retirement, nor do they include any benefits for potential future employees (i.e., those who might be hired in future years).

The amounts shown in the Explicit Subsidy table reflect the expected payment by the District toward retiree medical premiums in each of the years shown. The amounts are shown separately, and in total, for those retired on the valuation date (“current retirees”) and those expected to retire after the valuation date (“future retirees”). The benefit amounts shown for FYE 2024 are currently estimates and will be replaced with the actual amounts, once known.

The amounts shown in the Implicit Subsidy table reflect the estimated excess of retiree medical and prescription drug claims over the premiums expected to be charged during the year for retirees’ coverage. These amounts are also shown separately and in total for those currently retired on the valuation date and for those expected to retire in the future.

# GASB 75 Actuarial Report for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 2024

## D. Funding Information

Our understanding is that the District is currently financing its OPEB liability on a pay-as-you-go basis. Prefunding (setting aside funds to accumulate in an irrevocable OPEB trust) has certain advantages, one of which is the ability to (potentially) use a higher discount rate in the determination of liabilities for GASB 75 reporting purposes.

Should the District wish to explore potential future prefunding for this plan we can prepare illustrations of various funding levels and, if appropriate, perform a formal funding valuation at that time. Results under a funding scenario may be materially different from the results presented in this report.

E. Certification

The purpose of this report is to provide actuarial information in compliance with Statement 75 of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB 75) for other postemployment benefits provided by the San Juan Unified School District (the District). We summarized the benefits in this report and our calculations were based on our understanding of the benefits as described herein.

In preparing this report we relied without audit on information provided by the District. This information includes, but is not limited to, plan provisions, census data, and financial information. We performed a limited review of this data and found the information to be reasonably consistent. The accuracy of this report is dependent on this information and if any of the information we relied on is incomplete or inaccurate, then the results reported herein will be different from any report relying on more accurate information.

We consider the actuarial assumptions and methods used in this report to be individually reasonable under the requirements imposed by GASB 75 and taking into consideration reasonable expectations of plan experience. The results provide an estimate of the plan’s financial condition at one point in time. Future actuarial results may be significantly different due to a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, demographic and economic assumptions differing from future plan experience, changes in plan provisions, changes in applicable law, or changes in the value of plan benefits relative to other alternatives available to plan members.

Alternative assumptions may also be reasonable; however, demonstrating the range of potential plan results based on alternative assumptions was beyond the scope of our assignment except to the limited extent required by GASB 75. Plan results for accounting purposes may be materially different than results obtained for other purposes such as plan termination, liability settlement, or underlying economic value of the promises made by the plan.

This report is prepared solely for the use and benefit of the District and may not be provided to third parties without prior written consent of MacLeod Watts. Exceptions: The District may provide copies of this report to their professional accounting and legal advisors who are subject to a duty of confidentiality, and the District may provide this work to any party if required by law or court order. No part of this report should be used as the basis for any representations or warranties in any contract or agreement without the written consent of MacLeod Watts.

The undersigned actuaries are unaware of any relationship that might impair the objectivity of this work. Nothing within this report is intended to be a substitute for qualified legal or accounting counsel. The signing actuaries are members of the American Academy of Actuaries and meet the qualification standards for rendering this opinion.

¹ There were 85 active employees over age 65 as of the valuation date. These employees were excluded from the valuation and employee counts above as they have already aged out of any retiree health benefits. There were also 22 active employees labeled “Active-EligTemp” who were not valued in liabilities or in employee counts. It is our understanding that this group, while potentially eligible for OPEB in the future, is not currently OPEB-eligible. We will be monitoring this group and should anyone become eligible for OPEB benefits in the future, they will be included in the valuation at that time.

### Section 2 - Summary of Retiree Benefit Provisions

**OPEB provided:** The District provides retiree medical and dental coverage to age 65.

**Access to coverage:** In order to be eligible for any OPEB, retirees must first satisfy the requirements for retirement under their respective retirement plans. These age and service requirements are:
- **CalPERS** retirement requires attainment of age 50 (age 52, for PEPRA members) with 5 years of State or public agency service or approved disability retirement.
- **For CalSTRS,** attainment of age 55 with 5 years of State or public agency service or approved disability retirement with 5 years of State or public agency service. If membership began prior to January 1, 2013, an employee may retire at age 50 with 30 years of State or public agency service.

In addition to meeting the eligibility requirements of their retirement system, the following additional restrictions apply to the following groups to be eligible for retiree benefits:

| Group          | Service Retirement                | Disability Retirement            |
|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Classified      | 55 & 10 Years of District Service | 10 Years of District Service     |
| Teamsters       | 55 & 10 Years of District Service | 10 Years of District Service     |
| Supervisors     | 10 Years of District Service      | 10 Years of District Service     |
| Certificated    | 5 Years of District Service       | 5 Years of District Service      |
| Confidential    | 5 Years of District Service       | 5 Years of District Service      |
| Unrepresented    | 5 Years of District Service       | 5 Years of District Service      |
| Management*     | 5 Years of District Service       | 5 Years of District Service      |

*Management employees hired prior to October 1, 2000 had no minimum district service requirement.

**Benefits provided:** For eligible, retired full-time employees, the District pays 100% of the medical and dental insurance premium for employee-only coverage until the retiree reaches age 65. For part-time employees, the District pays a percentage of the medical and dental insurance premium for employee-only coverage until the retiree reaches age 65 equal to the employee’s percentage of full-time employment. The only coverage available after age 65 is with Kaiser Senior Advantage or United Health Senior Advantage Plan and Supplemental GAP Plan. In each case, after 65, the retiree must pay the full premium.

### Monthly 2023 Pre-Medicare Retiree Premiums

| Plan   | Kaiser | WHA HMO | Delta Dental |
|--------|--------|---------|--------------|
| Retiree only | $1,218.19 | $1,227.79 | $59.17 |

A District retiree who qualifies for continued medical and dental coverage at the time of retirement but declines enrollment due to other coverage is permitted to re-join the plan prior to age 65. In this event, the District will pick up the premium cost as if he or she elected coverage when first retired.

At the retiree’s expense, medical coverage may be continued for a spouse if he or she was covered prior to the employee’s retirement. Dental insurance, however, may not be continued beyond the COBRA period for dependents of retirees. 

*Retirees living outside the coverage area of either the Kaiser or Western Health Advantage plans receive reimbursement retiree only coverage up to the lowest cost plan (Kaiser HMO as of June 30, 2022).*

**Section 3 - Actuarial Methods and Assumptions**

The ultimate real cost of an employee benefit plan is the value of all benefits and other expenses of the plan over its lifetime. These payments depend only on the terms of the plan and the administrative arrangements adopted. The actuarial assumptions are used to estimate the cost of these benefits; the funding method spreads the expected costs on a level basis over the life of the plan.

**Important Dates**
- **Fiscal Year End:** June 30, 2024
- **GASB 75 Measurement Date:** June 30, 2023 (last day of the prior fiscal year)
- **Valuation Date:** June 30, 2022

**Valuation Methods**
- **Funding Method:** Entry Age Normal Cost, level percent of pay
- **Asset Valuation Method:** N/A; the plan is not being funded through a trust
- **Participants Valued:** Only current active employees and retired participants and covered dependents are valued. No future entrants are considered in this valuation.

**Development of Age-related Medical Premiums**

Actual premium rates for retirees and their spouses were adjusted to an age-related basis by applying medical claim cost factors developed from the data presented in the report, “Health Care Costs – From Birth to Death”, sponsored by the Society of Actuaries. A description of the use of claims cost curves can be found in MacLeod Watts’s Age Rating Methodology provided in Appendix 3 of this report.

Our analysis indicates that application of the monthly premium costs, shown in the chart in Section 2, provide a reasonable basis for determining the long term retiree claim costs for retirees prior to age 65.

Retirees over age 65 receive no paid employer benefits under this program and the premium rates are developed separately from active employees. Any subsidy between retirees age 65 and older are paid by the retirees themselves.

Accordingly, age-based premiums were not applied in this valuation.

## Section 3 - Actuarial Methods and Assumptions

### Economic Assumptions

**Municipal Bond Index**  
Fidelity 20 Year AA General Obligation Municipal Bond Index

**Discount Rates**  
3.86% as of June 30, 2023, and 3.69% as of June 30, 2022

**General Inflation Rate**  
2.5% per year

**Salary Increase**  
3.0% per year. Since benefits do not depend on salary, this is used to allocate the cost of benefits between service years.

**Healthcare Trend**  
Medical plan premiums and estimated claims costs by age are assumed to increase once each year. The increases over the prior year’s levels are assumed to be effective on the dates shown below:

| Effective January 1 | Premium Increase | Effective January 1 | Premium Increase |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| 2023 Actual          | 2.0%             | 2040-2043            | 4.8%             |

| 2029                  | 5.3%             | 2070                 | 4.2%             |
| 2030                  | 5.2%             | 2071-2072            | 4.1%             |
| 2031                  | 5.1%             | 2073-2074            | 4.0%             |
| 2032-2037            | 5.0%             | 2075                 | 3.9%             |
| 2038-2039            | 4.9%             | 2076 & Later         | 3.9%             |

The healthcare trend shown above was developed using the Getzen Model 2023 published by the Society of Actuaries using the following settings: CPI 2.5%; Real GDP Growth 1.4%; Excess Medical Growth 1.0%; Expected Health Share of GDP in 2032 20%; Resistance Point 21%; Year after which medical growth is limited to growth in GDP 2075.

Dental plan premiums are assumed to increase by 3.0% per year.

### Medicare Eligibility  
Absent contrary data, all individuals are assumed to be eligible for Medicare Parts A and B at age 65.

**Section 3 - Actuarial Methods and Assumptions**

**Participant Election Assumptions**

**Participation rate**  
**Participating actives:** 100% are assumed to continue their current medical plan election in retirement and elect Delta Dental coverage in retirement.  
**Non-participating actives:** 30% are assumed to elect coverage at a later date, and elect Kaiser medical coverage and Delta Dental coverage in retirement.  
**Retired participants:** Existing medical and dental plan elections are assumed to be maintained until the earlier of age 65 or the retiree’s death.

**Demographic Assumptions**

Demographic actuarial assumptions used in this valuation are based on the 2021 experience study of the California Public Employees Retirement System using data from 1997 to 2019, and on the January 2020 CalSTRS experience study report. The only difference in these assumptions relates to:

(1) the basis used to project future mortality improvement  
(2) that no pre-retirement decrements were applied for the Choices group due to the group size

Rates for selected age and service are shown below and on the following pages.

**Mortality Improvement**  
MacLeod Watts Scale 2022 applied generationally from 2017 (CalPERS) and from 2019 (CalSTRS); (see Appendices)

**Service Retirement Rates**  
| Schools                     |  
|-----------------------------|  
| CalPERS Classic: 2.0% @ 55 |  
| CalSTRS Classic: 2.0% @ 60 |  
| CalPERS & CalSTRS PEPRA: 2.0% @ 62 |

**Section 3 - Actuarial Methods and Assumptions**

**Software and Models Used in the Valuation**

**ProVal** - MacLeod Watts utilizes ProVal, a licensed actuarial valuation software product from Winklevoss Technologies (WinTech) to project future retiree benefit payments and develop the OPEB liabilities presented in this report. ProVal is widely used by the actuarial community. We review results at the plan level and for individual sample lives and find them to be reasonable and consistent with the results we expect. We are not aware of any material inconsistencies or limitations in the software that would affect this actuarial valuation.

**Age-based premiums model** – developed internally and reviewed by an external consultant at the time it was developed. See discussion on Development of Age-Related Medical Premiums and the Appendices.

**Getzen model** – published by the Society of Actuaries; used to derive medical trend assumptions described earlier in this section.

**Changes in assumptions or methods as of the Measurement Date**

**Discount Rates**  
Changed from a rate of 3.69% on June 30, 2022, to a rate of 3.86% on June 30, 2023.

# Appendix 2: Important Background Information

## General Types of Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB)

Post-employment benefits other than pensions (OPEB) comprise a part of compensation that employers offer for services received. The most common OPEB are medical, prescription drug, dental, vision, and/or life insurance coverage. Other OPEB may include outside group legal, long-term care, or disability benefits outside of a pension plan. OPEB does not generally include COBRA, vacation, sick leave (unless converted to defined benefit OPEB), or other direct retiree payments.

A direct employer payment toward the cost of OPEB benefits is referred to as an “explicit subsidy.” In addition, if claims experience of employees and retirees are pooled when determining premiums, retiree premiums are based on a pool of members which, on average, are younger and healthier. For certain types of coverage such as medical insurance, this results in an “implicit subsidy” of retiree premiums by active employee premiums since the retiree premiums are lower than they would have been if retirees were insured separately. GASB 75 and Actuarial Standards of Practice generally require that an implicit subsidy of retiree premium rates be valued as an OPEB liability.

| Expected retiree claims | Premium charged for retiree coverage | Covered by higher active premiums |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Retiree portion of premium | Agency portion of premium | Explicit subsidy |
|                         |                                     | Implicit subsidy |

*This chart shows the sources of funds needed to cover expected medical claims for pre-Medicare retirees. The portion of the premium paid by the Agency does not impact the amount of the implicit subsidy.*

Under GASB 45, for actuarial valuations dated prior to March 31, 2015, an exception allowed plan employers with a very small membership in a large “community-rated” healthcare program to avoid reporting of implicit subsidy liability. Following a change in Actuarial Standards of Practice and in accordance with GASB 75 requirements, this exception is no longer available.

## Valuation Process

The valuation was based on employee census data and benefits provided by the District. A summary of the employee data is provided in Table 1 and a summary of the benefits provided under the Plan is provided in Section 2. While individual employee records were reviewed to verify that they are reasonable in various respects, the data has not been audited and we have otherwise relied on the District as to its accuracy. The valuation was based on the actuarial methods and assumptions described in Section 3.

In developing the projected benefit values and liabilities, we first determine an expected premium or benefit stream over the employee’s future retirement. Benefits may include both direct employer payments (explicit subsidies) and/or an implicit subsidy, arising when retiree premiums are expected to be subsidized by active employee premiums. The projected benefit streams reflect assumed trends.

**Important Background Information (Continued)**

in the cost of those benefits and assumptions as to the expected date(s) when benefits will end. We then apply assumptions regarding:

- The probability that each individual employee will or will not continue in service to receive benefits.
- The probability of when such retirement will occur for each retiree, based on current age, service and employee type; and
- The likelihood that future retirees will or will not elect retiree coverage (and benefits) for themselves and/or their dependents.

We then calculate a present value of these benefits by discounting the value of each future expected benefit payment, multiplied by the assumed expectation that it will be paid, back to the valuation date using the discount rate. These benefit projections and liabilities have a very long time horizon. The final payments for currently active employees may not be made for many decades.

The resulting present value for each employee is allocated as a level percent of payroll each year over the employee’s career using the entry age normal cost method and the amounts for each individual year are then summed to get the results for the entire plan. This creates a cost expected to increase each year as payroll increases. Amounts attributed to prior fiscal years form the “Total OPEB Liability”. The OPEB cost allocated for active employees in the current year is referred to as “Service Cost”.

Where contributions have been made to an irrevocable OPEB trust, the accumulated value of trust assets (“Fiduciary Net Position”) is applied to offset the “Total OPEB Liability”, resulting in the “Net OPEB Liability”. If a plan is not being funded, then the Net OPEB Liability is equal to the Total OPEB Liability.

It is important to remember that an actuarial valuation is, by its nature, a projection of one possible future outcome based on many assumptions. To the extent that actual experience is not what we assumed, future results will differ. Some possible sources of future differences may include:

- A significant change in the number of covered or eligible plan members;
- A significant increase or decrease in the future premium rates;
- A change in the subsidy provided by the Agency toward retiree premiums;
- Longer life expectancies of retirees;
- Significant changes in estimated retiree healthcare claims by age, relative to healthcare claims for active employees and their dependents;
- Higher or lower returns on plan assets or contribution levels other than were assumed; and/or
- Changes in the discount rate used to value the OPEB liability.

## Requirements of GASB 75

The Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) issued GASB Statement No. 75, **Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions**. This Statement establishes standards for the measurement, recognition, and disclosure of OPEB expense and related liabilities (assets), note disclosures, and required supplementary information (RSI) in the financial reports of state and local governmental employers.

### Important Dates

GASB 75 requires that the information used for financial reporting falls within prescribed timeframes. Actuarial valuations of the total OPEB liability are generally required at least every two years. If a valuation is not performed as of the Measurement Date, then liabilities are required to be based on roll forward procedures from a prior valuation performed no more than 30 months and 1 day prior to the most recent year-end. In addition, the net OPEB liability is required to be measured as of a date no earlier than the end of the prior fiscal year (the “Measurement Date”).

### Recognition of Plan Changes and Gains and Losses

Under GASB 75, gains and losses related to changes in Total OPEB Liability and Fiduciary Net Position are recognized in OPEB expense systematically over time.

- **Timing of recognition**: Changes in the Total OPEB Liability relating to changes in plan benefits are recognized immediately (fully expensed) in the year in which the change occurs. Gains and losses are amortized, with the applicable period based on the type of gain or loss. The first amortized amounts are recognized in OPEB expense for the year the gain or loss occurs. The remaining amounts are categorized as deferred outflows and deferred inflows of resources related to OPEB and are to be recognized in future OPEB expense.

- **Deferred recognition periods**: These periods differ depending on the source of the gain or loss.
  - **Difference between projected and actual trust earnings**: 5-year straight-line recognition
  - **All other amounts**: Straight-line recognition over the expected average remaining service lifetime (EARSL) of all members that are provided with benefits, determined as of the beginning of the Measurement Period. In determining the EARSL, all active, retired and inactive (vested) members are counted, with the latter two groups having 0 remaining service years.

## Implicit Subsidy Plan Contributions

An implicit subsidy occurs when estimated retiree claims exceed the premiums charged for retiree coverage. When this occurs, we expect part of the premiums paid for active employees to cover a portion of retiree claims. This transfer represents the current year’s “implicit subsidy”. Because GASB 75 treats payments to an irrevocable trust or directly to the insurer as employer contributions, each year’s implicit subsidy is treated as a contribution toward the payment of retiree benefits.

The following hypothetical example illustrates this treatment:

| Hypothetical Illustration of Implicit Subsidy Recognition | For Active Employees | For Retired Employees |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
|                                                          |                      |                       |
| **Prior to Implicit Subsidy Adjustment**                 |                      |                       |
| Premiums Paid by Agency During Fiscal Year               | $411,000             | $48,000               |
| Accounting Treatment                                      |                      |                       |
| Compensation Cost for Active Employees                    |                      |                       |
|                                                          |                      |                       |
| **After Implicit Subsidy Adjustment**                    |                      |                       |
| Premiums Paid by Agency During Fiscal Year               | $411,000             |                       |
| Implicit Subsidy Adjustment                               | ($23,000)           | $23,000               |
| Accounting Cost of Premiums Paid                          | $388,000             | $71,000               |
| Accounting Treatment Impact                               | Reduces Compensation Cost for Active Employees | Increases Contributions to Plan & Benefits Paid from Plan |

The example above shows that total payments toward active and retired employee healthcare premiums is the same, but for accounting purposes part of the total is shifted from actives to retirees. This shifted amount is recognized as an OPEB contribution and reduces the current year’s premium expense for active employees.

## Discount Rate

When the financing of OPEB liabilities is on a pay-as-you-go basis, GASB 75 requires that the discount rate used for valuing liabilities be based on the yield or index rate for 20-year, tax-exempt general obligation municipal bonds with an average rating of AA/Aa or higher (or equivalent quality on another rating scale). When a plan sponsor makes regular, sufficient contributions to a trust in order to prefund the OPEB liabilities, GASB 75 allows use of a rate up to the expected rate of return of the trust. Therefore, prefunding has an advantage of potentially being able to report overall lower liabilities due to future expected benefits being discounted at a higher rate.

### Actuarial Funding Method and Assumptions

The “ultimate real cost” of an employee benefit plan is the value of all benefits and other expenses of the plan over its lifetime. These expenditures are dependent only on the terms of the plan and the administrative arrangements adopted, and as such are not affected by the actuarial funding method.

The actuarial funding method attempts to spread recognition of these expected costs on a level basis over the life of the plan, and as such sets the “incidence of cost”. GASB 75 specifically requires that the actuarial present value of projected benefit payments be attributed to periods of employee service using the Entry Age Actuarial Cost Method, with each period’s service cost determined as a level percentage of pay.

The results of this report may not be appropriate for other purposes, where other assumptions, methodology and/or actuarial standards of practice may be required or more suitable.

**Appendix 3: MacLeod Watts Age Rating Methodology**

Both accounting standards (e.g., GASB 75) and actuarial standards (e.g., ASOP 6) require that expected retiree claims, not just premiums paid, be reflected in most situations where an actuary is calculating retiree healthcare liabilities. Unfortunately, the actuary is often required to perform these calculations without any underlying claims information. In most situations, the information is not available, but even when available, the information may not be credible due to the size of the group being considered.

Actuaries have developed methodologies to approximate healthcare claims from the premiums being paid by the plan sponsor. Any methodology requires adopting certain assumptions and using general studies of healthcare costs as substitutes when there is a lack of credible claims information for the specific plan being reviewed.

Premiums paid by sponsors are often uniform for all employee and retiree ages and genders, with a drop in premiums for those participants who are Medicare-eligible. While the total premiums are expected to pay for the total claims for the insured group, on average, the premiums charged would not be sufficient to pay for the claims of older insureds and would be expected to exceed the claims of younger insureds. An age-rating methodology takes the typically uniform premiums paid by plan sponsors and spreads the total premium dollars to each age and gender to better approximate what the insurer might be expecting in actual claims costs at each age and gender.

The process of translating premiums into expected claims by age and gender generally follows the steps below.

1. **Obtain or Develop Relative Medical Claims Costs by Age, Gender, or other categories that are deemed significant.** For example, a claims cost curve might show that, if a 50-year-old male has $1 in claims, then on average a 50-year-old female has claims of $1.25, a 30-year male has claims of $0.40, and an 8-year-old female has claims of $0.20. The claims cost curve provides such relative costs for each age, gender, or any other significant factor the curve might have been developed to reflect. Section 3 provides the source of information used to develop such a curve and shows sample relative claims costs developed for the plan under consideration.

2. **Obtain a census of participants, their chosen medical coverage, and the premium charged for their coverage.** An attempt is made to find the group of participants that the insurer considered in setting the premiums they charge for coverage. That group includes the participant and any covered spouses and children. When information about dependents is unavailable, assumptions must be made about spouse age and the number and age of children represented in the population. These assumptions are provided in Section 3.

3. **Spread the total premium paid by the group to each covered participant or dependent based on expected claims.** The medical claims cost curve is used to spread the total premium dollars paid by the group to each participant reflecting their age, gender, or other relevant category. After this step, the actuary has a schedule of expected claims costs for each age and gender for the current premium year. It is these claims costs that are projected into the future by medical cost inflation assumptions when valuing expected future retiree claims.

The methodology described above is dependent on the data and methodologies used in whatever study might be used to develop claims cost curves for any given plan sponsor. These methodologies and assumptions can be found in the referenced paper cited as a source in the valuation report.

# Appendix 4: MacLeod Watts Mortality Projection Methodology

Actuarial standards of practice (e.g., ASOP 35, Selection of Demographic and Other Noneconomic Assumptions for Measuring Pension Obligations, and ASOP 6, Measuring Retiree Group Benefits Obligations) indicate that the actuary should reflect the effect of mortality improvement (i.e., longer life expectancies in the future), both before and after the measurement date. The development of credible mortality improvement rates requires the analysis of large quantities of data over long periods of time. Because it would be extremely difficult for an individual actuary or firm to acquire and process such extensive amounts of data, actuaries typically rely on large studies published periodically by organizations such as the Society of Actuaries or Social Security Administration.

As noted in a recent actuarial study on mortality improvement, key principles in developing a credible mortality improvement model would include the following:

1. Short-term mortality improvement rates should be based on recent experience.
2. Long-term mortality improvement rates should be based on expert opinion.
3. Short-term mortality improvement rates should blend smoothly into the assumed long-term rates over an appropriate transition period.

The MacLeod Watts Scale 2022 was developed from a blending of data and methodologies found in two published sources: (1) the Society of Actuaries Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2021 Report, published in October 2021 and (2) the demographic assumptions used in the 2021 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds, published August 2021.

MacLeod Watts Scale 2022 is a two-dimensional mortality improvement scale reflecting both age and year of mortality improvement. The underlying base scale is Scale MP-2021 which has two segments – (1) historical improvement rates for the period 1951-2017 and (2) an estimate of future mortality improvement for years 2018-2020 using the Scale MP-2021 methodology but utilizing the assumptions obtained from Scale MP-2015. The MacLeod Watts scale then transitions from the 2020 improvement rate to the Social Security Administration (SSA) Intermediate Scale linearly over the 10-year period 2021-2030. After this transition period, the MacLeod Watts Scale uses the constant mortality improvement rate from the SSA Intermediate Scale from 2030-2044. The SSA’s Intermediate Scale has a final step down in 2045 which is reflected in the MacLeod Watts scale for years 2045 and thereafter. Over the ages 95 to 118, the SSA improvement rate is graded to zero.

Scale MP-2021 can be found at the SOA website and the projection scales used in the 2021 Social Security Administrations Trustees Report at the Social Security Administration website.

# Glossary

**Actuarial Funding Method** – A procedure which calculates the actuarial present value of plan benefits and expenses, and allocates these expenses to time periods, typically as a normal cost and an actuarial accrued liability

**Actuarial Present Value of Projected Benefits (APVPB)** – The amount presently required to fund all projected plan benefits in the future. This value is determined by discounting the future payments by an appropriate interest rate and the probability of nonpayment.

**CalPERS** – Many state governments maintain a public employee retirement system; CalPERS is the California program, covering all eligible state government employees as well as other employees of other governments within California who have elected to join the system.

**Defined Benefit (DB)** – A pension or OPEB plan which defines the monthly income or other benefit which the plan member receives at or after separation from employment.

**Defined Contribution (DC)** – A pension or OPEB plan which establishes an individual account for each member and specifies how contributions to each active member’s account are determined and the terms of distribution of the account after separation from employment.

**Discount Rate** – Interest rate used to discount future potential benefit payments to the valuation date. Under GASB 75, if a plan is prefunded, then the discount rate is equal to the expected trust return. If a plan is not prefunded (pay-as-you-go), then the rate of return is based on a yield or index rate for 20-year, tax-exempt general obligation municipal bonds with an average rating of AA/Aa or higher.

**Expected Average Remaining Service Lifetime (EARSL)** – Average of the expected remaining service lives of all employees that are provided with benefits through the OPEB plan (active employees and inactive employees), beginning in the current period.

**Entry Age Actuarial Cost Method** – An actuarial funding method where, for each individual, the actuarial present value of benefits is levelly spread over the individual’s projected earnings or service from entry age to the last age at which benefits can be paid.

**Excise Tax** – The Affordable Care Act created an excise tax on the value of employer sponsored coverage which exceeds certain thresholds (“Cadillac Plans”). The tax was repealed in December 2019.

**Explicit Subsidy** – The projected dollar value of future retiree healthcare costs expected to be paid directly by the Employer, e.g., the Employer’s payment of all or a portion of the monthly retiree premium billed by the insurer for the retiree’s coverage.

**Fiduciary Net Position** – The value of trust assets used to offset the Total OPEB Liability to determine the Net OPEB Liability.

**Health Care Trend** – The assumed rate(s) of increase in future dollar values of premiums or healthcare claims, attributable to increases in the cost of healthcare; contributing factors include medical inflation, frequency or extent of utilization of services and technological developments.

**Implicit Subsidy** – The projected difference between future retiree claims and the premiums to be charged for retiree coverage; this difference results when the claims experience of active and retired employees are pooled together, and a ‘blended’ group premium rate is charged for both actives and retirees; a portion of the active employee premiums subsidizes the retiree premiums.

**Net OPEB Liability (NOL)** – The liability to employees for benefits provided through a defined benefit OPEB. Only assets administered through a trust that meet certain criteria may be used to reduce the Total OPEB Liability.

**Net Position** – The Impact on Statement of Net Position is the Net OPEB Liability adjusted for deferred resource items.

**OPEB Expense** – The OPEB expense reported in the Agency’s financial statement. OPEB expense is the annual cost of the plan recognized in the financial statements.

**Plan Assets** – The value of cash and investments considered as 'belonging' to the plan and permitted to be used to offset the AAL for valuation purposes. To be considered a plan asset, GASB 75 requires (a) contributions to the OPEB plan be irrevocable, (b) OPEB assets be dedicated to providing OPEB benefit to plan members in accordance with the benefit terms of the plan, and (c) plan assets be legally protected from creditors, the OPEB plan administrator and the plan members.

**Public Agency Miscellaneous (PAM)** – Non-safety public employees.

**Select and Ultimate** – Actuarial assumptions which contemplate rates which differ by year initially (the select period) and then stabilize at a constant long-term rate (the ultimate rate).

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
## BOARD OF EDUCATION

### AGENDA ITEM: G.10
### MEETING DATE: 06/25/2024

**SUBJECT:** Aspire Alexander Twilight Secondary Academy and Aspire Alexander Twilight College Prep Academy 2022-2023 Annual Independent Financial Audit Report

**DEPARTMENT:** Fiscal Services

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board receive the 2022-2023 Consolidated Audit Report for Aspire Alexander Twilight Secondary Academy (ATSA) and Aspire Alexander Twilight College Prep Academy (ATCPA).

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Pursuant to Education Code 47604.32(d), the San Juan Unified School District (“District”), as the chartering authority, is required to monitor the fiscal condition of each charter school under its authority. The district is in receipt of fiscal information as provided by ATSA and ATCPA.

The district has and will rely upon the fiscal information as represented to the district by the charter school. Any and all monitoring requirements performed by the district will be based on the accuracy and completeness of the information as provided to the district.

Gilbert CPAs (the charter school’s independent auditor) has expressed its opinion on the consolidated financial statements of Aspire Public Schools and affiliates (collectively, “the Organization”) that “the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Organization as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.”

Education Code 47605(m) requires each charter school to annually provide a copy of its independent financial audit report to the chartering authority, the controller and county superintendent.

The following information is reported in the Aspire Public School’s 2022-2023 audit report for the period ending June 30, 2023: Aspire Twilight Secondary Academy’s ending cash and cash equivalent was $2,551,494, total revenues equaled $9,931,497, total expenditures equaled $9,089,355 and net assets were $3,474,285. Aspire Twilight College Prep Academy’s ending cash and cash equivalent was $1,582,396, total revenues equaled $10,430,563, total expenditures equaled $9,606,812 and net assets were $2,441,304.

Aspire Public Schools, the parent corporation for ATSA and ATCPA, has a combined ending-cash and cashequivalent balance for the period ending June 30, 2022, of $102,282,635 and reports combined net assets of $148,392,990. The organization makes payments related to a $20.5 million line of credit extended to April 26, 2024. The credit line is secured by certain select school revenues and had an out-standing balance of $10,000,000 on both June 30, 2023, and 2022. The Organization has remaining bonds and other long-term debt with outstanding balances due of $239,010,457 and $244,421,197 as of June 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which mature at various times through August 2061 and bear interest rates ranging from 2-5%.

There were findings for questioned costs under the ASES Grant for the lack of supporting monthly attendance reports to support program attendance records for ATSA and ATCPA in addition to many other charters of the Organization. This is a repeat finding for the prior year and requires a corrective action plan from management.

Aspire Public Schools  
Oakland, California  

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**

**Opinion**  
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Aspire Public Schools, a non-profit public benefit corporation, and affiliates (collectively, the Organization), which comprises the consolidated statements of financial position as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of activities, functional expenses, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Organization as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Basis for Opinion**  
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Organization and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**  
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Organization's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards; Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Organization's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Organization's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.

**Supplementary Information**

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The accompanying Supplementary Information, as listed in the Table of Contents, as required by the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel, and as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required

part of the consolidated financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the consolidated financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the consolidated financial statements or to the consolidated financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.  

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards  

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 15, 2023, on our consideration of the Organization’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the Organization’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Organization’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

1. **OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

Aspire Public Schools, a non-profit public benefit corporation (the "Organization"), was formed to manage, guide, direct, and promote charter schools that provide quality education to youth in primary and secondary grades. The Organization was founded in 1998. The Organization's support is derived primarily from public education monies, individual and foundation contributions, and government agency grants.

In addition to managing school operations, Aspire Public Schools controls three affiliated organizations that were created to facilitate ownership of certain school facilities and support development of charter schools. The facilities are owned and managed by two single-member limited liability companies, College for Certain, LLC (CFC LLC), and College for Certain II, LLC (CFC II LLC). The sole member of both LLCs is College for Certain, Inc. (CFC INC) which was created as a supporting organization of Aspire Public Schools to facilitate and support the development of charter schools. CFC INC is controlled by, and for the benefit of, Aspire Public Schools. CFC LLC and CFC II LLC are disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes.

Aspire Public Schools Foundation (the "Foundation") was formed in July 2019 as a supporting nonprofit public benefit corporation to Aspire Public Schools. The Foundation is controlled by, and for the benefit of, Aspire Public Schools. The Foundation’s support is derived primarily from private donations and foundation grants.

For financial reporting purposes, CFC LLC, CFC II LLC, CFC INC, and the Foundation, are consolidated with Aspire Public Schools.

**Principles of Consolidation** – The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Aspire Public Schools and its controlled affiliated organizations, collectively the “Organization”. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Listed below are the affiliated organizations included in these financial statements:

- **Aspire Public Schools** – Aspire Public Schools operates thirty-six schools in California under thirty-six charters which are chartered by twelve charter authorizers (sponsoring districts) in seven counties. Charters were granted for each school for up to five years, with an opportunity for renewal. Charters may be revoked by the sponsoring district for material violations of the charter, failure to meet or make progress toward student outcomes identified in the charter, failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management, or violation of any provision of the law. As of June 30, 2023, the charter schools operated by Aspire Public Schools were as follows:

* Charter issuance date or the most recent renewal date.

** 2021-2022 Education Trailer Bill AB 130 Sec 58 established a new Education Code Section 47607.7, in which all charter schools whose term expires on or between January 1, 2022, and June 2025 will have their term extended by two years. An additional one-year extension was given for schools by operation of law (Education Code Section 47607.4 amended by SB 114). The Organization is in the process of obtaining official revisions to its MOUs and charter petitions with the oversight agencies for this revision.

All sponsoring districts receive up to 1% of the annual charter revenue for supervisory oversight. Ravenswood City School District, the sponsoring district for Aspire East Palo Alto Charter receives up to 3% for supervisory oversight because the district provides facilities substantially rent-free.

Through June 30, 2023, the Organization had separately negotiated with all sponsoring districts for administrative fees and other services. Additionally, for some schools, transportation expenses and/or special education encroachment are paid by the Organization to the sponsoring districts.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022

Accounts receivable represent funding from state and local government agencies, of which the Organization has an unconditional right to receive. Accounts receivables are stated at the amount management expects to be collected from the outstanding balance.

**Contributions receivable** – Unconditional promises to give that are expected to be collected within one year are recorded at net realizable value. Unconditional promises to give that are expected to be collected in more than one year are recorded at fair value, which is measured as the present value of their future cash flows. The discounts on those amounts are computed using risk-adjusted interest rates applicable to the years in which the promises are received. In subsequent years, amortization of the discounts is included in contribution revenue. In the absence of donor stipulations to the contrary, promises with payments due in future periods are restricted to use after the due date. Management determines the allowance for uncollectable contributions receivable based on historical experience, an assessment of economic conditions, and a review of subsequent collections and are written off when deemed uncollectable. Management has determined that no allowance is deemed necessary as of June 30, 2023 and 2022.

**Investments** – Investments with readily determinable fair values are stated at fair value and held for long-term purposes. Other investments without readily determinable fair values are valued using the measurement alternative approach, which is cost, minus any impairment, plus or minus any changes resulting from observable price changes in an orderly transaction for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.

**Property and equipment** with a value greater than $5,000 are capitalized at cost or fair market value on the date of receipt, in the case of donated property, and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to thirty years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lease term (including options) or the useful life. Major additions are capitalized, and repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the life of the assets are expensed. When assets are sold or retired, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with the resulting gain or loss reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Activities.

**Leases** – The Organization determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Leases are included in right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. ROU assets and lease liabilities reflect the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, and ROU assets also include prepaid or accrued rent. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Organization does not report ROU assets and lease liabilities for its short-term leases (leases with a term of 12 months or less). Instead, the lease payments of those leases are reported as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate certain leases. The value of a lease is reflected in the valuation if it is reasonably certain management will exercise an option to extend or terminate a lease.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022

The Organization receives grant funds that are considered conditional contributions and are not recorded or recognized until the applicable condition has been met, generally expenditure on costs allowable under the grant agreement, or satisfaction of performance obligations. At June 30, 2023 and 2022, $4,743,057 and $5,087,510, respectively, of grant funds are included in deferred revenue to be recognized in future periods as conditions are met. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Organization had $1,000,000 and $1,200,000, respectively, of conditional contributions available to be recognized in revenue in future periods under such grants. In some cases, the Organization may not be able to access the full amount available under the agreement based on its activities and level of expenditures.

Donor-restricted contributions are reported as increases in net assets with donor restrictions. When a restriction expires, net assets with donor restrictions are reclassified to net assets without donor restrictions and reported in the consolidated statement of activities as net assets released from restrictions. Restricted contributions that were initially classified as conditional due to a qualifying expense barrier are recognized as net assets without donor restrictions since the restriction is met simultaneously when the condition is released, and the revenue is recognized.

Contributions of property and equipment are reported as net assets with donor restrictions if the donor restricted the use of the property or equipment to a particular program, as are contributions of cash restricted to the purchase of property and equipment. Donor restrictions on contributions of property and equipment or assets restricted for purchase of property and equipment are considered to expire when the assets are placed in service.

Other revenues consist of amounts from constituents for sales revenue from student stores, after school programs, lunch income, and ticket income for events. Funds received in advance of earning are deferred to the applicable period in which the related service are performed. See Note 12 for additional disclosures for revenue from contracts with customers.

Donated equipment, materials, services, and facilities – In-kind contributions of equipment, materials, and services are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of donation. Donated services are recorded when they create or enhance non-financial assets or require a specialized skill that the Organization would otherwise need to purchase. During the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, no in-kind contributions were received.

Income taxes – The Organization has been granted tax-exempt status as provided by Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and Section 23701(d) of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has determined the Organization is not a private foundation within the meaning of Section 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been reflected in these financial statements.

Functional allocation of expenses – The cost of providing educational programs and other activities has been summarized on a functional basis in the consolidated statement of activities. The consolidated statement of functional expenses presents the natural classification of expenses by function. Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated among the programs and supporting services benefited. The expenses that are allocated include rent and occupancy and depreciation, which are allocated on a square footage basis, as well as salaries and wages, employee benefits, professional services, and other, which are allocated on the basis of estimates of time and effort.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022

**Program development and expansion** – The Organization continually explores potential opportunities for expansion and growth; thus, costs are incurred to research the possibility of establishing new sites. The Organization capitalizes these preacquisition costs into ‘Construction in progress’ (Note 7) at the time incurred. If it is determined that a formal contractual commitment will not be entered into, the expenses are included in program development and expansion in the period that the determination is made.

**Fair value measurements** – Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or market information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might not be available. However, the objective of a fair value measurement in both cases is the same—to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (that is, an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability).

In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs is used to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows:

- **Level 1 Inputs**  
  Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.

- **Level 2 Inputs**  
  Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.

- **Level 3 Inputs**  
  Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

When a price for an identical asset or liability is not observable, a reporting entity measures fair value using another valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Because fair value is a market-based measurement, it is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. As a result, a reporting entity’s intention to hold an asset or to settle or otherwise fulfill a liability is not relevant when measuring fair value.

**Use of estimates** – Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates the estimates and assumptions based on new information. Management believes that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results could differ from those estimates.

**Subsequent events** have been reviewed through December 15, 2023, the date the consolidated financial statements were available to be issued. Management concluded that no material subsequent events have occurred since June 30, 2023 that require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

### 2. LIQUIDITY AND AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES

The Organization’s financial assets available within one year of the statements of financial position date for general expenditure are as follows at June 30:

| Financial Assets                     | 2023          | 2022          |

| Accounts receivable                   | 62,322,407    | 67,289,808    |
| Contributions receivable              | 710,279       | 665,279       |
| **Total financial assets, available within one year** | **165,315,321** | **122,249,842** |
| Less:                                |               |               |
| Amounts unavailable for general expenditures within one year, due to: |               |               |

| **Total financial assets available for general expenditures** | **$ 117,833,693** | **$ 105,958,316** |

The Organization’s goal is to maintain or exceed financial assets at a level sufficient to protect its schools against program cuts arising from unanticipated state revenue or enrollment shortfalls, unexpected cost increases, and economic uncertainties, such that it can meet 5-6 weeks of operating expenses (approximately $23.0 million) and its bond covenants. As part of its liquidity plan, school sites also have target reserves to cover repairs, maintenance, and minor capital improvements. The Organization has a $20,500,000 line of credit available to meet cash flow needs.

### 3. CONCENTRATIONS OF CASH

The Organization maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts that at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Organization has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Management believes the Organization is not exposed to any significant credit risk related to cash. The Organization held deposits with four financial institutions in excess of federal depository insurance limits of $146,255,873 and $134,896,101 as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Organization has not experienced any losses in such accounts and management believes the Organization is not exposed to any significant credit risk related to cash.

### 4. RESTRICTED CASH

Restricted cash consists of amounts that are required to be held for debt service reserves for principal and interest payments with respect to the bond outstanding; and contributions restricted to investment in property and equipment. The total restricted cash at June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $44,685,062 and $82,470,899, respectively. The current portion of $8,055,666 and $11,758,404 as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was restricted for current bond debt obligations. The noncurrent portion of $36,629,396 at June 30, 2023 consisted of $11,336,576 for debt service reserves and $25,292,820 for investment in property and equipment. The noncurrent portion of $70,712,495 at June 30, 2022 consisted of $10,995,079 for debt service reserves and $59,717,416 for investment in property and equipment.

Accounts receivable balances at June 30, 2023 and 2022 were $62,322,407 and $67,289,808, respectively, and were due entirely from grantor government agencies. Management deems all receivables to be collectible as of June 30, 2023 and 2022.

### 6. CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVABLE
The Organization recognizes unconditional contributions receivable at their estimated fair value using estimated prevailing interest rates, on a nonrecurring basis, at the time the pledge is made.

### Revolving Line of Credit
In February 2021 a line of credit was secured for a maximum borrowing amount of $20,500,000 and with a maturity date of January 31, 2022. In January 2022, the line was extended to a maturity date of April 29, 2022. In April 2022, the line was extended to a maturity date of April 28, 2023. In April 2023, the line was extended to a maturity date of April 26, 2024.

The line of credit carries an interest rate equal to the Prime Rate. The interest rate was 8.25% and 4.75% at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The line had an outstanding balance of $10,000,000 as of June 30, 2023 and 2022. The credit line is secured by school revenues of select schools which are not already secured by other debt.

### 9. CAPITALIZATION OF CONSTRUCTION DEBT INTEREST
While a facility is under construction, a portion of interest is capitalized into its cost. In summary, the capitalization of interest is applicable to the amount of interest that could have been avoided had the Organization not undertaken the building of a capital asset. The Organization evaluates capitalization of interest at the individual site level since the cash from one site would not be used to pay down the debt on another site.

The amount of capitalizable interest is determined by applying the debt interest rate to the average amount of accumulated expenditures for the building during the year. Interest costs of $7,964,294 and $6,406,153 were incurred related to debt during the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, interest totaling $2,826,212 and $1,870,274, respectively, was capitalized into the cost of the project.

### 10. LEASES
#### Operating leases
The Organization leases buildings for administrative offices in Oakland, Huntington Park, and Stockton and leases land and buildings for school sites in Berkeley, East Palo Alto, Empire, Los Angeles, Modesto, Oakland, Sacramento, and Stockton under various operating leases. The Organization also leases copiers at various school sites. The operating lease agreements range from

two to thirty-five years. For the year ended June 30, 2023, total operating lease costs were $4,484,358, including short-term lease costs totaling $1,259,162 and variable lease costs totaling $71,128. For the year ended June 30, 2022, total operating lease costs were $2,556,599, including variable lease costs totaling $39,064. The Organization has one variable lease where the monthly rate is based upon the number of students served in the respective school year. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities totaled $3,096,983 and $2,410,021 for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Organization has made an accounting policy election to use a risk-free rate in lieu of its incremental borrowing rate to discount future lease payments. The weighted-average discount rate applied to calculate lease liabilities as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, was .70% and .41%, respectively.

As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, the weighted-average remaining lease term for all operating leases was 13.62 and 14.58 years, respectively.

Future payments due under these leases as of June 30, 2023 are as follows:

### JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022

### California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS)
- **Plan name:** California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) State & Schools
- **Plan’s EIN:** 94-6207465
- **Market value of assets:** $79,386
- **Actuarial accrued liability:** $113,795
- **Funded status:** 65-80% funded

The actuarial value of assets and accrued liability are expressed in millions and are valued as of June 30, 2021 with a measurement date of June 30, 2022, the most recent information available.

### Plan Description
The Organization participates in the Schools Pool (the CalPERS Plan), a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee retirement system defined benefit pension plan administered by CalPERS. CalPERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating entities within the State of California. CalPERS issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information for this plan. This report is available online at www.calpers.ca.gov.

### Benefits Provided
The benefits for the CalPERS Plan are established by contract, in accordance with the provisions of the California Public Employees’ Retirement Law (PERL). The benefits are based on members’ years of service, age, final compensation, and benefit formula. Benefits are provided for disability, death, and survivors of eligible members or beneficiaries. The California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA) made significant changes to the benefit structure but primarily affect members first hired to perform CalPERS credited activities on or after January 1, 2013. As a result of PEPRA, the CalPERS Plan has two benefit structures: 1) CalPERS 2% at 55 – Members first hired on or before December 31, 2012, to perform CalPERS credited activities, and 2) CalPERS 2% at 62 – Members first hired on or after January 1, 2013, to perform CalPERS credited activities. To be eligible for service retirement, members hired prior to January 1, 2013, must be at least age 50 with a minimum of five years of CalPERS-credited service, while members hired after January 1, 2013, must be at least age 52 with a minimum of five years of service.

### Contributions
Section 20814(c) of the PERL requires that the employer contribution rates for all employers be determined on an annual basis by the actuary and shall be effective on the July 1 following notice of a change in the rate. Contribution rates for the CalPERS Plan are determined annually on an actuarial basis as of June 30 by CalPERS. The CalPERS Plan’s actuarially determined rate is the estimated amount necessary to finance the costs of benefits earned by employees during the year, with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued liability. Classic plan members, defined as a member who joined CalPERS prior to January 1, 2013, are required to contribute 7% of their salary (7% of monthly salary over $133.33 if the member participates in Social Security). New members who joined CalPERS for the first time on or after January 1, 2013, are required to contribute 7% of their salary. The required employer contribution rate for fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, and 2022 were 25.37% and 22.91% of annual payroll, respectively. The contribution requirements of the plan members are established by state statute. For the fiscal year 2024, the Organization is required to contribute 26.69% of annual payroll.

The benefits for the CalSTRS Plan are established by contract, in accordance with the provisions of the State Teachers’ Retirement Law. Benefits are based on members’ years of service, age, final compensation, and a benefit formula. Benefits are provided for disability, death, and survivors of eligible members or beneficiaries.

## 12. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

Revenue from contracts with customers consists of sales revenue from student stores, after school programs, lunch income, and ticket income for events. Revenue is earned at a point in time when goods or services are provided, or the events occur.

This revenue totaled $398,367 and $35,808 for years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Organization has determined that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by the limited geographical area from which their schools draw their student enrollment. Adverse changes in the local economy may have an adverse impact on the ability of families to pay for these goods, services, or events.

A contract asset is recorded when the Organization satisfies a performance obligation of a contract but is not yet entitled to payment. When the Organization becomes entitled to payment, the contract asset is classified as a receivable, whether invoiced or not.

The balances of receivables from contracts with customers are as follows as of June 30:

|                     | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |
|---------------------|------|------|------|
| Accounts receivable  | $-   | $-   | $-   |

Funds received in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenue, which represents a contract liability. Contract liabilities totaled $0 at June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.

### 14. RISKS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Organization has received state and federal funds for specific purposes that are subject to review and audit by the grantor agencies. Although such audits could generate disallowances under terms of the grants, it is believed that any reimbursement, if required, would not be material.

The Organization has various outstanding claims and litigation. However, based on consultation with legal counsel, management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Organization’s financial position or results of operations.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

To the Board of Directors  
Aspire Public Schools  
Oakland, California  

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the consolidated financial statements of Aspire Public Schools, a non-profit public benefit corporation, and affiliates (collectively, the "Organization") which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of activities, functional expenses, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated December 15, 2023.

## Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the consolidated financial statements, we considered the Organization's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Organization’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Organization’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified.

**Report on Compliance and Other Matters**  

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Organization’s consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the consolidated financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards and which are described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as items 2023-001 and 2023-002.  

**The Organization’s Response to Findings**  

Government Auditing Standards requires the auditor to perform limited procedures on the Organization’s response to the findings identified in our audit and described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. The Organization’s responses were not subjected to the other auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the responses.  

**Purpose of this Report**  

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Organization’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH 2022-23 GUIDE FOR ANNUAL AUDITS OF K-12 LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES AND STATE COMPLIANCE REPORTING**

To the Board of Directors  
Aspire Public Schools  
Oakland, California  

**Report on State Compliance**

**Qualified and Unmodified Opinions**

We have audited Aspire Public Schools’ (the Organization) compliance with the types of compliance requirements identified as subject to audit in the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel identified in the schedule below for the year ended June 30, 2023.

**Qualified Opinion on Transitional Kindergarten and After School and Education Safety Program**

In our opinion, except for the noncompliance described in the Basis for Qualified and Unmodified Opinions section of our report, the Organization complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each applicable state program for the year ended June 30, 2023.

**Unmodified Opinion on Each of the Other State Programs**

In our opinion, the Organization complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on the compliance applicable to the Organizations programs identified in the below schedule for the school year ended June 30, 2023.

**Basis for Qualified and Unmodified Opinions**

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Our responsibilities under those standards, and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.

We are required to be independent of the Organization and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on compliance for each applicable state program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the Organization’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.

**Matter Giving Rise to Qualified Opinion on Transitional Kindergarten**  
As described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs, the Organization did not comply with requirements regarding Transitional Kindergarten as described in finding number 2023-001 for maximum pupil enrollment.  

Compliance with such requirements is necessary, in our opinion, for the Organization to comply with the requirements applicable to that program.  

**Matter Giving Rise to Qualified Opinion on After School and Education Safety Program**  
As described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs, the Organization did not comply with requirements regarding After School and Education Safety Program as described in finding number 2023-002 for attendance reporting.  

Compliance with such requirements is necessary, in our opinion, for the Organization to comply with the requirements applicable to that program.  

**Responsibilities of Management for Compliance**  
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the Organization’s State programs.  

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance**  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the Organization’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and there is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, *Government Auditing Standards*, and the *2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting* will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the Organization’s compliance with the requirements of State Compliance as a whole.  

In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, *Government Auditing Standards*, and the *2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting*, we:  

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the Organization’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses over compliance that we identified during the audit.

In connection with the requirements referred to above, we selected and tested transactions and records to determine the Organization’s compliance with the applicable programs identified below:

**Report on Internal Control over Compliance**

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified.

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

**Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program**

**Opinion on Each Major Federal Program**

We have audited Aspire Public Schools’ (Organization) compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the Organization’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2023. The Organization’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.

In our opinion, the Organization complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major programs for the year ended June 30, 2023.

**Basis for Opinion on Each Major Federal Program**

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Our responsibilities under those standards and the Uniform Guidance are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.

We are required to be independent of the Organization and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the Organization’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.

**Responsibilities of Management for Compliance**

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the Organization’s federal programs.

## SECTION II - FINANCIAL STATEMENT FINDINGS  
There were no findings for the year ended June 30, 2023.  

## SECTION III - STATE COMPLIANCE FINDINGS  

### 2023-001. Transitional Kindergarten – CDDC #40000  

**Criteria:**  
According to Education Code (EC) Section 48000 (g)(1) a condition of receiving apportionment for pupils in a transitional kindergarten (TK) program pursuant to Education Code Section 46300 is the maintenance of an average transitional kindergarten class enrollment of no more than 24 pupils for each school site.  

**Condition:**  
During our testing of transitional kindergarten, we found the TK average class enrollment at Aspire Port City Academy exceeded 24 pupils per class.  

**Cause:**  
The Organization did not have sufficient procedures in place to ensure the compliance of TK average class enrollment requirements.  

**Effect/Questioned Cost:**  
Per (EC) Section 48000(C) the penalty for an excess of 24 pupils per class for TK is the loss of the kindergarten through grade 3 Local Control Funding Formula grade span adjustment for all TK ADA in the local educational agency.  

The second principal apportionments TK ADA for Aspire Port City Academy was 21.14 ADA resulting in a loss of apportionment of $20,146.42.  

**Recommendation:**  
The Organization should ensure procedures are in place to ensure TK average class enrollment does not exceed statutory maximums. We recommend that active enrollment is reviewed on a monthly basis.  

**Corrective Action Plan/Management’s Response:**  
Moving forward, we will cap the enrollment at 24 students for our lottery drawing.

### 2023-002. AFTER SCHOOL AND EDUCATION SAFETY PROGRAM (ASES)– CDDC # 40000

**Criteria:**  
California Education Code Section 8482-8484.6 8483 (a)(1) and (2) Elementary school and middle school or junior high school pupils must participate in the full day of the program, except as allowed by the early release policy. Reported number of pupils served should be supported by written records.

**Condition:**  
Supporting documents for daily attendance records selected as part of our sample did not support the number of students served as reported to the CDE in 6 of 145 sampled days at the following sites: Aspire Langston Hughes Academy and Aspire Alexander Twilight College Preparatory Academy. Additionally, the January 2023-June 2023 monthly attendance records did not support the attendance reported to the California Department of Education for the time period January 2023-June 2023 at the following sites: Aspire Antonio Maria Lugo Academy, Aspire Berkley Maynard Academy, Aspire Richmond California College Preparatory Academy, Aspire Port City Academy, Aspire Titan Academy, Aspire Golden State Preparatory Academy, Aspire Triumph Technology Academy, Aspire East Palo Alto Charter School, Aspire Langston Hughes Academy, Aspire Gateway Academy, Aspire Alexander Twilight College Preparatory Academy, Aspire Aspire River Oaks Charter School, Aspire Firestone Academy, Aspire Alexander Twilight Secondary Academy, Aspire Olin University Preparatory Academy, Aspire Rosa Parks Academy, Aspire APEX Academy, Aspire Inseek Academy, Aspire College Academy, Aspire Centennial College Preparatory Academy, Aspire Slauson Academy, Aspire Pacific Academy, and Aspire Richmond California College Preparatory Academy.

**Effect:**  
The number of students who were claimed for attendance in 6 of 145 sampled days were not accurately supported. Attendance claimed over a six month period was not supported by monthly attendance reports.

**Cause:**  
Manual errors in underlying data for reported program attendance resulted in errors in data submitted for program attendance.

**Questioned Cost:**  
Questioned costs could not be calculated since the funding for this program is based on a pre-approved 3 year grant cycle and is not based on a per-ADA rate.

**Recommendation:**  
This is a repeat of a finding in the previous year audit. We recommend that the Organization adequately train ASES program providers to ensure that reported attendance data is accurate and sufficiently supported. Furthermore, we recommend the Organization perform a secondary review to ensure there are no differences between the recorded attendance data and the supporting records.

**Corrective Action Plan/Management’s Response:**

The error was caused because the attendance entered into our student information system (SIS) was not syncing properly with our internal platform that generates the monthly reports, resulting in discrepancies. As a result, we will transition away from using the internal platform and utilize an alternative report embedded in our SIS, along with conducting regular checks and training.

Education Code 47605(m) requires each charter school to annually provide a copy of its independent financial audit report to the chartering authority, the controller and county superintendent.  

According to the CMP 2022-2023 audit report, ending cash on hand and in banks was $4,263,891, total revenues equaled $19,064,186 and total expenditures equaled $17,720,744 for the period ending June 30, 2023. The audit report reflects net assets of $7,110,210.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

**Board of Directors**  
California Montessori Project  
San Juan Campus  
Carmichael, California  

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**  

**Opinion**  
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of California Montessori Project – San Juan Campus (the School), a component of California Montessori Project (a California nonprofit public benefit corporation), which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the related statements of activities, cash flows, and functional expenses for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the School as of June 30, 2023, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Basis for Opinion**  
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the School and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Change in Accounting Principle**  
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 2023 the School adopted new accounting guidance for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for all operating and finance leases with lease terms greater than one year. Our opinion is not modified with response to this matter.

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**  
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

![Board of Directors](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Board+of+Directors+California+Montessori+Project+San+Juan+Campus)

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the School's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date the financial statements are available to be issued.

**Auditors' Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements**  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the School’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the School’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.

**Supplementary Information**  
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the School’s financial statements as a whole. The accompanying supplementary schedules as identified in the table of contents are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statement. Such information is the responsibility of management and, except for the portion marked “unaudited,” was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole. The Local Education Agency Organization Structure, which is marked “unaudited,” has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it.

**Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards**  
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued a report dated December 5, 2023 on our consideration of the School’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness on the School’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the School’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

### NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### JUNE 30, 2023  

## NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

### Nature of Activities  
California Montessori Project (the Schools), a California nonprofit public benefit corporation, aims to provide a quality, tuition-free Montessori education that challenges our students to reach their full potential. The California Montessori Project – San Juan Campus (the School) was approved in 2006 by the San Juan Unified School District (the District) to operate as a separate Charter. The School operates at three separate school sites (American River, Orangevale, and Carmichael) within the geographical boundaries of San Juan Unified School District. The American River School site is currently located in Fair Oaks, the Orangevale School site is currently located in Orangevale, and the Carmichael Campus School site is currently located in Carmichael. The School is an operating segment of California Montessori Project, Inc., a nonprofit corporation. The School is funded principally through the California Department of Education and the District. The School is governed by a Governing Board consisting of one Community Representative, two Business Representatives, one Montessori Representative, one Charter Representative, four Parent Representatives, one from each charter, and up to four District Representatives. In addition, the currently employed Superintendent(s) will sit on the Governing Board as non-voting member(s).  

The District has granted the charter through June 30, 2027, subject to amendment and renewal. The charter may be revoked by the District only for material violations of the charter, failure to meet student outcomes identified in the charter, failure to meet generally accepted standards of fiscal management, or violation of any provisions of the law.  

The School also has a memorandum of understanding with the sponsoring District whereby the Schools pay the District 1% of the Schools’ per pupil Local Control Funding Formula revenues to provide administrative oversight.  

### Basis of Accounting  
The financial statements have been prepared on the accrual method of accounting and accordingly reflect all significant receivables and liabilities.  

### Basis of Presentation  
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  

### Use of Estimates  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures.

### Use of Estimates  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.  

### Functional Allocation of Expenses  
Costs of providing the School's programs and other activities have been presented in the statement of functional expenses. During the year, such costs are accumulated into separate groupings as either direct or indirect. Indirect or shared costs are allocated among program and support services by a method that best measures the relative degree of benefit.  

### Cash and Cash Equivalents  
The School's cash and cash equivalents include only cash on hand, demand deposits, and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.  

### Net Asset Classes  
Net assets, revenues, gains, and losses are classified based on the existence or absence of donor or grantor-imposed restrictions. Accordingly, net assets and changes therein are classified and reported as follows:  

- **Net Assets Without Donor Restrictions** – Net assets available for use in general operations and not subject to donor (or certain grantor) restrictions.  

- **Net Assets With Donor Restrictions** – Net assets subject to donor- (or certain grantor-) imposed restrictions. Some donor-imposed restrictions are temporary in nature, such as those that will be met by the passage of time or other events specified by the donor. Other donor-imposed restrictions are perpetual in nature, where the donor stipulates that resources be maintained in perpetuity. Donor-imposed restrictions are released when a restriction expires, that is, when the stipulated time has elapsed, when the stipulated purpose for which the resource was restricted has been fulfilled, or both.  

The School's net asset with donor restrictions for the year ended and as of June 30, 2023 consist of $150,195 of net assets purpose restricted for Prop 39 Clean Energy expenditures.  

### Accounts Receivable  
Accounts receivable primarily represent amounts due from federal and state governments as of June 30, 2023. Management believes that all receivables are fully collectible; therefore, no provisions for uncollectible accounts were recorded.

## NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  

**Property, Plant, and Equipment**  
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost, if purchased or at estimated fair value, if donated. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.  

**Revenue Recognition**  
Amounts received from the California Department of Education are recognized as revenue by the School based on the average daily attendance (ADA) of students. Revenue that is restricted is recorded as an increase in net assets without donor restrictions, if the restriction expires in the reporting period in which the revenue is recognized. All other restricted revenues are reported as increases in net assets with donor restriction.  

**Contributions**  
All contributions are considered to be available for use unless specifically restricted by the donor. Amounts received that are restricted to specific use or future periods are reported as contributions with donor restrictions. Restricted contributions that are received and released in the same period are reported as promises to give without donor restrictions. Unconditional promises to give expected to be received in one year or less are recorded at net realizable value. Unconditional promises to give expected to be received in more than one year are recorded at fair value at the date of the promise. Conditional promises to give are not recognized until they become unconditional, that is, when the conditions on which they depend are substantially met.  

**Conditional Grants**  
Grants and contracts that are conditioned upon the performance of certain requirements or the incurrence of allowable qualifying expenses (barriers) are recognized as revenues in the period in which the conditions are met. Amounts received are recognized as revenue when the School has incurred expenditures in compliance with specific contract or grant provisions. Amounts received prior to incurring qualifying expenditures are reported as deferred revenues in the statement of financial position. As of June 30, 2023, the School has conditional grants of $2,414,520 of which $1,279,584 is recognized as deferred revenue in the statement of financial position.  

**Contributed Assets and Services**  
Contributions of donated noncash assets are recorded at fair value in the period received. Contributions of donated services that create or enhance nonfinancial assets or that require specialized skills, are provided by individuals possessing those skills, and would typically need to be purchased if not provided by donation, are recorded at fair values in the period received.

**NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

**Property Taxes**  
Secured property taxes attach as an enforceable lien on property as of January 1. Taxes are levied on September 1 and are payable in two installments on or before November 1 and February 1. Unsecured property taxes are not a lien against real property and are payable in one installment on or before August 31. The County bills and collects property taxes for all taxing agencies within the County and distributes these collections to the various agencies. The sponsor agencies of the School are required by law to provide in-lieu property tax payments on a monthly basis, from August through July. The amount paid per month is based upon an allocation per student, with a specific percentage to be paid each month.

**Compensated Absences**  
Accumulated unpaid employee vacation benefits are recognized as a liability of the School. The compensated absences liability is reported on the statement of financial position. Employees of the School are paid for days or hours worked based upon Board approved schedules which include vacation. Sick leave is accumulated without limit for each employee at the equivalent rate of one day for each full month of service. Sick leave with pay is provided when employees are absent for health reasons, but accrued sick leave is not paid to employees at the end of employment and therefore, is not reported as a liability on the financial statements.

**Income Taxes**  
California Montessori Project is a nonprofit entity exempt from the payment of income taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 23701d. Accordingly, no provision has been made for income taxes. Management has determined that all income tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon potential audit or examination; therefore, no disclosures of uncertain income tax positions are required. The School files informational returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the state of California.

**Leases**  
The School leases school facilities and equipment and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, and operating lease liabilities on the statement of financial position. Finance leases are included in financing ROU assets, and lease liabilities – financing on the statement of financial position.

### NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  

**Leases (Continued)**  
ROU assets represent the School’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the School’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of leases do not provide an implicit rate, the School uses a risk-free rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the School will exercise that option. The School has elected to recognize payments for short-term leases with a lease term of 12 months or less as expense as incurred and these leases are not included as lease liabilities or ROU assets on the statement of financial position.

The School has elected not to separate nonlease components from lease components and instead accounts for each separate lease component and the nonlease component as a single lease component.

The School’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

In evaluating contracts to determine if they qualify as a lease, the School considers factors such as if the School has obtained substantially all of the rights to the underlying asset through exclusivity, if the School can direct the use of the asset by making decisions about how and for what purpose the asset will be used and if the lessor has substantive substitution rights. This evaluation may require significant judgment.

The individual lease contracts do not provide information about the discount rate implicit in the lease. Therefore, the School has elected to use a risk-free rate determined using a period comparable with that of the lease term for computing the present value of lease liabilities.

**Adoption of New Accounting Standards**  
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842). The new standard increases transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities on the statement of financial position. Most prominent of the changes in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.

The School adopted the requirements of the guidance effective July 1, 2022 and has elected to apply the provisions of this standard to the beginning of the period of adoption with certain practical expedients available.

### NOTE 1 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  

**Adoption of New Accounting Standards (Continued)**  
The School has elected to adopt the package of practical expedients available in the year of adoption. The School has elected to adopt the available practical expedient to use hindsight in determining the lease term and in assessing impairment of the School’s ROU assets.  

The School elected the available practical expedients to account for existing capital leases and operating leases as finance leases and operating leases, respectively, under the new guidance, without reassessing (a) whether the contracts contain leases under the new standard, (b) whether classification of capital leases or operating leases would be different in accordance with the new guidance, or (c) whether the unamortized initial direct costs before transition adjustments would have met the definition of initial direct costs in the new guidance at lease commencement.  

In addition, the School elected the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term for existing leases.  

As a result of the adoption of the new lease accounting guidance, the School recognized on July 1, 2022 a ROU asset at the carrying amount of the operating lease asset of $8,858,411. The School also recognized on July 1, 2022 an operating lease liability of $8,858,411 which represents the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using the risk free rate as of July 1, 2022.  

The standard had a material impact on the statement of financial position but did not have an impact on the statement of activities, nor the statement of cash flows. The most significant impact was the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities for operating leases.  

**Evaluation of Subsequent Events**  
The School has evaluated subsequent events through December 5, 2023, the date these financial statements were available to be issued.  

### NOTE 2 LIQUIDITY AND AVAILABILITY  

Financial assets available for general expenditure are those without donor or other restrictions limiting their use within one year of the statement of financial position date. Financial assets available for general expenditures are comprised of the following as of June 30, 2023:  

| **Cash on Hand and in Banks** | $ 4,263,891 |  
| **Accounts Receivable** | 5,269,285 |  
| **Intercompany Receivable** | 239,476 |  
| **Less: Donor Restrictions** | (150,195) |  
| **Total** | $ 9,622,457 |

### NOTE 2 LIQUIDITY AND AVAILABILITY (CONTINUED)  
As part of its liquidity management plan, the School monitors liquidity required and cash flows to meet operating needs on a monthly basis. The School structures its financial assets to be available as general expenditures, liabilities, and other obligations come due.  

### NOTE 3 CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  
The School maintains bank accounts with numerous institutions. Accounts at each institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000. At times, cash in these accounts may exceed the insured amounts. The School has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash in banks.  

### NOTE 4 PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT  
Property, plant, and equipment in the accompanying financial statements is presented net of accumulated depreciation. The School capitalizes all expenditures for land, buildings and equipment in excess of $10,000. Depreciation expense was $88,018 for the year ended June 30, 2023.  

A summary of changes in property, plant, and equipment as of June 30, 2023 is as follows:  

|                          | June 30, 2022 | Additions | Retirements | June 30, 2023 |  
|--------------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|  
| Leasehold Improvements    | $ 875,348      | $ 11,285  | $ -         | $ 886,633      |  
| Equipment                 | 517,183        | -         | -           | 517,183        |  
| Less: Accumulated Depreciation | (693,362)  | (88,018)  | -           | (781,380)      |  
| Total                     | $ 699,169      | $ (76,733)| $ -         | $ 622,436      |  

### NOTE 5 EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT  
**Multiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plan**  
Qualified employees are covered under multiemployer defined benefit pension plans maintained by agencies of the state of California.  

The risks of participating in these multiemployer defined benefit pension plans are different from single employer plans because: (a) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (b) the required member, employer, and state contribution rates are set by the California Legislature, and (c) if the School chooses to stop participating in the multiemployer plan, they may be required to pay a withdrawal liability to the plan. The School has no plans to withdraw from this multiemployer plan.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

**Board of Directors**  
California Montessori Project  
San Juan Campus  
Carmichael, California  

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of California Montessori Project – San Juan Campus (the School), a nonprofit California public benefit corporation, which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the related statements of activities, cash flows, and functional expenses for the year then ended, the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated December 5, 2023.

## Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the School's internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the School's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the School's internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that have not been identified.

## Report on Compliance and Other Matters  
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the School's financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.  

## Purpose of this Report  
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

![Independent Auditors' Report on State Compliance and Report on Internal Control Over State Compliance](https://www.cliftonlarsonallen.com)

**Board of Directors**  
California Montessori Project  
San Juan Campus  
Carmichael, California  

**Report on Compliance**  
**Opinion on State Compliance**  
We have audited California Montessori Project’s (the School) compliance with the types of compliance requirements applicable to the School described in the 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel for the year ended June 30, 2023. The School’s applicable State compliance requirements are identified in the table below.

In our opinion, the School complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to above that are applicable to the School for the year ended June 30, 2023.

**Basis for Opinion**  
We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS); the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Our responsibilities under those standards and 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.

We are required to be independent of the School and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the School's compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.

**Responsibilities of Management for Compliance**  
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the School’s state programs.

**Auditors’ Responsibility for the Audit of Compliance**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the School's compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the School's compliance with the requirements of the government program as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the School's compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
- Obtain an understanding of the School's internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the School's internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit.

**Report on Internal Control over Compliance**  

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material noncompliance with a compliance requirement will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention from those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit, we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified.

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
**AGENDA ITEM:** G.12  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**MEETING DATE:** 06/25/2024  

## SUBJECT: Gateway International School 2022-2023 Annual Independent Financial Audit Report  

**DEPARTMENT:** Fiscal Services  

### ACTION REQUESTED:  
**Action:** The superintendent is recommending that the board receive the 2022-2023 Annual Independent Financial Audit Report for Gateway International School (GIS).  

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:  
Pursuant to Education Code 47604.32(d), the San Juan Unified School District (“District”), as the chartering authority, is required to monitor the fiscal condition of each charter school under its authority. The district is in receipt of fiscal information as provided by GIS.  

The district has, and will rely upon, the fiscal information as represented to the district by the charter school. Any and all monitoring requirements performed by the district will be based on the accuracy and completeness of the information as provided to the district.  

Gilbert CPAs (the charter school’s independent auditor) has expressed its opinion on the financial statements of Gateway Community Charters (“the Organization”) that “the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Organization as of June 30, 2023, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.”  

Education Code 47605(m) requires each charter school to annually provide a copy of its independent financial audit report to the chartering authority, the controller and county superintendent.  

According to the Organization’s 2022-2023 audit report, GIS’s ending cash and cash equivalent was $8,117,409, total revenues equaled $11,184,428 and total expenditures equaled $9,818,428 for the period ending June 30, 2022. The audit report reflects net assets for GIS of $10,977,181.  

Gateway Community Charters (GCC), the parent corporation for GIS, governs nine charters with combined ending cash and cash equivalent as of June 30, 2023, of $64,254,789, net assets of $110,645,268, and maintains a $3 million line of credit through Wells Fargo. GCC did not have an outstanding balance on the line of credit as of June 30, 2023.  

There were findings or questioned costs related to the basic financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023, that resulted in audit adjustments related to cash, fixed assets, payables and state aid revenue recognition. These findings were attributed to deficiencies in the monthly cash reconciliation process and errors in recording accounts payable and expenditures attributable to the fiscal year. This also affected the fixed asset encumbrances. Corrective action plans were initiated to correct these deficiencies. The prior year finding for a different GCC charter was corrected in the year ended June 30, 2023.

McClellan, California  

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**

**Opinion**  
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Gateway Community Charters (the Organization), a California non-profit public benefit corporation, which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the related statements of activities, functional expenses, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Organization as of June 30, 2023, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**Basis for Opinion**  
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Organization and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**  
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Organization's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**  

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards; **Government Auditing Standards**, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the **2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting**, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.  

In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, **Government Auditing Standards**, and the **2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting**, we:  

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Organization's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.  

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.  

- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Organization's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.  

**Supplementary Information**  

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The accompanying Supplementary Information, as listed in the Table of Contents, as required by the **2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting**, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel, and as required by Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, **Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards** are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and

relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole.  

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards  

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated December 15, 2023, on our consideration of the Organization’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the Organization’s internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Organization’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

### YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

1. **OPERATIONS**  
   Gateway Community Charters (the Organization) is a tax-exempt non-profit public benefit corporation that was established in 2003. The Organization governs nine unique charter schools. Five charter schools (CCCS, COA, FHS, SAVA, and HLA) were originally authorized by Grant Union High School District (now Twin Rivers Unified School District). Gateway International School (GIS) is authorized by the San Juan Unified School District. Empowering Possibilities International Charter is authorized by the Yolo County Office of Education. Sacramento Academic & Vocational Academy - SCUSD is authorized by the Sacramento City Unified School District. Sacramento Academic & Vocational Academy - EGUSD is authorized by the Elk Grove Unified School District. The charter schools are as follows:
   - Community Collaborative Charter School (CCCS)
   - Community Outreach Academy (COA)
   - Futures High School (FHS)
   - Sacramento Academic & Vocational Academy (SAVA – TRUSD)
   - Sacramento Academic & Vocational Academy (SCUSD – SAVA – SCUSD)
   - Higher Learning Academy (HLA)
   - Gateway International School (GIS)
   - Empowering Possibilities International Charter (EPIC)
   - Sacramento Academic & Vocational Academy – EGUSD (SAVA – EGUSD)

2. **SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**  
   **Basis of presentation** – The financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting and in conformity with professional standards applicable to not-for-profit entities. The Organization reports information regarding its financial position and activities according to two classes of net assets: net assets without donor restrictions and net assets with donor restrictions.

   **Cash and cash equivalents** – For financial statement purposes, the Organization considers investments with maturity at purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

   **Accounts receivable** represent amounts of which the Organization has an unconditional right to receive. Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to be collected from the outstanding balance.

   **Investments** are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses from the fluctuation of market value and realized gains and losses from the sale of investments are reflected in the statement of activities.

   **Property and equipment** with a value greater than $5,000 are capitalized at cost or fair value on the date of receipt in the case of donated property, and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to thirty years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lease term (including options) or the useful life. Major additions are capitalized, and repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the life of the assets are expensed. When assets are sold or retired, their cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, with the resulting gain or loss reflected in the statement of activities.

# GATEWAY COMMUNITY CHARTERS

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

**Leases** – The Organization determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Leases are included in right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities in the statement of financial position. ROU assets and lease liabilities reflect the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, and ROU assets are also adjusted for prepaid or accrued rent. The Organization uses the rate implicit in the lease if it is determinable. When the rate implicit in the lease is not determinable, the Organization has made an accounting policy election to use the risk-free rate at the lease commencement date, in lieu of its incremental borrowing rate to discount future lease payments. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease terms may include options to renew, extend or terminate to the extent they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The Organization does not report ROU assets and lease liabilities for its short-term leases (leases with a term of 12 months or less). Instead, the lease payments of those leases are reported as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

**Revenue recognition** – Program service fees are recognized as revenue when the services are performed. Payments received in advance are deferred to the applicable period in which the related services are performed.

The Organization receives grant funds that are considered conditional contributions and are not recorded or recognized until the applicable condition has been met, generally expenditure on costs allowable under the grant agreement, or satisfaction of performance obligations. Amounts received are recognized as revenue in the applicable period in which the qualifying expenses are incurred in compliance with specific grant provisions. Funds received in excess of expenditures incurred are recorded as deferred revenue. At June 30, 2023, $1,560,194 of grant funds are included in deferred revenue to be recognized in future periods. Additionally, as of June 30, 2023, the Organization had $5,528,216 of conditional contributions available to be recognized in future periods under such grants. The terms of the related contracts expire at various times from 2024 to 2026. In some cases, the Organization may not be able to access the full amount available under the agreement based on its activities and level of expenditures.

Contributions are recognized when cash, or other assets, or an unconditional promise to give is received. Conditional promises to give - that is, those with a measurable performance or other barrier and a right of return - are not recognized until the conditions on which they depend have been met.

Donor-restricted contributions are reported as increases in net assets without restrictions if the restriction expires in the reporting period in which the support is recognized. All other donor-restricted contributions are reported as increases in net assets with donor restrictions. When a restriction expires, net assets with donor restrictions are reclassified to net assets without donor restrictions and reported in the statement of activities as net assets released from restrictions. Restricted contributions that were initially classified as conditional due to a qualifying expense barrier are recognized as net assets without donor restrictions since the restriction is met simultaneously when the condition is released and the revenue is recognized.

**Functional allocation of expenses** – The cost of providing educational programs and other activities has been summarized on a functional basis in the statement of activities. The statement of functional expenses presents the natural classification of expenses by function. Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated among the program and supporting services benefited. The expenses that are allocated include rental, leases, repairs, noncapitalized improvements, and utilities, operations, and housekeeping services, and depreciation, which are allocated on a square footage basis, as well as salaries and wages, employee benefits, professional services, advertising, audit fees, catering, health.

permits, and legal fees, communications and postage, dues and memberships, travels and conferences, books and supplies, field trips, and special education costs, which are allocated on the basis of estimates of time and effort.

**Income taxes** – The Organization is publicly supported and has received tax-exempt status under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and Section 23701(d) of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. There is no unrelated taxable income and, accordingly, there is no provision for income taxes in these financial statements. The Organization has applied the accounting principles related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and has determined that there is no material impact on the financial statements.

**Use of estimates** – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.

**Recent accounting pronouncements** – Effective July 1, 2022, The Organization adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, Leases, using the modified retrospective approach with July 1, 2022 as the date of initial adoption. ASC 842 is intended to improve financial reporting of lease transactions by requiring entities that lease assets to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases that extend longer than 12 months. Key provisions in this guidance include additional disclosures surrounding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For leases existing at the transition date, The Organization applied the package of three transition practical expedients and therefore did not reassess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease, did not reassess lease classification, and did not reassess what qualifies as an initial direct cost. Additionally, The Organization applied the practical expedient to use hindsight for the purpose of determining the lease term.

Under the modified retrospective approach, the adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities of $22,199,389 as of July 1, 2022. There is no cumulative effect adjustment to net assets at the transition date.

**Subsequent events** have been reviewed through December 15, 2023, the date the financial statements were available to be issued. Management concluded that no material subsequent events have occurred since June 30, 2023 that require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

### 3. LIQUIDITY AND AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES

The Organization’s financial assets available within one year of the statement of financial position date for general expenditure are as follows at June 30, 2023:

**Current financial assets**  
Cash and cash equivalents  $ 64,254,789  
Accounts receivable  10,414,968  
Total financial assets, available within one year  74,669,757

Restrictions by board designations  
Restrictions by donors for purpose  
Total financial assets available for general expenditures within one year $ 55,078,199  

The Organization strives to maintain a reserve equivalent of 4-6 months of operating expenses. The California Department of Education currently requires a mandatory minimum 3% of operating expenditure reserve. The Organization will exceed this requirement and maintains a healthy reserve.

### 4. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Organization maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts that at times may exceed federally insured limits. At June 30, 2023, the book balance totaled $535,645 of which there was a bank balance of $562,161 that was held at one commercial bank. The bank balance exceeded the insured amount by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) by $312,161. The Organization has not experienced any losses in such accounts. Management believes the Organization is not exposed to any significant credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents.

The Organization also maintains cash in the County Treasury. The County pools these funds with those of other educational organizations in the county and invests the cash. These pooled funds are carried at cost which approximates fair value. The fair value of the Organization’s deposits in this pool as of June 30, 2023, as provided by the pool sponsor, was approximately $63,719,144. Interest earned is deposited quarterly into participating funds. Any investment losses are proportionately shared by all funds in the pool. The County is authorized to deposit cash and invest excess funds by California Government Code Section 53648 et. seq. The funds maintained by the County are either secured by federal depository insurance or collateralized.

### 5. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Accounts receivable at June 30, 2023 is $10,414,968. The balances are due entirely from grantor government agencies. Management deems all receivables to be collectible and no provision for doubtful accounts is recorded.

- Dividends and interest from investments: $ 147,504  
- Interest from cash held in County Treasury: $ 549,347  
- Net realized/unrealized gain: $ 519,890  

**Total:** $ 1,216,741  

### 7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. For some assets and liabilities, observable market transactions or market information might be available. For other assets and liabilities, observable market transactions and market information might not be available. However, the objective of a fair value measurement in both cases is the same—to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (that is, an exit price at the measurement date from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability).

In order to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs is used to measure fair value into three broad levels, as follows:

- **Level 1 Inputs**: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities.  
- **Level 2 Inputs**: Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.  
- **Level 3 Inputs**: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  

When a price for an identical asset or liability is not observable, a reporting entity measures fair value using another valuation technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Because fair value is a market-based measurement, it is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. As a result, a reporting entity’s intention to hold an asset or to settle or otherwise fulfill a liability is not relevant when measuring fair value.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

Following is a description of the valuation methods used for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in methodologies used at June 30, 2023.

**Corporate stocks and mutual funds:** Valued using quoted market prices which are available on an active market.

**Municipal and corporate bonds, real estate investments trusts, and U.S. government securities and obligations:** Valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which individual securities are traded.

The methods described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while the Organization believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

The following table set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Organization’s assets at fair value as of June 30, 2023:

### Plan Description
The Organization participates in the Schools Pool (the CalPERS Plan), a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee retirement system defined benefit pension plan administered by CalPERS. CalPERS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating entities within the State of California. CalPERS issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information for this plan. This report is available online at www.calpers.ca.gov.

### Benefits Provided
The benefits for the CalPERS Plan are established by contract, in accordance with the provisions of the California Public Employees’ Retirement Law (PERL). The benefits are based on members’ years of service, age, final compensation, and benefit formula. Benefits are provided for disability, death, and survivors of eligible members or beneficiaries. The California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA) made significant changes to the benefit structure that primarily affect members first hired to perform CalPERS creditable activities on or after January 1, 2013. As a result of PEPRA, the CalPERS Plan has two benefit structures: 1) CalPERS 2% at 55 – Members first hired on or before December 31, 2012, to perform CalPERS creditable activities, and 2) CalPERS 2% at 62 – Members first hired on or after January 1, 2013, to perform CalPERS creditable activities. To be eligible for service retirement, members hired prior to January 1, 2013, must be at least age 50 with a minimum of five years of CalPERS-credited service, while members hired after January 1, 2013, must be at least age 52 with a minimum of five years of service.

### Contributions
Section 20814(c) of the PERL requires that the employer contribution rates for all employers be determined on an annual basis by the actuary and shall be effective on the July 1 following notice of a change in the rate. Contribution rates for the CalPERS Plan are determined annually on an actuarial basis as of June 30 by CalPERS. The CalPERS Plan’s actuarially determined rate is the estimated amount necessary to finance the costs of benefits earned by employees during the year, with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued liability. Classic plan members, defined as a member who joined CalPERS prior to January 1, 2013, are required to contribute 7% of their salary. New members who joined CalPERS for the first time on or after January 1, 2013 are required to contribute 8% of their salary. The required employer contribution rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 was 25.37% of annual payroll and total contributions were $3,200,940. The contribution requirements of the plan members are established by state statute. For the fiscal year 2024, the Organization is required to contribute 26.68% of annual payroll.

### California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS):
- **Plan name:** California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS)
- **Plan’s EIN:** 94-6291617
- **Actuarial value of assets:** $257,537
- **Actuarial accrued liability:** $346,089
- **Funded status:** 65-80% funded

The actuarial value of assets and accrued liability are expressed in millions and are valued and measured as of June 30, 2022, the most recent actuarial valuation date.

### Plan Description
The Organization participates in the State Teachers’ Retirement Plan (the CalSTRS Plan), a cost-sharing multiple-employer public employee retirement system defined benefit pension plan administered by CalSTRS. CalSTRS acts as a common investment and administrative agent for participating entities within the State of California. CalSTRS issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information for this plan. This report is available online at www.calstrs.com.

### Benefits Provided
The benefits for the CalSTRS Plan are established by contract, in accordance with the provisions of the State Teachers' Retirement Law. Benefits are based on members’ years of service, age, final compensation, and a benefit formula. Benefits are provided for disability, death, and survivors of eligible members or beneficiaries. The PEPA made significant changes to the benefit structure that primarily affect members first hired to perform CalSTRS creditable activities on or after January 1, 2013. As a result of PEPR, the CalSTRS Plan has two benefit structures: 1) CalSTRS 2% at 60 – Members first hired on or before December 31, 2012, to perform CalSTRS creditable activities, and 2) CalSTRS 2% at 62 – Members first hired on or after January 1, 2013, to perform CalSTRS creditable activities. The 2 percent, also known as the age factor, refers to the percentage of final compensation received as a retirement benefit for each year of service credit. To be eligible for service retirement, members hired prior to January 1, 2013, must be at least age 60 with a minimum of five years of CalSTRS-credited service, while members hired after January 1, 2013, must be at least age 62 with five years of service.

### Contributions
Assembly Bill 1469 (AB 1469), signed into law as a part of the State of California’s (the State) 2014-15 budget, increases contributions to the CalSTRS Plan from members, employers, and the State over seven years, effective July 1, 2014. Starting with the fiscal year 2021-22 there may be additional annual adjustments not to exceed a maximum amount of 20.25%. Active plan members are required to contribute 10.205% or 10.25% of their salary, depending on when they were hired. The required employer contribution rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, was 19.10% of annual payroll and total contributions were $5,241,174. For the fiscal year 2024, the Organization is required to contribute 19.10% of annual payroll.

### 14. JOINT VENTURE
The Organization participates in a joint venture under a joint powers agreement (JPAs) with the California Charter School Joint Powers Authority, doing business as CharterSAFE (SAFE). SAFE arranges for and provides workers’ compensation, property, and liability insurance coverage for their members, respectively. The JPA is governed by boards consisting of a representative from each member. The board controls the operations of the JPA, including selection of management and approval of operating budgets, independent of any influence by the member beyond their representation on the board. Each member pays a premium commensurate with the level of coverage requested and shares surpluses and deficits proportionate to their participation in the JPA.

- **Total Revenues**: $ 39,799,089  
- **Total Expenses**: $ 38,186,250  
- **Net Increase in Net Assets**: $ 1,612,839  

### 15. CONTINGENCIES
The Organization has received federal and state funds for specific purposes that are subject to review and audit by the grantor agencies. Although such audits could generate expenditure disallowances under terms of the grants, it is believed that any required reimbursement will not be material.

The Organization may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities, including employment matters. Management believes that any liability that may ultimately result from the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Organization.

### 16. RELATED PARTY
Gateway Community Charters Foundation (Foundation) is a separate not-for-profit entity that raises contributions for the benefit of the Organization. Five of the Foundation's board members are to be chosen by the Organization, in accordance with the Foundation's bylaws. In addition, the Organization's superintendent and one board member sit on the Foundation's board. In the year ended June 30, 2023, the Foundation made contributions to the Organization totaling $26,942.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

To the Board of Directors  
Gateway Community Charters  
McClellan, California  

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the consolidated financial statements of Gateway Community Charters, a California non-profit public benefit corporation (the Organization), which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the related statements of activities, functional expenses, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated December 15, 2023.

## Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the Organization’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Organization’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Organization’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of the internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. We identified a certain deficiency in internal control, described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs as item 2023-001 that we consider to be a material weakness.

**Report on Compliance and Other Matters**  

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Organization’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that is required to be reported under Government Auditing Standard.  

**Organization’s Response to Finding**  

Government Auditing Standards requires the auditor to perform limited procedures on the Organization’s response to the findings identified in our audit and described in the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs. The Organization’s response was not subjected to the other auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on the response.  

**Purpose of This Report**  

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the Organization’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the Organization’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH 2022-23 GUIDE FOR ANNUAL AUDITS OF K-12 LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES AND STATE COMPLIANCE REPORTING

To the Board of Directors  
Gateway Community Charters  
McClellan, California  

## Report on State Compliance

### Opinion on State Compliance

We have audited Gateway Community Charters’ (the Organization) compliance with the types of compliance requirements identified as subject to audit in the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel identified in the schedule below for the year ended June 30, 2023.

In our opinion, the Organization complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to above for the year ended June 30, 2023.

### Basis for Opinion on State Compliance

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Our responsibilities under those standards, and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.

We are required to be independent of the Organization and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on compliance for each applicable state program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the Organization’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.

### Responsibilities of Management for Compliance

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the Organization’s state programs.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the Organization’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the Organization’s compliance with the requirements of State Compliance as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the Organization’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
- Obtained an understanding of the Organization’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion of effectiveness of the Organization’s internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses over compliance that we identified during the audit.

In connection with the requirements referred to above, we selected and tested transactions and records to determine the Organization’s compliance with the applicable programs identified below:

**Compliance Requirements** | **Procedures Performed**

California Clean Energy Jobs Act | Not Applicable
After/Before School Education and Safety Program | Yes

**Report on Internal Control over Compliance**  

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified.

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

To the Board of Directors  
Gateway Community Charters  
McClellan, California  

**Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program**

**Opinion on Each Major Federal Program**

We have audited Gateway Community Charter’s (the Organization) compliance with the types of compliance requirements identified as subject to audit in the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the Organization’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2023. The Organization’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.

In our opinion, the Organization complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2023.

**Basis for Opinion on Each Major Federal Program**

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Our responsibilities under those standards and the Uniform Guidance are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.

We are required to be independent of the Organization and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the Organization’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.

**Responsibilities of Management for Compliance**

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the Organization’s federal programs.

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the Organization’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, *Government Auditing Standards*, and the Uniform Guidance will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the Organization’s compliance with the requirements of each major federal program as a whole.

- Obtain an understanding of the Organization’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Organization’s internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit.

**Report on Internal Control over Compliance**

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant

deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified.  

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.  

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

### FINANCIAL STATEMENT FINDINGS

**2023-001 FINANCIAL CLOSE – CDDC #30000**

**Finding:**

One element of an entity’s internal control over financial reporting is the ability to detect misstatement in the financial statements independent of the audit process and produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Adjustments arising from the audit of an organization’s financial statements are generally an indication that internal controls over financial reporting are not functioning properly. Adjustments were required related to cash, fixed assets, payables and state aid revenue recognition as a result of identified errors during audit procedures. These adjustments resulted in a decrease to the revolving cash account of $927,815, decrease to fixed assets of $138,890, decrease to payables of $138,890, and a decrease to state aid revenue (adjustments and prior year recomputations) of $927,815.

**Criteria:**

Accrual based accounting in accordance with GAAP for not-for-profit organizations.

**Cause:**

State aid revenue recognition and fixed asset activity was not sufficiently analyzed and reviewed to ensure proper accounting treatment.

**Questioned Cost:**

No questioned costs or misstatement of ADA were noted related to this finding and errors identified were corrected by management.

**Recommendation:**

We recommend that the Organization evaluate the financial policies and procedures for monthly and year-end closing processes to ensure the financial records and financial statements are maintained in accordance with GAAP.

**Organization’s Corrective Action Plan:**

**Corrective Action on the Revolving Account:**

The $927,815 decrease in cash was attributed to deficiencies in the monthly cash reconciliation process. In the 2022-23 fiscal year, the reconciliation of the revolving cash account was inadequate, as it only reconciled the bank statement to the QuickBooks ledger, neglecting to incorporate monthly activity into the QSS general ledger. The Business Technician prepared the reconciliation, which was then submitted to the Director of Business Services for review and approval. At year-end close, a deficiency in the review process was identified, with no final check of the revolving cash account's June 30th balance in the QSS general ledger.

Effective 2023-2024 school year, the Director of Fiscal Service with the support of the Chief Business Official will be reconciling the QSS general ledger in order to mirror the activity that is happening in the revolving account. In December 2023, the Director of Fiscal Services, Chief Business Official, and the
<!-- Page 301 -->
# GATEWAY COMMUNITY CHARTERS

## FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS  
### YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

Business Technician that manages the reconciliation will work to get the general ledger in QSS aligned to the Wells Fargo Bank statement and the QuickBooks balance through December 2023. In addition, moving forward, effective January 2024 the bank reconciliation of Quick Books to the bank statement will include the revised process in order to keep the QSS general ledger reconciled monthly as well.

Furthermore, all deposits initially made into the revolving account, subsequently deposited into the cash account at SCOE, will explicitly note the 9130 revolving cash account in the cash deposit. Similarly, expenditures initially paid from the revolving account, later submitted as accounts payable batches with SCOE, will be duly documented with reference to the 9130 revolving cash account with a journal.

### Corrective Action on Fixed Assets

COA Elementary had an intercom/critical communication system installed and completed on August 17th for a total of $138,890. It was entered incorrectly into the system as an estimated payable of 22-23 but should have been recorded as an expenditure in 23-24.

In January 2024, Chief Business Official, Director, and Supervisor of Fiscal Services will be training and expanding the knowledge of our accounts payable team to ensure that they understand that all invoicing received after 6/30 and before closing of the books should be reviewed for dates received and work completed before determining what fiscal year it should be recorded, regardless of what fiscal year the purchase order was for. In addition to January 2024 training to discuss current year audit findings, a refresher training will be given to staff in July 2024 to ensure this information is fresh in their minds.

During the closing process July 2024- September 2024, the accounts payable staff will review all outstanding fixed asset encumbrances and check the status with the school site or facility staff. If the purchase order has been fulfilled, but no invoice has been received, the vendor will be contacted for outstanding invoices for immediate payment and make sure the invoice is paid in the correct year, by setting up an estimated payable. For this particular finding the purchase order had not been fulfilled and therefore the purchase order should have been rolled into the next year, with no estimated payable set up.

Moving forward at year end close effective June 2024, the Supervisor of Fiscal Services will review all items posted to the general ledger in September of each year, to ensure that the assets posted are accounted for in the correct year.

![San Juan Unified School District Agenda Item G.13](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=San+Juan+Unified+School+District+Agenda+Item+G.13)

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT**  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  

**AGENDA ITEM:** G.13  
**MEETING DATE:** 06/25/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Golden Valley Orchard Charter and Golden Valley River Charter 2022-2023 Annual Independent Financial Audit Report  

**DEPARTMENT:** Fiscal Services  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board receive the 2022-2023 Audit Report for Golden Valley Orchard Charter (GVO) and Golden Valley River Charter (GVR).  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Pursuant to Education Code 47604.32(d), the San Juan Unified School District (“District”), as the chartering authority, is required to monitor the fiscal condition of each charter school under its authority. The district is in receipt of fiscal information as provided by GVO and GVR.  

The district has, and will rely upon, the fiscal information as represented to the district by the charter school. Any and all monitoring requirements performed by the district will be based on the accuracy and completeness of the information as provided to the district.  

Wilkinson Hadley King & Co, LLP (the charter school’s independent auditor) has expressed its opinion that “the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal as of June 30, 2023, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the fiscal year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.”  

Education Code 47605(m) requires each charter school to annually provide a copy of its independent financial audit report to the chartering authority, the controller and county superintendent.  

The following information is reported in the Golden Valley Charter’s 2022-2023 audit report for the period ending June 30, 2023: GVO’s ending cash and cash equivalent was $0, total revenues equaled $3,495,134, total expenditures equaled $3,494,138 and net assets were $140,116. GVR’s ending cash and cash equivalent was $250,702, total revenues equaled $4,371,269, total expenditures equaled $4,370,267 and reported net assets were $889,964.  

In 2015, Golden Valley Charter Schools for Educational Renewal, formerly Golden Valley Charter School of Sacramento, transitioned from a single site to a central office of a charter management organization in order to support operating multiple schools. Two of the charter schools, Golden Valley River and Golden Valley Orchard, were granted by the San Juan Unified School District. A third charter school, granted by another district, was closed during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.  

There were no findings or questioned costs related to the basic financial statements or state awards for GVO or GVR for the year ended June 30, 2023. A prior year finding is still noted for the closed charter’s failure to meet the required number of instructional minutes or days under Ed code 47612 due to the school closure.

To the Board of Trustees of  
Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal  

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**  

**Opinion**  
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal (a nonprofit organization), which comprise the statement of consolidated financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of activities, functional expenses, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.  

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal as of June 30, 2023, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

**Basis for Opinion**  
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal and to meet our ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.  

**Emphasis of Matter – Changes in Accounting Principle and Policy**  
As described in Note A to the financial statements, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, Golden Valley Charter Schools for Educational Renewal adopted new accounting guidance, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842, Leases. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.  

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**  
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter.

![Attachment 1](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Auditor's+Responsibilities+for+the+Audit+of+the+Financial+Statements)

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and Government Auditing Standards, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

**Supplementary Information**

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The additional accompanying supplementary information, as identified in the Table of Contents and as required by the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the accompanying supplementary information, as identified in the Table of Contents, are fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole.

# Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal
## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
### Year Ended June 30, 2023

### A. Principal Activity and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

#### Organization Structure

**Charter Schools**

Golden Valley Charter Schools for Educational Renewal (the Organization) is a non-profit public benefit corporation. The Organization petitioned and was approved through San Juan Unified School District for a charter. The mission of the Organization is that each student becomes a self-directed, life-long learner with the support of a community of peers, teachers, and parents. The Organization envisions that through a whole-child approach to learning, student curiosity, enthusiasm and effort will enable all children to reach the fullest expression of their individual potential.

The Organization operates two charter schools. Golden Valley River [#0946] is a K-8 charter school and was granted a charter number under the sponsorship of the San Juan Unified School District for a charter in July 2007. Golden Valley Orchard [#1728] is a K-8 charter school that was granted its charter by the San Juan Unified School District in May 2015. They were formed pursuant to the terms of the Charter Schools Act (the Act) of 1992, as amended. The Act authorized the formation of charter schools for the purpose, among others, of developing new, innovative, and more flexible ways of educating children within the public school system. In 2015, Golden Valley Charter Schools for Educational Renewal transitioned from a single site to a central office of a charter management organization in order to support operating multiple schools.

#### Home Office

The home office location is utilized by the back office, CSMC, to handle intercompany transactions for the entity as a whole. It is not a separate entity, the assets and liabilities that it has belong to the Organization.

#### Basis of Accounting

The financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as applicable to not-for-profit organizations. The Organization uses the accrual basis of accounting, under which revenues are recognized when they are earned, and expenditures are recognized in the accounting period in which the liability is incurred.

#### Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Organization considers all cash and highly liquid financial instruments with original maturities of three months or less, which are neither held for nor restricted by donors for long-term purposes, to be cash and cash equivalents.

#### Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable consist primarily of non-interest bearing amounts due to the Organization for federal, state, and local grants and contracts receivable. The amounts in accounts receivable are considered fully collectable and as such there has not been an allowance for uncollectable accounts or discount established for the Organization.

## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
### Year Ended June 30, 2023

### Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses are recorded to account for expenditures during the benefiting period.

### Property and Equipment
The Organization records property and equipment additions over $5,000 at cost, or if donated, at fair value on the date of donation. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 3 to 30 years, or in the case of capitalized leased assets or leasehold improvements, the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is included in the statements of activities. Costs of maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the useful lives of the respective assets are expensed in the current period.

The Organization reviews the carrying values of property and equipment for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. When considered impaired an impairment loss is recognized to the extent carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. There were no indicators of asset impairment during the year ended June 30, 2023.

### Investments
The Organization records investment purchases at cost, or if donated, at fair value on the date of donation. Thereafter, investments are reported at their fair values on the statement of financial position. Net investment return/(loss) is reported in the statement of activities and consists of interest and dividend income, realized and unrealized capital gains and losses, less external and direct internal investment expenses.

### Net Assets
Net assets, revenues, gains, and losses are classified based on the existence or absence of donor or grantor-imposed restrictions. Accordingly, net assets and changes therein are classified and reported as follows:

**Net Assets Without Donor Restrictions** – Net assets available for use in general operations and not subject to donor (or certain grantor) restrictions.

**Net Assets With Donor Restrictions** – Net assets subject to donor (or certain grantor) imposed restrictions. Some donor-imposed restrictions are temporary in nature, such as those that will be met by the passage of time or other events specified by the donor. Other donor-imposed restrictions are perpetual in nature, where the donor stipulates those resources be maintained in perpetuity. Donor-imposed restrictions are released when a restriction expires, that is, when the stipulated time has elapsed, when the stipulated purpose for which the resource was restricted has been fulfilled, or both.

### Year Ended June 30, 2023

### Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue arises when potential revenue does not meet both the “measurable” and “available” criteria for recognition in the current period or when resources are received by the Organization prior to the occurrence of qualifying expenditures. In subsequent periods, when both revenue recognition criteria are met, or when the Organization has a legal claim to the resources, the liability for unearned revenue is removed from the combined balance sheet and revenue is recognized.

### Compensated Absences
Accumulated unpaid employee vacation benefits are recognized as liabilities of the Organization. The balance of the liabilities is recognized in the financial statements at year end.

### Revenue and Revenue Recognition
The Organization recognizes revenue from sales when the products are transferred, and services are provided. The Organization records special events revenue equal to the cost of direct benefits to donors, and contribution revenue for the difference. Contributions are recognized when cash, securities or other assets, an unconditional promise to give, or notification of a beneficial interest is received. Conditional promises to give, that is, those with a measurable performance or other entry, and a right of return, are not recognized until the conditions on which they depend have been substantially met. Some federal, state, and local contracts and grants are conditioned upon certain performance requirements and the incurrence of allowable qualifying expense. In such cases the revenue is recognized once all performance requirements have been met.

### Donated Services and In-Kind Contributions
Volunteers contribute significant amounts of time to our program services, administration, and fundraising and developing activities; however, the financial statements do not reflect the value of these contributed services because they do not meet recognition criteria prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles.

### Advertising
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and approximated $43,538 during the year ended June 30, 2023.

### Functional Allocation of Expenses
The costs of program and supporting services activities have been summarized on a functional basis in the statement of activities. The statement of functional expenses presents the natural classification detail of expenses by function. Accordingly, certain costs have been allocated among the program and supporting services benefited.

# Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal
## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
### Year Ended June 30, 2023

### Income Taxes
The Organization is a 509(a)(1) publicly supported non-profit organization that is exempt from income taxes under Sections 501(a) and 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Organization is also exempt from California franchise or income tax under Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. The Organization may be subject to tax on income which is not related to its exempt purpose. For the year ended June 30, 2023, no such unrelated business income was reported and, therefore, no provision for income taxes has been made.

The Organization follows provisions of uncertain tax positions as addressed in ASC 958. The Organization recognizes accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision, when applicable. There are no amounts accrued in the financial statements related to uncertain tax positions for the year ended June 30, 2023.

### Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Organization to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and those differences could be material.

### Financial Instruments and Credit Risk
The Organization manages deposit concentration risk by placing cash, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit with financial institutions believed by the Organization to be creditworthy. At times, amounts on deposit may exceed insured limits or include uninsured investments in money market mutual funds. To date, the Organization has not experienced losses in any of these accounts. Credit risk associated with contributions receivable is considered to be limited due to high historical collection rates and because substantial portions of the outstanding amounts are due from government agencies.

### LCFF Revenues and Payments in Lieu of Property Taxes
The Organization’s primary funding source is a combination of local property taxes and state revenues. The California Department of Education computes the local control funding formula (LCFF) on statewide charter school rates multiplied by each schools’ average daily attendance (ADA) as reported at the second principal apportionment period (P2). The result is then reduced by property tax revenues transferred from the District to each school, which is funding in lieu of property taxes, and education protection account funds paid by the state under Proposition 30. The remaining balance is paid from the state general fund, in the form of LCFF State Aid. LCFF funding sources, inclusive of state and local sources, made up 73% of the Organization’s revenue.

The Organization is not at risk of losing these funding sources, as long as each school maintains a steady level of ADA, as these funding sources are mandated by the California State Constitution to fund schools.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)**  
**Year Ended June 30, 2023**  

**H. Employee Retirement System**  

Qualified employees are covered under multiple-employer defined benefit pension plans by agencies of the State of California. Certificated employees are members of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) and classified employees are members of the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS). The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:

a. Assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of the other participating employers.

b. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.

c. If the Organization chooses to stop participating in some of its multi-employer plans, the Organization may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.

The Organization’s participation in these plans for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, is outlined in the table below. The “EIN/Pension Plan Number” column provides the Employee Identification Number (EIN) and the three digit plan number, if applicable. Unless otherwise noted, the most recent Pension Protection Act (PPA) zone status available in 2023, 2022 and 2021 is for the plan’s year-end at June 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The zone status is based on information that the Organization received from the plan and is certified by the plan's actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded. The “FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented” column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented.

**Period to Period Comparability:**

Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal increased in CalSTRS contributions from 2021 to 2022 by 34.81% followed by an increase in 2023 of 58.85%. Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal increased in CalPERS contributions from 2021 to 2022 by 94.08% followed by an increase in 2023 of 3.54%. The increase in both STRS and PERS is largely due to an increase in participants combined with an increase in salaries and contribution rates.

| Pension Fund | EIN/ Pension Plan Number | Zone Status | FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented | Contributions | Number of Employees | Surcharge Imposed |
|--------------|--------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
|              |                          |             |                                   | 2023           | 2022                | 2021               |

Copies of the CalPERS annual financial report may be obtained from the CalPERS Executive Office, 400 P Street, Sacramento, California 95814.

Active plan members are required to contribute 7% of their salary and the Organization is required to contribute an actuarially determined rate.

To the Board of Directors  
Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal  

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal (a nonprofit organization), which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the related statements of activities, functional expenses, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated December 15, 2023.

**Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting**  

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements, on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified.

![Report on Compliance and Other Matters](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Report+on+Compliance+and+Other+Matters)

**Report on Compliance and Other Matters**  
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Purpose of this Report**  
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Educational Renewal’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Golden Valley Charter Schools for Educational Renewal’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

![Independent Auditor’s Report on State Compliance and on Internal Control Over State Compliance](attachment1)

**To the Board of Directors**  
Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal  

**Report on Compliance for Applicable State Programs**  

**Opinion on Each Applicable State Program**  
We have audited Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s compliance with the requirements specified in the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, prescribed in Title 5, California Code of Regulations, Section 19810 applicable to Golden Valley Charter Schools for Educational Renewal’s statutory requirements identified below for the year ended June 30, 2023.  

In our opinion, Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its applicable state programs for the year ended June 30, 2023.  

**Basis for Opinion on Each Applicable State Program**  
We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America; the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, prescribed in Title 5, California Code of Regulations, Section 19810 (the Audit Guide). Our responsibilities under those standards and the Audit Guide are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.  

We are required to be independent of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal and to meet our ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on compliance for each applicable state program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.  

**Responsibilities of Management for Compliance**  
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s state programs.  

**Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance**  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, Government Auditing Standards, and the Audit Guide will always detect material noncompliance when it exists.  

**342**
<!-- Page 343 -->
![Attachment 1](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+1)

The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s compliance with the requirements of each applicable state program as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, Government Auditing Standards, and the Audit Guide, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
- Obtain an understanding of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s internal control over state compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Audit Guide, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Select and test transactions and records to determine the Golden Valley Charter Schools for Education Renewal’s compliance with the state laws and regulations applicable to the following items:

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit.

# Report on Internal Control over State Compliance

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a state program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a state program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a state program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified.

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Audit Guide. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
**AGENDA ITEM:** G.14  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**MEETING DATE:** 06/25/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Options For Youth - San Juan Charter School 2022-2023 Annual Independent Financial Audit Report  
**DEPARTMENT:** Fiscal Services  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board receive the 2022-2023 Annual Independent Financial Audit Report for Options For Youth - San Juan Charter School (OFY).  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
Pursuant to Education Code 47604.32(d), the San Juan Unified School District (“District”), as the chartering authority, is required to monitor the fiscal condition of each charter school under its authority. The district is in receipt of fiscal information as provided by OFY.  

The district has, and will rely upon, the fiscal information as represented to the district by the charter school. Any and all monitoring requirements performed by the district will be based on the accuracy and completeness of the information as provided to the district.  

CliftonLarsonAllen LLP (the charter school’s independent auditor) has expressed its opinion for Options for Youth – San Juan, Inc (“the company”) that “the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the School as of June 30, 2022, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.”  

Education Code 47605(m) requires each charter school to annually provide a copy of its independent financial audit report to the chartering authority, the controller and county superintendent.  

According to the OFY 2022-2023 audit report, ending cash was $10,829,873, total revenues equaled $14,139,865 and total expenditures equaled $13,686,783 for the period ending June 30, 2023. The audit report reflects net assets of $8,008,545.  

OFY has a $1,000,000 line of credit with PMB, an affiliate company, secured by program revenue, that expires on June 12, 2024. As of June 30, 2023, there was no outstanding balance.  

The findings or questioned costs related to the basic financial statements or state awards for the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2024, were for Monitoring Revenue Recognition Related to Deferred Revenue that should have been reclassified as Accounts Payable.

**Board of Directors**  
Options for Youth - San Juan, Inc.  
Pasadena, California  

**Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements**  

**Opinion**  
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Options for Youth - San Juan, Inc. (the School), a California nonprofit public benefit corporation, which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the related statements of activities, cash flows, and functional expenses for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.  

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the School as of June 30, 2023, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

**Basis for Opinion**  
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of Options for Youth - San Juan, Inc. and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  

**Change in Accounting Principle**  
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in 2023 the School adopted new accounting guidance for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability for all operating and finance leases with lease terms greater than one year. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.  

**Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements**  
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

# Board of Directors  
Options for Youth - San Juan, Inc.  

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the School's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date the financial statements are available to be issued.  

## Auditors’ Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore, is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.  

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we:  

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the School’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.  
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.  
- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the School's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.

**Emphasis of Matters**  
**Concentration**  
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the School provides services to students under the charter with San Juan Unified School District which amounted to 100% of revenues reported for the year ended June 30, 2023. The loss of charter authorization could have a material adverse effect on the School. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

**Supplementary Information**  
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the School’s financial statements as a whole. The accompanying supplementary schedules, as identified in the table of contents, is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, except for the portion marked “unaudited”, was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole. The Local Education Agency Organization Structure, which is marked “unaudited”, has not been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on it.

**Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards**  
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued a report dated December 13, 2023 on our consideration of the School’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the School’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
JUNE 30, 2023  

## NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION AND MISSION  
The Options for Youth - San Juan Charter School is operated by Options for Youth - San Juan, Inc. (the School) doing business as Options for Youth San Juan (OFY). The School is a nonprofit public benefit corporation. The School petitioned San Juan Unified School District (the District) for a charter and was approved by the State of California Department of Education on July 14, 1999. The District has granted the Charter through June 30, 2014. During the 2013-2014 school year, the San Juan Unified School renewed the Charter School Petition for an additional five-year term commencing on July 1, 2014 and continuing until June 30, 2023. The School charter was extended through June 30, 2024.

The School provides independent study programs for individuals not attending traditional school. The state apportionment revenues generated by the Average Daily Attendance (ADA) support the School. Actual costs of supervisorial oversight, not to exceed 1% of state apportionment revenues, are paid to the San Juan Unified School District in agreement with the School’s charter.

The School’s mission is to provide meaningful educational options by partnering with the community to empower its students to become responsible individuals and life-long learners who work with integrity to achieve their goals and dreams. A volunteer board of directors governs the School.

## NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

**Basis of Accounting**  
The financial statements have been prepared on the accrual method of accounting and accordingly, reflect all significant receivables and liabilities.

**Basis of Presentation**  
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

**Use of Estimates**  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.

**Functional Allocation of Expenses**  
Costs of providing the School’s programs and other activities have been presented in the statement of functional expenses. During the year, such costs are accumulated into separate groupings as either direct or indirect. Indirect or shared costs are allocated among program and support services by a method that best measures the relative degree of benefit.

## NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

### Cash and Cash Equivalents
The School defines its cash and cash equivalents to include only cash on hand, demand deposits, and liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.

### Security Deposits
Security deposits are paid in advance for various lease agreements for the School’s sites.

### Net Asset Classes
Net assets, revenues, gains, and losses are classified based on the existence or absence of donor or grantor-imposed restrictions. Accordingly, net assets and changes therein are classified and reported as follows:

- **Net Assets Without Donor Restrictions** – Net assets available for use in general operations and not subject to donor (or certain grantor) restrictions.

- **Net Assets With Donor Restrictions** – Net assets subject to donor- (or certain grantor-) imposed restrictions. Some donor-imposed restrictions are temporary in nature, such as those that will be met by the passage of time or other events specified by the donor. Other donor-imposed restrictions are perpetual in nature, where the donor stipulates that resources be maintained in perpetuity. Donor-imposed restrictions are released when a restriction expires, that is, when the stipulated time has elapsed, when the stipulated purpose for which the resource was restricted has been fulfilled, or both.

We report contributions restricted by donors as increases in net assets without donor restrictions if the restrictions expire (that is, when a stipulated time restriction ends or purpose restriction is accomplished) in the reporting period in which the revenue is recognized. All other donor-restricted contributions are reported as increases in net assets with donor restrictions. When a restriction expires, net assets with donor restrictions are reclassified to net assets without donor restrictions and reported in the consolidated statements of activities as net assets released from restrictions.

### Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable primarily represent amounts due from state and local governments as of June 30, 2023. Management believes that all receivables are fully collectible; therefore, no provisions for uncollectible accounts were recorded.

### Property, Plant, and Equipment
It is the School’s policy to capitalize individual property and equipment purchases over $25,000. Lesser amounts are expensed. Purchased property and equipment is capitalized at cost. Donations of property and equipment are recorded as contributions at their estimated fair value. Such donations are reported as unrestricted contributions unless the donor has restricted the donated asset to a specific purpose. Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method, over 3 to 5 years.

(A CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION) NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JUNE 30, 2023](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=OPTIONS+FOR+YOUTH+-+SAN+JUAN,+INC.+(A+CALIFORNIA+NONPROFIT+PUBLIC+BENEFIT+CORPORATION)+NOTES+TO+FINANCIAL+STATEMENTS+JUNE+30,+2023)

## NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

### Leases
The School determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in right-of-use (ROU) assets – operating and lease liability – operating, and finance leases are included in right-of-use (ROU) assets – financing and lease liability – financing in the statement of financial position.

ROU assets represent the School’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the School’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the School will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The School has elected to recognize payments for short-term leases with a lease term of 12 months or less as expense as incurred and these leases are not included as lease liabilities or right of use assets on the balance sheet.

The individual lease contracts do not provide information about the discount rate implicit in the lease. Therefore, the School has elected to use a risk-free rate determined using a period comparable with that of the lease term for computing the present value of all lease liabilities.

The School has elected not to separate nonlease components from lease components and instead accounts for each separate lease component and the nonlease component as a single lease component.

### Income Taxes
The School is exempt from income taxes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and classified by the Internal Revenue Service as other than a private foundation. It is also exempt from state franchise and income taxes under Section 23701(d) of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been reflected in these financial statements. The United States federal and the state of California have statutes of limitations that generally range from 3 to 4 years. No open tax years are currently under examination.

### Revenue Recognition
Amounts received from the California Department of Education are conditional and recognized as revenue by the School based on the average daily attendance (ADA) of students. Revenue that is restricted is recorded as an increase in net assets without donor restriction, if the restriction expires in the reporting period in which the revenue is recognized. All other restricted revenues are reported as increases in net assets with donor restriction.

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

**Contributions**  
All contributions are considered to be available for use unless specifically restricted by the donor. Amounts received that are restricted to specific use or future periods are reported as contributions with donor restrictions. Restricted contributions that are received and released in the same period are reported as promises to give without donor restrictions. Unconditional promises to give expected to be received in one year or less are recorded at net realizable value. Unconditional promises to give expected to be received in more than one year are recorded at fair value at the date of the promise. Conditional promises to give are not recognized until they become unconditional, that is, when the conditions on which they depend are substantially met.

**Conditional Grants**  
Grants and contracts that are conditioned upon the performance of certain requirements or the incurrence of allowable qualifying expenses are recognized as revenues in the period in which the conditions are met. Amounts received are recognized as revenue when the School has incurred expenditures in compliance with specific contract or grant provisions. Amounts received prior to incurring qualifying expenditures are reported as deferred revenues in the statement of financial position. As of June 30, 2023, the School has conditional grants of $2,755,024, of which $2,326,145 is recognized as deferred revenue in the statement of financial position because conditions have not yet been met.

**Compensated Absences**  
Accumulated unpaid employee vacation benefits are recognized as a liability of the School. The current portion of the liability, if material, is recognized at year-end. The entire compensated absences liability is reported on the statement of financial position. After 90 days of employment, full-time employees employed for accrue 17 days of paid vacation per 12-month period, to a maximum balance of 240 hours. After five years of employment, these amounts increase to 22 days per 12-month period to a maximum of 300 hours.

**Concentration**  
The School provides services to students under the charter with the San Juan Unified School District, which amounted to 100% of total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2023. The School performs periodic credit evaluations and generally does not require collateral.

**Property Taxes**  
Secured property taxes attach as an enforceable lien on property as of January 1. Taxes are levied on September 1 and are payable in two installments on or before November 1 and February 1. Unsecured property taxes are not a lien against real property and are payable in one installment on or before August 31. The County bills and collects property taxes for all taxing agencies within the County and distributes these collections to the various agencies. The sponsor agency of the School is required by law to provide in-lieu property tax payments on a monthly basis, from August through July. The amount paid per month is based upon an allocation per student, with a specific percentage to be paid each month.

## NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

### Adoption of New Accounting Standard - Leases
In February 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This new standard increases transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities on the statement of financial position. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.

The School adopted the requirements of the guidance effective July 1, 2022, and has elected to apply the provisions of this standard to the beginning of the period of adoption.

The School has elected to adopt the package of practical expedients available in the year of adoption.

### Subsequent Events
The School has evaluated subsequent events through December 13, 2023, the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

## NOTE 3 LIQUIDITY AND AVAILABILITY
Financial assets available for general expenditure are those without donor or other restrictions limiting their use within one year of the statement of financial position date. Financial assets available for general expenditures comprise cash and cash equivalents and grants receivable for the total amount of $13,056,613.

As part of its liquidity management plan, the School monitors liquidity required and cash flows to meet operating needs on a monthly basis. The School structures its financial assets to be available as general expenditures, liabilities and other obligations come due.

## NOTE 4 CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK
The School maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts at various institutions. Accounts at these institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000. At times, cash in these accounts exceeds the insured amounts. The School has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
### JUNE 30, 2023  

### NOTE 10 FUNCTIONALIZED EXPENSES  
The financial statements report certain categories of expenses that are attributed to more than one program or supporting function. Therefore, expenses require allocation on a reasonable basis that is consistently applied. The expenses that are allocated include management fees, consulting service and travel, which are allocated on the basis of contractual terms.  

### NOTE 11 CONTINGENCIES, RISKS, AND UNCERTAINTIES  
The School has received state and federal funds for specific purposes that are subject to review and audit by the grantor agencies. Although such audits could generate disallowances under terms of the grants, it is believed that any required reimbursement would not be material.  

In the normal course of business, the School is subject to legal claims. After consultation with the School’s legal counsel, management of the School is of the opinion that liabilities, if any, arising from such claims would not have a material effect on the School’s financial position.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

Board of Directors  
Options for Youth - San Juan, Inc.  
Pasadena, California  

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of Options for Youth - San Juan, Inc. (the School), a nonprofit California public benefit corporation, which comprise the statement of financial position as of June 30, 2023, and the related statements of activities, statement of functional expenses and cash flows for the year then ended, the related notes to the financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated December 13, 2023.

## Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered the School’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing the audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the School’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the School’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that have not been identified.

**Report on Compliance and Other Matters**  
As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the School’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Purpose of this Report**  
The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

**Board of Directors**  
Options for Youth - San Juan, Inc.  
Pasadena, California  

**Report on Compliance**  
**Opinion on State Compliance**  
We have audited Options for Youth - San Juan, Inc.’s (the School) compliance with the types of compliance requirements applicable to the School described in the 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel for the year ended June 30, 2023. The School's applicable State compliance requirements are identified in the table below.

In our opinion, the School complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to above that are applicable to the School for the year ended June 30, 2023.

**Basis for Opinion**  
We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS); the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel. Our responsibilities under those standards and 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.

We are required to be independent of the School and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the School's compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.

**Responsibilities of Management for Compliance**  
Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the School’s government programs.

**Auditors’ Responsibility for the Audit of Compliance**  
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the School's compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore, is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the School's compliance with the requirements of the government program as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel, we:  
• Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.  
• Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the School’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  
• Obtain an understanding of the School's internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, published by the Education Audit Appeals Panel, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the School's internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.  

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit.  

**Compliance Requirements Tested**  
In connection with the audit referred to above, we selected and tested transactions and records to determine the School's compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to the following items:

# Report on Internal Control over Compliance

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material noncompliance with a compliance requirement will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention from those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit, we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified.

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the 2022-2023 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

# SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  

**AGENDA ITEM:** G.15  
**MEETING DATE:** 06/25/2024  

## SUBJECT: 
Visions In Education Charter School 2022-2023 Annual Independent Financial Audit Report  

## DEPARTMENT: 
Fiscal Services  

## ACTION REQUESTED:  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board receive the 2022-2023 Annual Independent Financial Audit Report for Visions In Education Charter School (VIE).  

## RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:  
Pursuant to Education Code 47604.32(d), the San Juan Unified School District (“District”), as the chartering authority, is required to monitor the fiscal condition of each charter school under its authority. The district is in receipt of fiscal information as provided by VIE.  

The district has, and will rely upon, the fiscal information as represented to the district by the charter school. Any and all monitoring requirements performed by the district will be based on the accuracy and completeness of the information as provided to the district.  

James Marta & Company LLP (the charter school’s independent auditor) has expressed its opinion that “the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the Charter, as of June 30, 2023, and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.”  

Education Code 47605(m) requires each charter school to annually provide a copy of its independent financial audit report to the chartering authority, the controller and county superintendent.  

According to the VIE 2022-2023 audit report, ending cash was $63,993,688, total revenues equaled $99,811,643 and total expenditures equaled $99,287,366 for the period ending June 30, 2023. The audit report reflects net assets of $65,651,260 and a net position of $29,036,888.  

VIE reflects an increase in the net pension liability for CalPERS and CalSTRS of $17,390,747 as of June 30, 2023 but had no outstanding required contributions due.  

There were no findings or questioned costs related to the basic financial statements or state awards for the year ended June 30, 2023.

**Board of Directors**  
Visions In Education Charter School  
Carmichael, California  

## Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements

### Opinions

We have audited the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Visions In Education (the “Charter”), as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the Charter’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents.

In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the Charter, as of June 30, 2023, and the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

### Basis for Opinions

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Charter and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.

### Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements

The Charter’s management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Charter’s ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Charter’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.
- Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Charter’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control–related matters that we identified during the audit.

## Required Supplementary Information

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management’s discussion and analysis; statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balance budget (Non-GAAP) and actual - General Fund; schedule of proportionate share of net pension liability; schedule of pension contributions and the Schedule of Changes in the Charter’s Net Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) Liability and Related Ratios on pages 4-8, 39, 40, 41, and 42, respectively, be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

**Supplementary Information**

Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the Charter’s basic financial statements. The supplementary information as listed in the table of contents are presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic financial statements.

The supplementary information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the supplementary information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.

**Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards**

In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated October 9, 2023 on our consideration of Charter’s internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering Charter’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

## MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
### JUNE 30, 2023  

This section of Visions In Education (the “Charter”) 2022-23 annual financial report presents our discussion and analysis of the Charter's financial performance during the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2023. Please read it in conjunction with the Charter's financial statements, which immediately follow this section.

## CHARTER PROFILE  
Visions In Education is a tuition-free public school that supports personalized learning in public education, located in Carmichael, California, in Sacramento County. According to the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau, Carmichael’s population estimate is 79,793. The Charter is very proud to have graduated over 1,100 high school seniors in the fiscal year of 2022-2023. The Charter also continues to maintain strong attendance with students present nearly 95% of school days. Visions In Education is fully accredited by Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and was renewed in 2022.

The Charter comprises three academies servicing TK – 12 grade levels, two high school options, one early college preparatory, one independent study, and one school serving home school students. The school has a homeschool option that serves TK – 12. The Charter currently employs approximately 447 staff members.

## MISSION  
As an independent study/home school program, Visions In Education utilizes a standards-based education that addresses individual differences and learning styles. Visions empowers students to take ownership and responsibility for their present and future learning by developing their academic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and technological skills.

## FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  
Due to the steady enrollment, the Charter’s reserves have remained strong. For Visions, steady enrollment means more reliance on COLA and grant funding. The Charter is committed to fiscal stability.

- General fund ending balance as of June 30, 2023 was $65,651,260.
- The Charter ended the year with a restricted ending fund balance of $9,526,828.
- The General Fund available reserves as a percentage of total outgo (expenditures, other uses, and transfers out) was 18.74%, after accounting for committed balances.
- GASB 68 was implemented five years ago, which required the net pension liability to be recognized. A net pension liability of $49,506,505 was recognized as of June 30, 2023.
- On the Statement of Activities, total current year revenues exceeded total current year expenses by $524,277.

## MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
### JUNE 30, 2023  

## OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

### The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities and Change in Net Position  

The Statement of Net Position and the Statement of Activities report information about the Charter as a whole and about its activities. These statements include all assets and liabilities of the Charter using the accrual basis of accounting, which is similar to the accounting used by most private-sector companies. All of the current year’s revenues and expenses are taken into account regardless of when cash is received or paid.  

These two statements report the Charter’s net position and changes in them. Net position is the difference between assets and liabilities, one way to measure the Charter’s financial health or financial position. Over time, increases or decreases in the Charter’s net position is one indicator of whether its financial health is improving or deteriorating. Other factors to consider are changes in the Charter’s enrollment, property tax base, and the condition of the Charter’s facilities.  

The relationship between revenues and expenses is the Charter’s operating results. Since the Board’s responsibility is to provide services to our students and not to generate profit as commercial entities do, one must consider other factors when evaluating the overall health of the Charter. The quality of the education and the safety of our schools will likely be two important factors.  

### Fund Financial Statements  

The fund financial statements are designed to report information about the Charter’s most significant funds. Funds are accounting devices the Charter uses to keep track of specific sources of funding and spending on particular programs. Some funds are required by State law and by bond covenants. The Charter establishes other funds to control and manage money for particular purposes or to show that it is properly using certain revenues. Fund financial statements focus on individual parts of the Charter, reporting the Charter’s operations in more detail than the Charter-wide statements.  

- **Governmental funds statements** tell how basic services such as instruction and pupil services were financed in the short term as well as what remains for future spending. Most of the Charter’s basic services are included in governmental funds. Because this information does not encompass the additional long-term focus of the government-wide statements, we provide additional information in the reconciliation statements that explains the relationship (or differences) between them.  

- **Proprietary funds statements** offer financial information about the activities the Charter operates on a cost reimbursement basis, such as the self-insurance fund. Proprietary funds are reported in the same way as the government-wide statements. The Charter currently has one internal service fund – the self-insurance fund for dental and vision benefits.

**JUNE 30, 2023**

**GENERAL FUND**

**General Fund Budgetary Highlights**

The Charter’s budget is prepared in accordance with California law and is based on the modified accrual basis of accounting. Over the course of the year, the Charter revises its budget based on updated financial information. The original budget, approved at the end of June for July 1, is based on the Governor's May Revised figures and updated 45 days after the State approves its final budget. In addition, the Charter revises its budget at First and Second Interim and any other time there are significant changes.

Other than the aforementioned instance, the Charter did not incur unanticipated expenditures in excess of appropriations in expenditure classifications for which the budget was not revised.

**ECONOMIC FACTORS AND THE FY 2023-24 BUDGET**

The Governing Board is committed to fiscal stability and fiscal solvency. As we look to the future, we do see a post-covid environment with shifting demands for independent study programs which will enable us to see growth for our Independent Study Academy and a more competitive environment which will put pressure on our ability to maintain current enrollment levels in our Home School Academy. In addition, we expect continued pressure from the legislature as it relates to operating non-classroom programs. However, we continue to remain optimistic in our ability to manage and maintain a sustainable program into the future as the opportunity to serve more students in our Independent Study program appears to offset losses in our Home School Academy.

**CONTACTING THE CHARTER’S FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT**

This financial report is designed to provide our citizens, taxpayers, parents, investors, and creditors with a general overview of the Charter’s finances and to show the Charter’s accountability for the money it receives. If you have questions regarding this report or need additional financial information, contact the Charter Office, Visions In Education, 5030 El Camino Ave, Carmichael, California 95608.

**RECONCILIATION OF THE GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS STATEMENT OF REVENUES, EXPENDITURES, AND CHANGES IN FUND BALANCES TO THE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES**

**FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023**

Total net change in fund balances - governmental funds  $ 18,310,870

Amounts reported for governmental activities in the statement of activities are different from amounts reported in governmental funds because:

Capital outlay: In governmental funds, the costs of capital assets are reported as expenditures in the period when the assets are acquired. In the statement of activities, costs of capital assets are allocated over their estimated useful lives as depreciation expense. The difference between capital outlay expenditures and depreciation expense for the period is:

Expenditures for capital outlay:  $ 67,061  
Depreciation expense:  (77,427)  
(10,366)

Compensated absences: In governmental funds, compensated absences are measured by the amounts paid during the period. In the statement of activities, compensated absences are measure by the amounts earned. The difference between compensated absences paid and compensated absences earned was:  48,017

Other postemployment benefits (OPEB): In government funds, OPEB expenses are recognized when employer OPEB contributions are made. In the statement of activities, OPEB expenses are recognized on the accrual basis. This year, the difference between OPEB expenses and actual employer OPEB contributions was:  201

Pensions: In government funds, pension costs are recognized when employer contributions are made in the statement of activities, pension costs are recognized on the accrual basis. This year, the difference between accrual-basis pension costs and actual employer contributions was:  (17,824,445)

Total change in net position - governmental activities  $ 524,277

## NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
### JUNE 30, 2023

1. **SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

   A. **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**  
   Visions In Education Charter School (the "Charter") accounts for its financial transactions in accordance with the policies and procedures of the California Department of Education's California School Accounting Manual. The accounting policies of the Charter conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. For state entitlement programs, the Charter has elected to match the revenues in the period that program expenditures are made to be consistent with the accounting for grants and other revenues.

   B. **REPORTING ENTITY**  
   The Board of Directors is the level of government which has governance responsibilities over all activities related to public elementary school education in the Charter. The Board is not included in any other governmental "reporting entity" as defined by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, since Board members have decision-making authority, the power to designate management, the responsibility to significantly influence operations and primary accountability for fiscal matters.

   C. **BASIS OF PRESENTATION**  
   **Government-wide Financial Statements**  
   The statement of net position and the statement of activities display information about the Charter. These statements include the financial activities of the overall government, except for fiduciary activities and component units. At June 30, 2023, the Charter School has no component units for financial reporting purposes. Eliminations have been made to minimize the double counting of internal activities.

   The government-wide statement of net position presents information on all of the Charter’s assets and liabilities, with the difference between the two presented as net position. Net position is reported as one of three categories: invested in capital assets, net of related debt; restricted or unrestricted. Restricted net position is further classified as either net position restricted by enabling legislation or net position that is otherwise restricted.

   The government-wide statement of activities presents a comparison between direct expenses and program revenues for each function or program of the Charter’s governmental activities. Direct expenses are those that are specifically associated with a service, program, or department and are, therefore, clearly identifiable to a particular function. The Charter does not allocate indirect expenses to functions in the statement of activities. Program revenues include charges paid by the recipients of goods or services offered by a program, as well as grants and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular program. Revenues, which are not classified as program revenues, are presented as general revenues of the Charter, with certain exceptions. The comparison of direct expenses with program revenues identifies the

## NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
### JUNE 30, 2023

1. **SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

   extent to which each governmental function is self-financing or draws from the general revenues of the Charter.

   The Charter reports all direct expenses by function in the Statement of Activities. Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a function. Depreciation expense is specifically identified by function and is included in the direct expense function. Interest on long-term liabilities is considered an indirect expense and is reported separately in the Statement of Activities.

   **Fund Financial Statements**

   Fund financial statements report detailed information about the Charter. The focus of governmental fund financial statements is on major funds rather than reporting funds by type. Each major governmental fund is presented in a separate column, and all non-major funds are aggregated into one column.

D. **MEASUREMENT FOCUS AND BASIS OF ACCOUNTING**

   **Government-wide Financial Statements**

   The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied. Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements are met. Expenses are recorded when liabilities are incurred.

   **Governmental Fund Financial Statements**

   Governmental fund financial statements (i.e., balance sheet and statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances) are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Revenue resulting from exchange transactions, in which each party gives and receives essentially equal value, is recorded under the accrual basis when the exchange takes place. On a modified accrual basis, revenue is recorded in the fiscal year in which the resources are measurable and become available. “Available” means the resources will be collected within the current fiscal year or are expected to be collected soon enough thereafter to be used to pay liabilities of the current fiscal year. For the Charter, “available” means collectible within the current period or within 60 days after year-end.

   Non-exchange transactions, in which the Charter receives value without directly giving equal value in return, include property taxes, grants, and entitlements. Under the accrual basis, revenue from property taxes is recognized in the fiscal year for which the taxes are levied. Revenue from grants and entitlements is recognized in the fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements have been satisfied. Eligibility requirements include timing requirements, which specify the year when the resources are to be used, or the fiscal year when use is first permitted; matching requirements, in

   which the Charter must provide local resources to be used for a specified purpose; and expenditure requirements, in which the resources are provided to the Charter on a reimbursement basis. Under the modified accrual basis, revenue from non-exchange transactions must also be available before it can be recognized.

   Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expenditures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due.

E. **FUND ACCOUNTING**

   The accounts of the Charter are organized on the basis of funds or account groups, each of which is considered to be a separate accounting entity. The operations of each fund are accounted for with a separate set of self-balancing accounts that comprise its assets, liabilities, fund equity, revenues, and expenditures or expenses, as appropriate. Charter resources are allocated to and accounted for in individual funds based upon the purpose for which they are to be spent and the means by which spending activities are controlled. The Charter funds and account groups are as follows:

   **Governmental Funds:**

   - **General Fund** is the general operating fund of the Charter. It is used to account for all transactions except those required or permitted by law to be accounted for in another fund.

   - **Special Revenue Funds** are used to account for the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are legally restricted to expenditures for specific purposes. The Charter has no special revenue funds.

   - **Capital Projects Funds** are used to account for the acquisition and/or construction of all major governmental general fixed assets. The Charter has no capital projects funds.

F. **BUDGETS AND BUDGETARY ACCOUNTING**

   Annual budgets are adopted on a basis consistent with generally accepted accounting principles for all governmental funds. By state law, the Charter's Board of Directors must adopt a final budget no later than July 1. A public hearing must be conducted to receive comments prior to adoption. The Charter's Board of Directors satisfied these requirements.

   The Charter employs budgetary control by major object code and by individual appropriation accounts. Expenditures cannot legally exceed appropriations by major object code. The budgets are revised during the year by the Board of Directors to provide for unanticipated revenues and expenditures. The originally adopted and final revised budget for the General Fund is presented as Required Supplementary Information.

### JUNE 30, 2023

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

**G. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE**  
Receivables are made up principally of amounts due from the State of California. The Charter School has determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts was needed as of June 30, 2023.

**H. CAPITAL ASSETS**  
Capital assets are those purchased or acquired with an original cost of $15,000 or more and are reported at historical cost or estimated historical cost. Contributed assets are reported at fair market value as of the date received. Additions, improvements, and other capital outlays that significantly extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value of the assets or materially extend the asset’s lives are not capitalized, but are expensed as incurred. Depreciation on all capital assets is computed using the straight-line basis over 4 - 30 years depending on asset types.

**I. COMPENSATED ABSENCES**  
All vacation pay plus related payroll taxes are accrued when incurred in the government-wide financial statements. A liability for these amounts is reported in the governmental funds only if they have matured, for example, as a result of employee resignations and retirements.

**J. ACCUMULATED SICK LEAVE**  
Sick leave benefits are not recognized as liabilities of the Charter. The Charter's policy is to record sick leave as an operating expenditure in the period taken since such benefits do not vest nor is payment probable; however, unused sick leave is added to the creditable service period for calculation of retirement benefits when the employee retires.

**K. RESTRICTED NET POSITION**  
Restrictions of the ending net position indicate the portions of net position not appropriate for expenditure or amounts legally segregated for specific future use. These amounts are not available for appropriation and expenditure at the balance sheet date.  
When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the Charter’s policy to use restricted resources first, then, unrestricted resources as they are needed.

**L. FINANCING LEASES**  
A lease is defined as a contract that conveys control of the right to use another entity’s nonfinancial asset as specified in the contract for a period of time in an exchange or exchange-like transaction. The long-term liability and corresponding asset for financial leases are recorded in the financial statements to the extent that the Charter’s lease capitalization threshold is met, $500,000. Amortization of related assets using the straight-line method over the life of the contract. As of June 30, 2023, the Charter did not have any financial leases that met the threshold.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

**M. UNEARNED REVENUE**  
Cash received for federal and state special projects and programs is recognized as revenue to the extent that the qualified expenditures have been incurred. Unearned revenue is recorded to the extent cash received on specific projects and programs exceed qualified expenditures.

**N. PREPAID EXPENSES**  
Any future expenses that are paid for ahead of the fiscal year end are recorded as prepaid expenses. These expenses consist of prepayments of credit cards and insurance costs.

**O. PROPERTY TAX**  
The Charter’s revenue limit is received from a combination of local property taxes, state apportionments, and other local sources.  

Secured property taxes are levied as an enforceable lien on property as of March 1. Taxes are payable in two installments, on December 10 and April 10. Unsecured property taxes are payable in one installment on or before August 31. The County of Sacramento bills and collects the taxes for the Charter. Tax revenues are recognized by the Charter when received.

**P. ENCUMBRANCES**  
Encumbrance accounting is used in all budgeted funds to reserve portions of applicable appropriations for which commitments have been made. Encumbrances are recorded for purchase orders, contracts, and other commitments when they are written. Encumbrances are liquidated when the commitments are paid. All encumbrances are liquidated at June 30.

**Q. ESTIMATES**  
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

**R. ELIMINATIONS AND RECLASSIFICATIONS**  
In the process of aggregating data for the government-wide statements, some amounts reported as interfund activity and balances in the fund financial statements were eliminated or reclassified. Interfund receivables and payables were eliminated to minimize the “grossing up” effect on assets and liabilities within the governmental activities column.

1. **SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)**

   **S. PENSIONS**

   For purposes of measuring the net pension liability and deferred outflows/inflows of resources related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the Charter School’s California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) and California State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) plans (Plans) and additions to/deductions from the Plans’ fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by CalPERS and STRS, respectively. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value.

   **T. FUND BALANCE**

   In accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 54, "Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions", the Charter is required to report fund balances in the following categories: Nonspendable, Restricted, Committed, Assigned and/or Unassigned.

   - **Nonspendable Fund Balance** reflects assets not in spendable form, either because they will never convert to cash (e.g. prepaid expense) or must remain intact pursuant to legal or contractual requirements.

   - **Restricted Fund Balance** reflects amounts that can be spent only for the specific purposes stipulated by constitution, external resource providers, or through enabling legislation.

   - **Committed Fund Balance** reflects amounts that can be used only for the specific purposes determined by a formal action of the government's highest level of decision-making authority: the Board of Directors. Commitments may be established, modified, or rescinded only through resolutions approved by the Board of Directors.

   - **Assigned Fund Balance** reflects amounts intended to be used by the government for specific purposes but do not meet the criteria to be classified as restricted or committed. Under the Charter’s adopted policy, only the Board of Directors is authorized to assign amounts for specific purposes.

   - **Unassigned Fund Balance** represents the residual classification for the government's general fund and includes all spendable amounts not contained in the other classifications.

   When expenditures are incurred for purposes of which restricted, committed, assigned and unassigned fund balances are available, the Charter considers restricted funds to have been spent first, followed by committed, assigned and unassigned, respectively.

   **U. POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS (OPEB)**  
   For purposes of measuring the Charter School’s OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources, information about the fiduciary net position of the Charter’s OPEB Plan (Plan) and additions to/deductions from the Plan’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the Plan. For this purpose, the Plan recognizes benefit payments when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value, except for money market investments and participating interest earning investment contracts that have a maturity at the time of purchase of one year or less, which are reported at cost.

   **V. DEFERRED INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS**  
   In addition to assets, the statement of net position includes a separate section for deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of net position that applies to a future period(s), and as such will not be recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditures) until then.

   In addition, the statement of net position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s) and as such, will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time.

   **W. SUBSCRIPTION BASED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENTS (SBITA)**  
   A SBITA is defined as a contract that conveys control of the right to use another party’s (a SBITA vendor’s) IT software, alone or in combination with tangible capital assets (the underlying IT assets) as specified in the contract for a period of time in an exchange or exchange-like transaction. The long-term liability and corresponding asset for SBITAs are recorded in the financial statements to the extent that the Charter’s capitalization threshold is met, $250,000. Amortization of related assets using the straight-line method over the life of the contract. As of June 30, 2023, the Charter did not have any financial leases that met the threshold.

### 2. CASH AND INVESTMENTS

Cash and investments as of June 30, 2023 consist of the following:

| Governmental Activities      |        |
|------------------------------|--------|
| Cash in County Treasury       | $61,943,188 |
| Cash in revolving fund        | $2,050,500  |
| **Total cash held**          | **$63,993,688** |

#### A. Cash in County Treasury

**Pooled Funds**

In accordance with Education Code Section 41001, the Charter maintains substantially all of its cash in the interest-bearing Sacramento County Treasurer’s Pooled Investment Fund. The Charter is considered to be an involuntary participant in an external investment pool. The fair value of the Charter School’s investment in the pool is reported in the financial statements at amounts based upon the Charter School’s pro-rata share of the fair value provided by the County Treasurer for the entire portfolio (in relation to the amortized cost of that portfolio). The weighted average maturity of the pool is 267 days. The pool is rated AAA by Standard and Poor’s. The balance available for withdrawal is based on the accounting records maintained by the County Treasurer, which is recorded on the amortized cost basis.

**Interest Rate Risk**

The Charter does not have a formal investment policy that limits cash and investment maturities as a means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates. At June 30, 2023, the Charter had no significant interest rate risk related to cash and investments held.

**Credit Risk**

The Charter does not have a formal investment policy that limits its investment choices other than the limitations of state law.

**Concentration of Credit Risk**

The Charter does not place limits on the amount it may invest in any one issuer. At June 30, 2023, the Charter had no concentration of credit risk.

**Contributions**

**CalPERS**

Section 20814(c) of the California Public Employees’ Retirement Law requires that the employer contribution rates for all public employers be determined on an annual basis by the actuary and shall be effective on the July 1 following notice of a change in the rate. Funding contributions for the Plan are determined annually on an actuarial basis as of June 30 by CalPERS. The actuarially determined rate is the estimated amount necessary to finance the costs of benefits earned by employees during the year, with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued liability. The Charter is required to contribute the difference between the actuarially determined rate and the contribution rate of employees.

**STRS**

Required member, employer and state contribution rates are set by the California Legislature and Governor and detailed in Teachers’ Retirement Law. Contribution rates are expressed as a level percentage of payroll using the entry age normal actuarial cost method.

For the year ended June 30, 2023, the contributions reported as deferred outflows of resources related to pensions recognized as part of pension expense for each Plan were as follows:

The Charter’s net pension liability for each Plan is measured as the proportionate share of the net pension liability. The net pension liability of each of the Plans is measured as of June 30, 2022, and the total pension liability for each Plan used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 2021 rolled forward to June 30, 2022 using standard update procedures. The Charter’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on a projection of the Charter’s long-term share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the projected contributions of all participating employers, actuarially determined. The Charter’s proportionate share of the net pension liability for the Plan as of June 30, 2021 and 2022 was as follows:

| Measurement Dates | Fiscal Year | CalPERS | STRS |

## NOTES TO THE BASIC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
### JUNE 30, 2023

### 6. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT SYSTEMS (CONTINUED)

The mortality table used was developed based on CalPERS-specific data. The rates incorporate Generational Mortality to capture ongoing morality improvement using 80% of Scale MP 2020 published by the Society of Actuaries. For more details, please refer to the 2021 experience study report that can be found on the CalPERS website.

STRS changed the mortality assumptions based on the July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2018, experience study adopted by the board in January 2020. STRS uses a generational mortality assumption, which involves the use of a base mortality table and projection scales to reflect expected annual reductions in mortality rates at each age, resulting in increases in life expectancies each year into the future. The base mortality tables are CalSTRS custom tables derived to best fit the patterns of mortality among members. The projection scale was set equal to 110% of the ultimate improvement factor from the Mortality Improvement Scale (MP–2019) table issued by the Society of Actuaries.

### Discount Rate

#### CalPERS

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability for the Plan was 6.90%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from Plan members will be made at the current member contribution rates and that contributions from employers will be made at statutorily required rates, actuarially determined. Based on those assumptions, the Plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. These discount rates are equal to the long-term expected rate of return of the respective plan assets and are net of investment expense but not reduced for administrative expenses.

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class.

In determining the long-term expected rate of return, CalPERS took into account long-term market return expectations as well as the expected pension fund cash flows. Projected returns for all asset classes are estimated and, combined with risk estimates, are used to project compound (geometric) returns over the long term. The discount rate used to discount liabilities was informed by the long-term projected portfolio return. The expected rate of return was then set equal to the single equivalent rate calculated above and adjusted to account for assumed administrative expenses.

The expected real rates of return by asset class are on the following table:

### Discount Rate  
#### STRS  
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.10%, which was unchanged from prior fiscal year. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from plan members and employers are made at statutory contribution rates in accordance with the rate increases actuarially determined. Projected inflows from investment earnings were calculated using the long-term assumed investment rate of return of 7.10% and assume that contributions, benefit payments and administrative expenses occur midyear. Based on those assumptions, the Plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments to current plan members. Therefore, the long-term assumed investment rate of return was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.

The long-term investment rate of return assumption was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. The best-estimate ranges were developed using capital market assumptions from STRS investment staff and investment consultants as inputs to the process.

The actuarial investment rate of return assumption was adopted by the board in January 2020 in conjunction with the most recent experience study. For each current and future valuation, STRS’ independent consulting actuary (Milliman) reviews the return assumption for reasonableness based on the most current capital market assumptions. Best estimates of expected 20-year geometrically linked real rates of return and the assumed asset allocation for each major asset class as of the June 30, 2022 measurement date, are summarized in the following table:

**General Information about the OPEB Plan**

**Plan description:**  
The Charter’s defined benefit Other Post Employment Benefit Program (the Plan), provides post-employment health care benefits (medical and dental) under a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan to management who are eligible to retire from the Charter School and have completed a minimum of 5 years of employment with the Charter School. The plan does not issue separate financial statements. Health care benefits are provided for management employees who are eligible to retire under a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan, and have completed a minimum of 5 years of employment with the Charter School and are at least 55 and has not yet reached 65. Health care benefits are provided to these employees until they have attained the age of 65. As of June 30, 2023, the Charter has not accumulated assets in a qualified trust for the purpose of paying the benefits related to the Charter School’s total OPEB liability.

**Employees Covered by Benefit Terms:**  
For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, the Charter had 16 active employees and 0 retired employees receiving benefits.

**Benefits Provided:**  
The benefits provided are the same as those provided for active employees. Spouses and dependents of eligible retirees are not eligible for coverage. Only management employees of the Charter in a management position prior to July 1, 2018 and who remain continuously employed in a management position prior to retirement are eligible to receive postemployment health care benefits. No other employees are not eligible to receive postemployment health care benefits.

**Contributions:**  
California Government Code specifies that the Charter School’s contribution requirements for covered employees are established and may be amended by the Board of Directors. Retirees participating in the group insurance plans offered by the Charter have 100% of the active premiums paid for by the Charter. In future years, contributions are assumed to increase at the same rate as premiums. The Charter’s premium rates being charged to these retirees are lower than the expected cost for a retiree population under age 65.

**Discount Rate:**  
The discount rate used to measure the total OPEB liability was 4.09 percent as of June 30, 2022 measurement date. The rate increased from 2.18 percent; the rate used as of June 30, 2021 measurement date. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that contributions from school districts will be made at rates equal to the actuarially determined contribution rates. Based on those assumptions, the OPEB plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected OPEB payments for current active and inactive employees. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total OPEB liability.

**Sensitivity of the net OPEB liability to changes in the discount rate and healthcare cost trend rates:**  
The following presents the net OPEB liability of the Charter, as well as what the Charter’s net OPEB liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point lower (3.09 percent) or 1-percentage-point higher (5.09 percent) than the current discount rate:

10. **COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**  
The Charter is subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect the financial position or results of operations of the Charter.

Also, the Charter has received federal and state funds for specific purposes that are subject to review or audit by the grantor agencies. Although such audits could generate expenditure disallowances under terms of the grants, it is believed that any required reimbursements will not be material.

(1) Historical information is required only for measurement periods for which GASB 68 is applicable.  
(2) Employers are assumed to make contributions equal to the contractually required contributions. However, some employers may choose to make additional contributions towards their sick fund or their unfunded liability. Employer contributions for such plans exceed the contractually required contributions. CalPERS has determined that employer obligations referred to as "side funds" do not conform to the circumstances described in paragraph 120 of GASB 68, therefore are not considered separately financed specific liabilities.  
(3) Covered payroll is the payroll on which contributions to a pension plan are based.

1. **PURPOSE OF SCHEDULES**

   A - **Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balance – Budget (Non-GAAP) and Actual – General Fund**

   The Charter employs budget control by object codes and by individual appropriation accounts. Budgets are prepared on the modified accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. The budgets are revised during the year by the Board of Directors to provide for revised priorities. Expenditures cannot legally exceed appropriations by major object code. The originally adopted and final revised budgets for the General Fund are presented as Required Supplementary Information.

   B - **Schedule of Changes in the Charter’s Net OPEB Liability and Related Ratios**

   Benefit changes: There were no changes to benefits.

   Changes of assumptions: The discount rate increased from 2.18% as of June 30, 2021 to 4.09% as of June 30, 2022.

   Fiscal year 2018 was the first year of implementation, therefore only six years are shown. The schedule below summarizes the estimates used by the actuary of OPEB.

   | Funding method                | Entry Age Normal Cost                     |
   |-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
   | Amortization method           | Level percentage of pay                   |
   | Asset valuation method         | Market value of assets                    |
   | Municipal bond index          | S&P General Obligation Municipal Bond 20 Year High Grade Index |
   | General inflation rate        | 2.50% per year                           |
   | Healthcare cost trend rate    | 6.8% and fluctuate down to 3.9% for years 2076 and later |
   | Salary increases              | 3.00% per year; since benefits do not depend on salary, this is used only to allocate the actuarial cost of benefits between service years |
   | Investment rate of return     | 4.09%                                     |

## NOTES TO REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

1. **PURPOSE OF SCHEDULES (CONTINUED)**

   C - **Schedule of Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability**

   This schedule presents information on the Charter School's proportionate share of the net pension liability (NPL), the Plans' fiduciary net position and, when applicable, the State's proportionate share of the NPL associated with the Charter School. Fiscal year 2015 was the first year of implementation, therefore only nine years are shown. In the future, as data becomes available, ten years of information will be presented.

   **Changes of Assumptions**  
   The discount rate changed for CalPERS from 7.15% to 6.90%. The inflation rate for CalPERS changed from 2.50% to 2.30%. The payroll growth rate for CalPERS changed from 2.75% to 2.80%. There were no changes in assumptions for CalSTRS.

   **Changes in Benefit Terms**  
   There were no changes in benefit terms since the previous valuations for both CalPERS and CalSTRS.

   D - **Schedule of Pension Contributions**

   If an employer's contributions to the plan are actuarially determined or based on statutory or contractual requirements, the employer's actuarially determined contribution to the pension plan (or, if applicable, its statutorily or contractually required contribution), the employer's actual contributions, the difference between the actual and actuarially determined contributions (or statutorily or contractually required), and a ratio of the actual contributions divided by covered employee payroll. Fiscal year 2015 was the first year of implementation, therefore only nine years are shown. In the future, as data becomes available, ten years of information will be presented.

## NOTES TO SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

### FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2023

1. **PURPOSE OF STATEMENTS AND SCHEDULES**

   A. **Schedule of Average Daily Attendance**  
   Average daily attendance is a measurement of the number of pupils attending classes of the Charter. The purpose of attendance accounting from a fiscal standpoint is to provide the basis on which apportionments of state funds are made to charter schools. This schedule provides information regarding the attendance of students at various grade levels and in different programs.

   B. **Schedule of Instructional Time**  
   This schedule presents information on the amount of instructional time offered by the Charter and whether the Charter complied with the provisions of Education Code Sections 46200 through 46206. Charters must maintain their instructional minutes in accordance with the State’s standard requirement as required by Education Code Section 46201(b).

   C. **Schedule of Charter Schools**  
   This schedule provides information for the California Department of Education to monitor financial reporting by Charter Schools.

   D. **Reconciliation of Annual Financial and Budget Report with Audited Financial Statements**  
   This schedule provides the information necessary to reconcile the fund balances of all funds, as reported in the Annual Financial and Budget Report to the audited financial statements.

   E. **Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards**  
   The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards includes federal grant activity of the Charter and is presented under the modified accrual basis of accounting. The May 2023 Edition of the Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements of Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) requires a disclosure of the financial activities of all federally funded programs. This schedule was prepared to comply with Uniform Guidance and state requirements. Therefore, some amounts presented in this schedule may differ from amounts used in the preparation of the general purpose financial statements. The Charter has elected not to use the 10-percent de minimis indirect cost rate allowed under the Uniform Guidance.

   F. **Schedule of Financial Trends and Analysis**  
   This schedule discloses the Charter's financial trends by displaying past years' data along with current year budget information. These financial trend disclosures are used to evaluate the Charter's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

# INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT ON STATE COMPLIANCE

Board of Directors  
Visions In Education  
Carmichael, California  

## Report on Compliance

### Opinion

We have audited the Visions In Education (the “Charter”) compliance with the requirements specified in the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting applicable to the Charter’s state program requirements identified below for the year ended June 30, 2023.

In our opinion, Visions In Education complied, in all material respects, with the laws and regulations of the state programs noted in the table below for the year ended June 30, 2023.

### Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS), the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.

We are required to be independent of the Charter and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the Charter’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.

### Responsibilities of Management for Compliance

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the Charter’s state programs.

### Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the Charter’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting will always detect a material noncompliance when it exists.

<!-- Page 447 -->
The risk of not detecting a material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the Charter’s compliance with the requirements of the state programs as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, we:

- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit;
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the Charter’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances;
- Obtain an understanding of the Charter’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Charter’s internal controls over compliance. Accordingly, we express no such opinion; and
- Select and test transactions and records to determine the Charter’s compliance with the state laws and regulations applicable to the following items:

We did not perform procedures related to California Clean Energy Jobs Act as the Charter submitted their final report in fiscal year 2020-21.

We did not perform any procedures related to After/Before School Education and Safety Program and Independent Study-Course Based because they were not offered in the current year.

We did not perform any procedures related to Annual Instructional Minutes – Classroom Based and Mode of Instruction because the Charter is nonclassroom based.  
We did not perform any procedures related to Immunization as none of the Charter’s schools appeared on the lists of schools that did not submit immunization assessment reports to the California Department of Public Health or those that reported combined conditional admission and overdue rates greater than 10 percent in kindergarten and in 7th grade.

We did not perform any procedures related to Charter School Facility Grant Program because the Charter did not receive any funding from this program.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identify during the audit.

**Report on Internal Control over Compliance**

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material noncompliance with a compliance requirement will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention from those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit, we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified.

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the 2022-23 Guide for Annual Audits of K-12 Local Education Agencies and State Compliance Reporting. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

# REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND ON COMPLIANCE AND OTHER MATTERS BASED ON AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT

**Board of Directors**  
Visions In Education Charter School  
Carmichael, California  

We have audited, in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, the financial statements of the governmental activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of Visions In Education Charter School as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise Visions In Education Charter School’s basic financial statements, and have issued our report thereon dated October 9, 2023.

### Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements, we considered Visions in Education Charter School’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Visions In Education’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of Visions In Education’s internal control.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. However, material weaknesses may exist that have not been identified.

**Compliance and Other Matters**

As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Visions In Education Charter School’s financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit, and accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards.

**Purpose of this Report**

The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the result of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control or on compliance. This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity’s internal control and compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable for any other purpose.

## REPORT ON COMPLIANCE FOR EACH MAJOR FEDERAL PROGRAM; REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER COMPLIANCE; AND REPORT ON SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS REQUIRED BY THE UNIFORM GUIDANCE  

### INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  

**Board of Trustees**  
Visions In Education  
Carmichael, California  

### Report on Compliance for Each Major Federal Program  

**Opinion on Each Major Federal Program**  

We have audited Visions In Education’s (the “Charter”) compliance with the types of compliance requirements identified as subject to audit in the May 2023 Edition of the OMB Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the Charter’s major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2023. The Charter’s major federal programs are identified in the summary of auditor’s results section of the accompanying schedule of findings and questioned costs.  

In our opinion, the Charter complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to above that could have a direct and material effect on each of its major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2023.  

### Basis for Opinion on Each Major Federal Program  

We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS); the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States (Government Auditing Standards); and the audit requirements of the May 2023 Edition of the Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Our responsibilities under those standards and the Uniform Guidance are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report.  

We are required to be independent of the Charter and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on compliance for each major federal program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the Charter’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above.  

### Responsibilities of Management for Compliance  

Management is responsible for compliance with the requirements referred to above and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rules and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the Charter’s federal programs.

# Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the Charter’s compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance will always detect material noncompliance when it exists. The risk of not detecting material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than that resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the Charter’s compliance with the requirements of each major federal program as a whole.

In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards, and the Uniform Guidance, we:
- Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
- Identify and assess the risks of material noncompliance, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the Charter’s compliance with the compliance requirements referred to above and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
- Obtain an understanding of the Charter’s internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with the Uniform Guidance, but for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Charter’s internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit.

## Report on Internal Control Over Compliance

A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal control over compliance, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section above and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be material weaknesses, as defined above. However, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance may exist that were not identified.

Our audit was not designed for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of the Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose.

**Report on Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by the Uniform Guidance**

We have audited the financial statements of Visions In Education as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, and have issued our report thereon dated October 9, 2023, which contained an unmodified opinion on those financial statements. Our audit was performed for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The accompanying schedule of expenditures of federal awards is presented for purposes of additional analysis as required by the Uniform Guidance and is not a required part of the financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the financial statements or to the financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federal awards is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the financial statements as a whole.

Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board approve the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) and corresponding budget.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
San Juan Unified School District schools annually review and revise their school plans based on current data analysis and the latest research using a collaborative process involving members of the school community. Division of Teaching and Learning staff have worked with site leaders to ensure that their plans include a comprehensive needs assessment, input from educational partners and the identification of resource inequities. The SPSA outlines specific strategies for improving student outcomes through goals and actions that are aligned to the district’s Strategic Plan and the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) and comply with federal program regulations. The SPSA provides site leaders and educational partners with the opportunity to collaborate around goals and actions to mitigate resource inequities and promote equitable student outcomes. The SPSA is an additional tool to advance our focus on strategic results.

Pending board approval, plans will be translated and posted on both the district and school websites to enhance communication and transparency for parents and community members.

BOARD OF EDUCATION  

AGENDA ITEM: G.17  
MEETING DATE: 06/25/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Resolution to Ratify the Award of Master Agreements for Construction Management and Program Management Services and Rates  

**DEPARTMENT:** Operations  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt Resolution No. 4143, ratifying the award of master agreements for construction management and program management service rates.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
On or about March 12, 2021, the district issued a request for proposals (RFP) No. 21-125 for the award of master agreements for construction management (CM) and program management (PM) services. The district issued the RFP to conduct a competitive and transparent process to select a pool of CM and PM firms.  

Staff inadvertently did not submit the master agreement for the district’s board for approval, although each service order issued thereunder has been presented to and approved by the board. Each CM and PM firm that has been awarded a service order under a master agreement has affirmed in writing that it understands that it is bound, and has been bound, by the terms of the master agreement through the period of performance for any service order issued thereunder.  

Given the dramatic increases in the cost of living and inflation, the district approved reasonable rate increases for the 2022-23 fiscal year for CM firms requesting such rate increases, which was within the authority delegated to the district’s Chief Operations Officer under resolution number 4115. The district has not approved rate increases for 2023-24, and no rate increase caused any CM or PM service order to exceed the amount authorized by the board. The district wants to affirm the validity of the CM and PM master agreements under which the board issued service orders and to ratify the rate increase agreed upon between the firms and the district.

SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
AGENDA ITEM: I.1  
BOARD OF EDUCATION  

MEETING DATE: 06/25/2024  

SUBJECT: California School Dashboard: Local Indicators (Slavensky) – 7:25 p.m.  

DEPARTMENT: Teaching and Learning  

ACTION REQUESTED:  
Report regarding the Local Education Agency’s (LEA) measurement of progress for the local indicators related to the state accountability dashboard.  

RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:  
In 2013, California adopted the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and initiated the development of district Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAP). This laid the groundwork for the state accountability system that reports district performance in each of the eight state priority areas using both state and local indicators. State indicators are based on data that is collected consistently across the state and are aligned to state priority areas 4, 5, 6 and 8. Local indicators are based on data collected at the local level and are aligned to state priority areas 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7. Using the California adopted self-reflection tool, districts annually measure progress for each local indicator, report results to the local governing board as part of a non-consent item at the same public meeting in which the LCAP is adopted, and report results to the public through the state’s accountability Dashboard. Local indicator results will be presented for priority 1 (basic services), priority 2 (state standards), priority 3 (parent engagement), priority 6 (school climate), and priority 7 (broad course of study).

The performance standards for the local performance indicators are:

### Appropriately Assigned Teachers, Access to Curriculum-Aligned Instructional Materials, and Safe, Clean and Functional School Facilities (LCFF Priority 1)

The LEA annually measures its progress in meeting the Williams settlement requirements at 100% of all its school sites, as applicable, and promptly addresses any complaints or other deficiencies identified throughout the academic year, as applicable; the LEA then reports the results to its local governing board at a regularly scheduled meeting and to reports to educational partners and the public through the Dashboard.

### Implementation of State Academic Standards (LCFF Priority 2)

The LEA annually measures its progress implementing state academic standards; the LEA then reports the results to its local governing board at a regularly scheduled meeting and reports to educational partners and the public through the Dashboard.

### Parent and Family Engagement (LCFF Priority 3)

This measure addresses Parent and Family Engagement, including how an LEA builds relationships between school staff and families, builds partnerships for student outcomes and seeks input for decision-making.

LEAs report progress of how they have sought input from parents in decision-making and promoted parent participation in programs to its local governing board or body using the SBE-adopted self-reflection tool for Priority 3 at the same meeting at which the LEA adopts its LCAP, and reports to educational partners and the public through the Dashboard.

### School Climate (LCFF Priority 6)

The LEA administers a local climate survey at least every other year that provides a valid measure of perceptions of school safety and connectedness, such as the California Healthy Kids Survey, to students in at least one grade within the grade span(s) that the LEA serves (e.g., K-5, 6-8, 9-12), and reports the results to its local governing board at a regularly scheduled meeting of the local governing board and to educational partners and the public through the Dashboard.

**Building Relationships Dashboard Narrative Boxes (Limited to 3,000 characters)**

1. Based on the analysis of educational partner input and local data, briefly describe the LEA's current strengths and progress in Building Relationships Between School Staff and Families.

San Juan’s Family and Community Engagement (FACE) team works with schools, departments, and community partners to provide multiple ways for families to engage by offering a variety of family engagement opportunities. These opportunities include an increase in family education workshops, two family conferences, community outreach events, and staff professional development focused on supporting the whole child and a wide range of topics that include academic and social-emotional support as well as family enrichment opportunities.

Some of the specific initiatives include a Family Leadership Camp, two Families Matter conferences, and FACE Mobile outreach events. Virtual, in-person, and hybrid options were created for all workshops so that families can participate and learn together. San Juan Unified also increased the number of virtual and in-person professional development opportunities focused on creating a welcoming school environment, strengthening the school-home partnership, and partnering with families as an asset to support student achievement. This year, we launched Parent Teacher Home Visit Project training for any staff who was interested in becoming trained in this highly-effective family engagement strategy. Furthermore, the implementation of the Talking Points two way communication platform has been an excellent tool for school staff and families to communicate effectively and support a partnership between school and home. Through the use of Talking Points, staff can better communicate with families through text messaging and class announcements, which serves as a valuable way to update families on their student’s progress and invite communication, even in different home languages.

Another strength this year has been the continuation of the Neighborhood Learning Project to schools, which brings school and district staff, local community partners, district departments, academic and social-emotional resources to students and families. This partnership, across departments and with community agencies, has helped San Juan continue to strengthen the support provided to schools and families in order to improve student outcomes.

One of our greatest accomplishments in the area of Building Relationships Between School Staff and Families has been this first full year of implementation of our FACE Mobile, a mobile family resource center on wheels that travels to all schools and helps connect families to their school, district departments, and community resources. By partnering with schools and community partners, we’ve been able to effectively help build and rebuild relationships between families and staff, while also building the capacity of school staff to help become more knowledgeable and aware of ways to provide support for families.

2. Based on the analysis of educational partner input and local data, briefly describe the LEA’s focus area(s) for improvement in Building Relationships Between School Staff and Families.

San Juan Unified’s key areas of improvement in Building Relationships Between School Staff and Families consist of continuing to offer staff development opportunities that assist in building capacity of staff to create a welcoming school environment and creating ways for family and student voices to be elevated. Offering a variety of professional development workshops to various staff roles such as classified support staff, front office staff, administrators, certificated staff, and new teachers will serve as a support for staff to gain knowledge and critical tools to help create a strong foundation in the school-home partnership, which will positively impact the building of relationships between school staff and families.

Additionally, during our FACE Mobile visits, we work closely with schools to involve them in the visit, learn about ways to support families with community and district resources, and help them to proactively build relationships with their families. This includes having them identify and personally invite specific families who may need additional support to the FACE Mobile visit. One specific area of focus that we are planning to improve upon is partnering with schools to build their site team’s capacity to create, plan, and implement site based family education and outreach opportunities. By helping build the capacity of staff and connecting families with specific staff from the school, bridges are being built between the school, home, and community which positively support our students and help continue to build relationships.

3. Based on the analysis of educational partner input and local data, briefly describe how the LEA will improve engagement of underrepresented families identified during the self-reflection process in relation to Building Relationships Between School Staff and Families.

Identifying barriers and creating opportunities for increased access to supports and resources is key to improving the engagement of underrepresented families. One idea to guide this work is to continue providing ways for families to receive school and district information in their native language, provide opportunities for families to have two way communication with their child’s school staff, and support school sites in creating ways to invite families of diverse backgrounds on campus for events, volunteer opportunities, or participating in school meetings. Additionally, continuing to work with local community partners and organizations allows us to create an environment that is culturally responsive and welcoming for underrepresented students and families.

**Building Partnerships Dashboard Narrative Boxes (Limited to 3,000 characters)**

1. Based on the analysis of educational partner input and local data, briefly describe the LEA’s current strengths and progress in Building Partnerships for Student Outcomes.

San Juan Unified family engagement efforts strongly support an authentic partnership between school, home, and community. Our district provides many opportunities for families, schools, district departments, and the community to build collaborative and trusting relationships in order to support student success. San Juan’s Family and Community Engagement (FACE) department offers family engagement workshops and educational classes every month to help families and staff build their skills and knowledge around effective school-home partnerships and best practices to support students. Topics include, but are not limited to: understanding the U.S. school system, effective two-way communication, cultural diversity and responsiveness, college-career readiness, positive behavior supports for home and school, social-emotional health and wellness, and academic learning resources. These workshops are offered both in-person and on Zoom so that families can choose what is safe and accessible for them and are presented in a variety of languages, days, and times to support the varying schedules of families. This year, we launched a “graduate” cohort of Family Leadership Academy, one of our series workshops focused on helping parents/guardians learn about the school system and build their leadership skills as partners in education. This graduate cohort then had the opportunity to dive deeper into their leadership and advocacy by partnering with their school sites, district departments, and community organizations to help improve their schools and their partnership. Another strength of the work to build partnerships for student outcomes is the implementation of two Families Matter conferences, which is an opportunity for families to participate in informative workshops, explore district and community resources, and learn ways in which they can be an involved partner in supporting positive student outcomes.

Similarly, professional development opportunities are offered to district staff to help support progress in this area. Some of the professional development workshop topics that are available for staff include creating a welcoming school environment, engaging diverse populations, asset-mapping community resources, creating and maintaining partnerships with community based organizations, and ways to implement high impact family engagement events. Through these monthly professional development opportunities, staff in the district are able to build their knowledge and learn strategies to strengthen partnerships to support student outcomes. Additionally, staff members are also offered the opportunity to be part of ongoing staff book clubs for professional development options that focus on problem resolution, effective communication, and best practices for family engagement.

This year, our FACE team partnered with two pilot schools, Sierra Oaks K-8 and San Juan High School, to help co-create and facilitate a strong model of best Family Engagement practices. This included a needs assessment with the school community, increased professional development opportunities, family education workshops, community partnerships, family engagement practices for family engagement.

1. Based on the analysis of educational partner input and local data, briefly describe the LEA’s focus area(s) for improvement in Building Partnerships for Student Outcomes.

   Supporting the facilitation and increased access for two-way communication between families and school staff is an area of focus to support the improvement in Building Partnerships for Student Outcomes. Through staff development training focused on school-home communication, valuing families as assets to support student learning, and providing families with ongoing opportunities to be engaged in their student’s education are all examples of ways to support this effort. We also want to continue building capacity with schools to co-lead their own family education workshops, as well as increase participation in the Neighborhood Learning Project and Parent Teacher Home Visit Project. Additionally, we intend to continue our targeted site family engagement pilot program, which is a program that was created to support school teams with ongoing support of family engagement training and practices.

2. Based on the analysis of educational partner input and local data, briefly describe how the LEA will improve engagement of underrepresented families identified during the self-reflection process in relation to Building Partnerships for Student Outcomes.

   Increasing targeted efforts and communication is one way to help improve the engagement of underrepresented families in the district. Through the use of surveys, listening circles, and family education workshops facilitated in different languages, we can create an environment where underrepresented families feel included. Increased opportunities for families to learn about the education system, how to support their students learning at home, and about resources and programs in the community are also key to improving the engagement of underrepresented families.

**Seeking Input for Decision-Making Dashboard Narrative Boxes (Limited to 3,000 characters)**

1. Based on the analysis of educational partner input and local data, briefly describe the LEA’s current strengths and progress in Seeking Input for Decision-Making.

   San Juan is committed to seeking ongoing input and involving families in the decision-making process, especially through opportunities to serve on school and district committees. In partnership with parent advisory committee leadership, the FACE department and Equity department have helped increase the number of opportunities for families to participate in educational partner listening sessions, focus groups, Thought Exchanges, and surveys. Additionally, San Juan has been intentional in increasing engagement with diverse community partners to lead culturally- and linguistically- diverse input gathering sessions. One way in which this is done is through the Family Leadership Academy and Level Up Your Leadership programs, which are leadership development family education class series that give families the knowledge and skills to learn about the education system, being actively engaged in decision making, and being a part of school or district-based committees.

   Another way that we seek input for decision-making is through the FACE Mobile survey, which families, staff, and community members can anonymously complete when they visit the FACE Mobile. Their feedback helps us determine what strengths and areas of opportunity exist to strengthen our supports for families, as well as what types of resources and supports are being requested and utilized. Furthermore, there have been a variety of initiatives that consisted of family and community input gathering, such as the creation of the district’s Strategic Plan, student dress code revisions, and facilities master planning. Additionally, community partners have also been engaged in input and decision making as part of our newly-launched Partnership Connection collaborative, which is a quarterly collaboration that invites all of our community partners into one space so that they can learn more about our district, discuss goals and outcomes, review data, brainstorm ideas to support the needs of our students, families and schools, and network with other community partners.

2. Based on the analysis of educational partner input and local data, briefly describe the LEA’s focus area(s) for improvement in Seeking Input for Decision-Making.

   A key area of focus to support the improvement in seeking input for decision making is creating ongoing communication to various audiences about the importance of family engagement and providing opportunities for families to share input in school and district plans. Specifically, working closely with school site teams to create family engagement teams will help build capacity of staff to better align family engagement strategies with student achievement goals. An area of focus to improve Seeking Input for Decision Making is ongoing data review and analysis to determine which voices or groups are not participating or are harder to reach in input gathering efforts.

3. Based on the analysis of educational partner input and local data, briefly describe how the LEA will improve engagement of underrepresented families identified during the self-reflection process in relation to Seeking Input for Decision-Making.

Creating communication materials available in different languages and in terminology that is understandable can support the improvement of engagement of underrepresented families in relation to seeking input for decision making. Additionally, creating opportunities for families to learn about school and district committees, how they can increase their knowledge of ways to participate in decision making, and who they can contact to get more involved are key strategies to increasing engagement of underrepresented families. Lastly, implementing different ways to communicate and seek feedback from diverse families will help ensure that families have multiple ways to access information.

### School Climate (LCFF Priority 6)

LEAs will provide a narrative summary of the local administration and analysis of a local climate survey that captures a valid measure of student perceptions of school safety and connectedness in at least one grade within the grade span (e.g., K–5, 6–8, 9–12) in a text box provided in the California School Dashboard (response limited to 3,000 characters).

A district developed survey is administered annually to all staff, parents, and students in grades 4-12. This survey includes response items in a variety of domains that are presented to one or more groups. Additionally, two categories are used to address LCAP outcomes in the areas of:
- Connectedness
- Safety

The survey is administered anonymously and respondents are not required to self-identify demographics or program participation. For this reason, results are disaggregated by school type (elementary, K-8, middle, high), and school poverty level based on free/reduced meal eligibility (high density = more than 60%, medium density = between 40%-60%, low density = less than 40%).

The school climate survey was administered from January 9, 2024 - February 6, 2024. The following results and findings are based on 9,840 student responses, which represents approximately 37% of students in grades 4-12.

- **Connectedness**: The percentage of students in grades 4-12 who responded agree or strongly agree was 58.2%. The results varied by school type (elementary = 67.0%, K-8 = 57.1%, middle = 53.0%, high = 55.8%) and by poverty level (low density = 57.8%, medium density = 54.9%, high density = 57.2%).

- **School Safety**: The percentage of students in grades 4-12 who responded agree or strongly agree was 59.9%. The results varied by school type (elementary = 70.1%, K-8 = 54.9%, middle = 55.3%, high = 54.9%) and by poverty level (low density = 62.6%, medium density = 58.6%, high density = 59.3%).

Based on these results, along with additional state and local data, LCAP actions have been developed to build community relationships and to create inclusive, safe, equitable, culturally responsive, and healthy environments for students.

### Access to a Broad Course of Study (LCFF Priority 7)

1. Briefly identify the locally selected measures or tools that the LEA is using to track the extent to which all students have access to, and are enrolled in, a broad course of study, based on grade spans, unduplicated student groups, and individuals with exceptional needs served. (response limited to 1,500 characters)

![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+2)

San Juan Unified measures its progress in the extent to which students have access to, and are enrolled in, a broad course of study for grades TK-12. For grades TK-8, San Juan tracks the percentage of students enrolled in English language Arts (ELA), mathematics, science, social science, and physical education (PE). For grades 9-12, San Juan tracks the percentage of students in grade 12 who received a broad course of study throughout grades 9-12 based on receiving a grade in course/graduation requirements* in ELA, mathematics, science, social science, PE, foreign language, and visual and performing arts (VAPA). This data is gathered, disaggregated, and monitored using information from report cards that are found in the district information system.

Expected course enrollment by grade level:
- TK-5th – 93.2% or more students enrolled in ELA, mathematics, science, social science, and PE.
- 6th-8th – 94.5% or more students enrolled in ELA, mathematics, science, social science, and PE.
- 9th-12th – 90.4% or more students enrolled in ELA, mathematics, science, social science, PE, foreign language, and VAPA.

*Graduation Requirements: English language arts (4 yrs.), math (2 yrs.), science (2 yrs.), social science (3.5 yrs.), health (0.5 yrs.), visual and performing arts OR career technical education (1 yr.), and physical education (2 yrs.).

Using the locally selected measures or tools, summarize the extent to which all students have access to, and are enrolled in, a broad course of study. The summary should identify any differences across school sites and student groups in access to, and enrollment in, a broad course of study, and may describe progress over time in the extent to which all students have access to, and are enrolled in, a broad course of study. (response limited to 1,500 characters)

The percentage of TK-5th grade students who received a broad course of study based on enrollment in English language arts, math, science, social science, and physical education included:
- All: 93.2% (percentage of eligible students with a report card grade in all broad course of study subject areas)
- AA: 89.6%
- AI: 91.4%
- AS: 90.3%
- EL: 91.1%

3. Given the results of the tool or locally selected measures, identify the barriers preventing the LEA from providing access to a broad course of study for all students. (response limited to 1,500 characters)

A barrier to students receiving a full course of study is ensuring that students have access to both core instruction that addresses grade level content and additional program, service, and intervention support in English language arts, math, and English language development (ELD). This may disproportionately impact students who receive intervention, designated ELD instruction, or special education services to meet Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals, which may remove students from the comprehensive core classroom instruction for specific blocks of time during the day.

4. In response to the results of the tool or locally selected measures, what revisions, decisions, or new actions will the LEA implement, or has the LEA implemented, to ensure access to a broad course of study for all students? (response limited to 1,500 characters)

The following actions are being taken to increase access and opportunity to a broad course of study, especially for our English learners (EL) and students with disabilities (SWD):
- Expand and deepen professional learning for teachers around designated and integrated English language development instruction

2023 Local Performance Indicator Self-Reflection for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 13 484
<!-- Page 485 -->
![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+2)

- Support general and special education teams through professional learning and collaboration time in order to increase the use of inclusive practices for students with disabilities in general education environments
- Increase access to general education core content for students with disabilities by refining the general education enrollment process

These actions are intended to increase the time that EL and SWD remain in the core classroom, increase the rate of students reclassified as English proficient, and create space in schedules to enroll in a broad course of study.

Credit recovery options are being implemented across all high school campuses during the school year and summer to assist students with credit and grade recovery. Additionally, San Juan Unified’s scaffolded approach to building back towards pre-COVID-approved graduation requirements is increasing enrollment in a rigorous course of study for each student in high school. The class of 2024 was offered a safety net of a 160-credit requirement. Part of the thoughtful approach to building back graduation requirements introduced 10 additional science credits for the class of 2024. Our goal is not to lower graduation requirements permanently, but rather adjust temporarily as we continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 on future graduating classes. We are currently conducting a Graduation Requirements workgroup that has been meeting monthly to analyze data, gather community input, and create actionable options for continuing years. The goal is to identify options for students, gather data to measure students' needs, and a process for supporting students on their path to graduation.

# LCFF Budget Overview for Parents

The LCFF gives school districts more flexibility in deciding how to use state funds. In exchange, school districts must work with parents, educators, students, and the community to develop a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) that shows how they will use these funds to serve students.

![Budgeted Expenditures in the LCAP](attachment2.png)

This chart provides a quick summary of how much San Juan Unified School District plans to spend for 2024-25. It shows how much of the total is tied to planned actions and services in the LCAP.

The text description of the above chart is as follows: San Juan Unified School District plans to spend $702,199,469 for the 2024-25 school year. Of that amount, $90,382,011 is tied to actions/services in the LCAP and $611,817,458 is not included in the LCAP. The budgeted expenditures that are not included in the LCAP will be used for the following:

- District and school general operating and housekeeping expenses
- Routine repair and maintenance
- Insurance
- Transportation
- Instructional materials and resources
- Special education
- Other certificated and classified employee salaries and benefits

These expenditures, while not included in the Local Control and Accountability Plan, are integral to the district's ability to serve students and families. In 2024-25, San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD) will be deficit spending to reduce funding reserves.

### Goal Analysis
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year. A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

All actions within goal 1 were implemented as planned without substantive differences. The challenges experienced during implementation included: 

2024 LCAP Annual Update for the 2023-24 LCAP for San Juan Unified School District Page 12 of 498
<!-- Page 499 -->
- Staff shortage, vacancies, hiring, and resignations.
- Substitute shortage for staff to attend professional learning.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.

Material differences between budgeted and estimated actual expenditures were due to staffing and substitute shortages, vacancies, and shifting funding to sources outside of the LCAP.

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.

The actions in goal 1 contributed to the following outcomes:
- San Juan did not meet the eligibility criteria for Differentiated Assistance in chronic absenteeism for African American, English learner, foster youth, homeless youth, and students with disabilities.
- Chronic absenteeism rates reduced overall, especially for African American, English learner, Hispanic, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and students with disabilities.

Programs and services within our LCAP actions that contributed to the improvement San Juan Unified made towards achieving this goal include:
- School attendance interventions that provide wraparound supports to students and families.
- Family engagement workshops, opportunities, resources, and communication in languages other than English.
- Transportation for homeless and foster youth.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

Goal: 2024-27 LCAP goals will be revised to align with state priority areas and required LCAP metrics.

Metrics: 2024-27 LCAP metrics will include required state and local data that reflects the most recent full-year data as well as all education code required student groups in the reporting of data.

Actions: 2024-27 LCAP actions will be revised to align with new goals, required metrics, data results, input from educational partners, and will address student groups and schools with the lowest performance levels on the 2023 CA School Dashboard indicators.

An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.  
All actions within goal 2 were implemented as planned without substantive differences. The challenges experienced during implementation included:  
- Substitute shortage impacted staff professional development attendance.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services.  
Material differences between budgeted and estimated actual expenditures were due to staffing and substitute shortages, vacancies, and shifting funding to sources outside of the LCAP.

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.  
The actions in goal 2 contributed to the following outcomes:  
- San Juan did not meet the eligibility criteria for Differentiated Assistance in suspension rates for African American, foster youth, homeless youth, and students with disabilities.  
- Suspension rates declined for African American, English learner, Filipino, foster youth, homeless, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and students with disabilities.

Programs and services within our LCAP actions that contributed to the progress San Juan Unified made toward this goal include:  
- Counseling and mentoring to support social, emotional, and mental health.  
- Alternative practices to suspension such as Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), Restorative Practices (RP), Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL).  
- Staff for campus supervision and relationships.  
- Staff training and professional learning.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.  
Goal: 2024-27 LCAP goals will be revised to align with state priority areas and required LCAP metrics.  
Metrics: 2024-27 LCAP metrics will include required state and local data that reflects the most recent full-year data as well as all education.

code required student groups in the reporting of data.

Actions: 2024-27 LCAP actions will be revised to align with new goals, required metrics, data results, input from educational partners, and will address student groups and schools with the lowest performance levels on the 2023 CA School Dashboard indicators.
- See addendum A for schools within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator.
- See addendum B for student groups within the LEA and within each school that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator.

A report of the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for last year’s actions may be found in the Annual Update Table. A report of the Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services for last year’s actions may be found in the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table.

An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.  

All actions within goal 3 were implemented as planned without substantive differences. The challenges experienced during implementation included:  
- Staff shortage impacting ability to find highly qualified staff to fill vacancies, teach before and after school programs, and implement programs and services.  
- Substitute shortage for staff to attend professional learning.  

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.  

No substantive material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures.  

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.  

The actions in goal 3 contributed to the following outcomes:  

English Language Arts (ELA)  
- Increased ELA proficiency for American Indian/Alaskan Native, foster youth, Pacific Islander, and students with disabilities.  
- Decreased ELA proficiency for African American, Asian, and English learner.  
- Lowest performance ELA for African American, English learner, and homeless.  

Math  
- Increased math proficiency for American Indian/Alaskan Native, Filipino, foster youth, Hispanic, and students with disabilities.  
- Decreased math proficiency for Asian.  
- Lowest performance in math for African American, English learner, and homeless.  

English Learner Progress  
- Decreased English learner progress towards English language proficiency.  
- Increased English learner reclassification rate to Fluent English Proficient.  

Programs and services within our LCAP actions that contributed to the progress San Juan Unified made toward this goal include:  
- ELA: Lexia English, Aspire, Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling (LETRS), Universal Design for Learning (UDL), tutoring.  
- Math: Math Recovery, UDL, tutoring.

- English learner Progress: EL Achieve, Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD), Bilingual Instructional Assistants, translators, Newcomer support.

To address the areas in need of improvement, we will use a continuous improvement process that includes:
- Building on the work we have done to maintain continuity of learning.
- Analyzing multiples sources of data that includes educational partner input, state and local data, practitioner experience, and research to identify the unique needs of our students.
- Adjusting existing and creating new actions to address the unique needs of our students.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

Goal: 2024-27 LCAP goals will be revised to align with state priority areas and required LCAP metrics.

Metrics: 2024-27 LCAP metrics will include required state and local data that reflects the most recent full-year data as well as all education code required student groups in the reporting of data.

Actions: 2024-27 LCAP actions will be revised to align with new goals, required metrics, data results, input from educational partners, and will address student groups and schools with the lowest performance levels on the 2023 CA School Dashboard indicators.
- See addendum A for schools within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator.
- See addendum B for student groups within the LEA and within each school that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator.

A report of the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for last year’s actions may be found in the Annual Update Table. A report of the Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services for last year’s actions may be found in the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table.

### Goal Analysis
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

All actions within goal 4 were implemented as planned without substantive differences. The challenges experienced during implementation included:
- Staff turnover, shortage, and vacancies.
- Grant for First-Five initiative has changed impacting program funding.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.

Material differences between budgeted and estimated actual expenditures were due to staffing shortages, vacancies, shifting funding to sources outside of the LCAP, and summer school expenditures not yet incurred.

- Describe the overall implementation of the actions to achieve the articulated goal. Include a discussion of relevant challenges and successes experienced with the implementation process. This must include any instance where the LEA did not implement a planned action or implemented a planned action in a manner that differs substantively from how it was described in the adopted LCAP.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.
- Explain material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and between the Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services, as applicable. Minor variances in expenditures or percentages do not need to be addressed, and a dollar-for-dollar accounting is not required.

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.
- Describe the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle. “Effectiveness” means the degree to which the actions were successful in producing the desired result and “ineffectiveness” means that the actions did not produce any significant or desired result.
  - In some cases, not all actions in a goal will be intended to improve performance on all of the metrics associated with the goal.
  - When responding to this prompt, LEAs may assess the effectiveness of a single action or group of actions within the goal in the context of performance on a single metric or group of specific metrics within the goal that are applicable to the action(s). Grouping actions with metrics will allow for more robust analysis of whether the strategy the LEA is using to impact a specified set of metrics is working and increase transparency for educational partners. LEAs are encouraged to use such an approach when goals include multiple actions and metrics that are not closely associated.
  - Beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.
- Describe any changes made to this goal, expected outcomes, metrics, or actions to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis and analysis of the data provided in the Dashboard or other local data, as applicable.
  - As noted above, beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period. For actions that have been identified as ineffective, the LEA must identify the ineffective action and must include a description of the following:
    - The reasons for the ineffectiveness, and
    - How changes to the action will result in a new or strengthened approach.

# Comprehensive Support and Improvement

An LEA with a school or schools eligible for comprehensive support and improvement must respond to the following prompts.

## Schools Identified
A list of the schools in the LEA that are eligible for comprehensive support and improvement.

- Cottage Elementary
- Kingswood K-8
- La Entrada Continuation High
- La Vista Center
- San Juan High
- Sylvan Middle

## Support for Identified Schools
A description of how the LEA has or will support its eligible schools in developing comprehensive support and improvement plans.

San Juan Unified School District will provide schools that meet the criteria for Comprehensive Support and Improvement (CSI) the opportunity to participate in a Networked Improvement Community (NIC). The NIC is a five-part series that works through the four stages of continuous improvement which includes conducting a needs assessment and root cause analysis, defining goals and evidence-based interventions, prototyping and implementing solutions, and measuring and reporting on the impact of the improvement plans. The purpose is for each school site to make changes in practice that reflect student needs and result in improved outcomes, experiences, and opportunities for students.

Each of the five network meetings will provide school leadership teams with an opportunity to engage in the continuous improvement process to address their Problem of Practice (i.e., suspension, attendance, African American achievement, etc.), and the learning space to collaborate with partner school sites within the network to share ideas, resources, and best practices. In addition to the network meetings, a coach will be assigned to each school site to provide expert guidance and personalized support throughout the NIC process. The coach will also act as a thought partner during the network meetings to help eligible CSI schools achieve their goals, and to ensure that school leadership teams are equipped with the necessary tools and resources to drive improvement. Collectively, the NIC and coach will support the development and implementation of the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) in alignment with the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP).

## Monitoring and Evaluating Effectiveness
A description of how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the plan to support student and school improvement.

The district NIC facilitator and coach will engage in the following practices to monitor and evaluate the plan to support student and school improvement: 1) provide regular check-ins with site administrators and school improvement teams to refine and modify improvement plans based on regular review of data and information; 2) review each school’s Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) plans and inquiry cycles to identify measurable and actionable goals; and 3) create and share site reports with each school to provide feedback and monitor progress of plans.

# Engaging Educational Partners

A summary of the process used to engage educational partners in the development of the LCAP.

School districts and county offices of education must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, local bargaining units, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.

Charter schools must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.

An LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also consult with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for each applicable school.

**LCAP PRESENTATIONS:**
- San Juan Unified School District Board of Education
- Local Control and Accountability Plan Parent Advisory Committee (LCAP PAC)
- District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC)

On May 23, 2024, a draft plan of the LCAP was presented to the Local Control and Accountability Parent Advisory Committee (LCAP PAC) and the District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC) in separate meetings. Both groups reviewed the draft LCAP and provided comments to the superintendent. The superintendent’s responses were posted on the district LCAP website prior to the public hearing and were shared with the LCAP PAC and the DELAC.

The draft LCAP was posted on the district LCAP website on May 23, 2024 to allow for public review and comment prior to the public hearing on June 11, 2024. On June 25, 2024, the LCAP and district budget were adopted by the Board of Education, and the Local Indicator results were reported.

A description of how the adopted LCAP was influenced by the feedback provided by educational partners.

District focus teams and the Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) team reviewed and monitored 2023-24 LCAP actions, metrics, and expenditures throughout the year. Additionally, LCAP PAC perspectives and insights, educational partner key themes, and climate survey results were used to support the planning and development of the 2024-25 LCAP.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal

| Goal # | Description                                                                 | Type of Goal |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 1      | Student Achievement and Implementation of State Standards - Improve achievement and outcomes for all students as measured by performance on statewide assessments, English proficiency, and college and career preparedness. | Broad Goal   |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.

- Priority 1: Basic (Conditions of Learning)
- Priority 2: State Standards (Conditions of Learning)
- Priority 4: Pupil Achievement (Pupil Outcomes)
- Priority 8: Other Pupil Outcomes (Pupil Outcomes)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

A review of Dashboard data results showed:
- African American, English learner, and homeless student groups received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard English language arts and mathematics indicators.
- Students with Disabilities student group received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard college/career indicator.
- 29 out of 65 schools had one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator (see addendum A).
- 53 out of 65 schools had one or more student groups that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator (see addendum B).

During the 2021-24 LCAP cycle, educational partners indicated that:
- LCAP goals were too broad and difficult to measure using data.
- Including current year and previous year data in LCAP was confusing.
- Not all required student groups were reported in the LCAP.

State and local data and educational partner input revealed a need to increase:
- Alignment between goals, metrics, and actions.
- Clarity to the public and board about our goals, and how we are measuring and monitoring progress.
- Focus on English learner, low income, foster youth, and student groups with the lowest performance level on a Dashboard indicator.

As a result, the 2024-27 LCAP:
- Goals are aligned to the state priority areas and required LCAP metrics.
- Metrics include required state and local data that reflects the most recent full-year data as well as all education code required student groups in the reporting of data.

Page 54 of 540
<!-- Page 541 -->
![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+2)

- Actions are grouped and aligned to goals, required metrics, data results, input from educational partners, and address student groups and schools with the lowest performance levels on the 2023 CA School Dashboard indicators.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal

| Goal # | Description                                                                 | Type of Goal |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 2      | Student Engagement and Course Access - Provide students with engaging programs, course work, and opportunities that address attendance, dropout, graduation, and access to a broad course of study. | Broad Goal   |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.

- **Priority 1:** Basic (Conditions of Learning)
- **Priority 5:** Pupil Engagement (Engagement)
- **Priority 7:** Course Access (Conditions of Learning)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

A review of Dashboard data results showed:
- African American, English learner, and homeless student groups received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard English language arts and mathematics indicators.
- Students with Disabilities student group received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard college/career indicator.
- 29 out of 65 schools had one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator (see addendum A).
- 53 out of 65 schools had one or more student groups that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator (see addendum B).

During the 2021-24 LCAP cycle, educational partners indicated that:
- LCAP goals were too broad and difficult to measure using data.
- Including current year and previous year data in LCAP was confusing.
- Not all required student groups were reported in the LCAP.

State and local data and educational partner input revealed a need to increase:
- Alignment between goals, metrics, and actions.
- Clarity to the public and board about our goals, and how we are measuring and monitoring progress.
- Focus on English learner, low income, foster youth, and student groups with the lowest performance level on a Dashboard indicator.

As a result, the 2024-27 LCAP:
- Goals are aligned to the state priority areas and required LCAP metrics.
- Metrics include required state and local data that reflects the most recent full-year data as well as all education code required student groups in the reporting of data.

- Actions are grouped and aligned to goals, required metrics, data results, input from educational partners, and address student groups and schools with the lowest performance levels on the 2023 CA School Dashboard indicators.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal

| Goal # | Description                                                                                          | Type of Goal |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 3      | School Conditions, Climate, and Family Engagement - Address factors both inside and outside the classroom that impact student success such as family engagement, health, safety, discipline, connectedness, facilities, materials, and staffing. | Broad Goal    |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.

- **Priority 1:** Basic (Conditions of Learning)
- **Priority 3:** Parental Involvement (Engagement)
- **Priority 6:** School Climate (Engagement)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

A review of Dashboard data results showed:
- African American, English learner, and homeless student groups received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard English language arts and mathematics indicators.
- Students with Disabilities student group received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard college/career indicator.
- 29 out of 65 schools had one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator (see addendum A).
- 53 out of 65 schools had one or more student groups that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator (see addendum B).

During the 2021-24 LCAP cycle, educational partners indicated that:
- LCAP goals were too broad and difficult to measure using data.
- Including current year and previous year data in LCAP was confusing.
- Not all required student groups were reported in the LCAP.

State and local data and educational partner input revealed a need to increase:
- Alignment between goals, metrics, and actions.
- Clarity to the public and board about our goals, and how we are measuring and monitoring progress.
- Focus on English learner, low income, foster youth, and student groups with the lowest performance level on a Dashboard indicator.

As a result, the 2024-27 LCAP:
- Goals are aligned to the state priority areas and required LCAP metrics.
- Metrics include required state and local data that reflects the most recent full-year data as well as all education code required student groups in the reporting of data.
<!-- Page 574 -->
![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+2)

- Actions are grouped and aligned to goals, required metrics, data results, input from educational partners, and address student groups and schools with the lowest performance levels on the 2023 CA School Dashboard indicators.

Schools with socioeconomically disadvantaged rates of +70% and non-stability rates of +25% are eligible to receive state Equity Multiplier Funds. (Non-Stability Rate = Percent of student who did not complete 180 instructional days at one school)

The State requirements to access these funds include developing at least one focus goal that addresses:
- All pupil groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the California School Dashboard.
- Any underlying issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.

School sites receiving Equity Multiplier funds engaged their educational partners to identify the unique needs of the student groups with one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator. Based on a review and analysis of educational partner input and state/local data, Equity Multiplier schools developed LCAP actions that are principally directed to improving outcomes in the required areas.

|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 10     | Schools with Non-Stability Rates of +25% and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Rates of +70% (La Vista Center) - Within three years, improve outcomes for student groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators, and address any underlying issues with credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators. | Focus Goal   |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.

- Priority 1: Basic (Conditions of Learning)
- Priority 8: Other Pupil Outcomes (Pupil Outcomes)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

Schools with socioeconomically disadvantaged rates of +70% and non-stability rates of +25% are eligible to receive state Equity Multiplier Funds. (Non-Stability Rate = Percent of student who did not complete 180 instructional days at one school)

The State requirements to access these funds include developing at least one focus goal that addresses:
- All pupil groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the California School Dashboard.
- Any underlying issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.

School sites receiving Equity Multiplier funds engaged their educational partners to identify the unique needs of the student groups with one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator. Based on a review and analysis of educational partner input and state/local data, Equity Multiplier schools developed LCAP actions that are principally directed to improving outcomes in the required areas.

|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 13     | Schools with Non-Stability Rates of +25% and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Rates of +70% (Starr King K-8) - Within three years, improve outcomes for student groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators, and address any underlying issues with credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators. | Focus Goal |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.

- **Priority 1:** Basic (Conditions of Learning)
- **Priority 8:** Other Pupil Outcomes (Pupil Outcomes)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

Schools with socioeconomically disadvantaged rates of +70% and non-stability rates of +25% are eligible to receive state Equity Multiplier Funds. (Non-Stability Rate = Percent of student who do not complete 180 instructional days at one school)

The State requirements to access these funds include developing at least one focus goal that addresses:
- All pupil groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the California School Dashboard.
- Any underlying issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.

School sites receiving Equity Multiplier funds engaged their educational partners to identify the unique needs of the student groups with one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator. Based on a review and analysis of educational partner input and state/local data, Equity Multiplier schools developed LCAP actions that are principally directed to improving outcomes in the required areas.

N/A  

**Additional Concentration Grant Funding**  
A description of the plan for how the additional concentration grant add-on funding identified above will be used to increase the number of staff providing direct services to students at schools that have a high concentration (above 55 percent) of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students, as applicable.  

Concentration grant funds will be used to improve working conditions for staff, learning conditions for students, stabilize staffing at highest-need schools to maintain continuity of learning, and promote increased opportunities for differentiated instruction. A pilot will be implemented with six of San Juan Unified’s highest-density schools in secondary and K-8. These schools include Encina Preparatory High, San Juan High, Arcade Fundamental Middle, Katherine Johnson Middle, Starr King K-8, and Kingswood K-8.

# Local Control and Accountability Plan Instructions
## Plan Summary
## Engaging Educational Partners
## Goals and Actions
## Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students

For additional questions or technical assistance related to the completion of the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) template, please contact the local county office of education (COE), or the California Department of Education’s (CDE’s) Local Agency Systems Support Office, by phone at 916-319-0809 or by email at LCFF@cde.ca.gov.

## Introduction and Instructions
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) requires local educational agencies (LEAs) to engage their local educational partners in an annual planning process to evaluate their progress within eight state priority areas encompassing all statutory metrics (COEs have 10 state priorities). LEAs document the results of this planning process in the LCAP using the template adopted by the State Board of Education.

The LCAP development process serves three distinct, but related functions:

- **Comprehensive Strategic Planning:** The process of developing and annually updating the LCAP supports comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the California School Dashboard (California Education Code [EC] Section 52064[e][1]). Strategic planning that is comprehensive connects budgetary decisions to teaching and learning performance data. LEAs should continually evaluate the hard choices they make about the use of limited resources to meet student and community needs to ensure opportunities and outcomes are improved for all students.

- **Meaningful Engagement of Educational Partners:** The LCAP development process should result in an LCAP that reflects decisions made through meaningful engagement (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Local educational partners possess valuable perspectives and insights about an LEA's programs and services. Effective strategic planning will incorporate these perspectives and insights in order to identify potential goals and actions to be included in the LCAP.

- **Accountability and Compliance:** The LCAP serves an important accountability function because the nature of some LCAP template sections require LEAs to show that they have complied with various requirements specified in the LCFF statutes and regulations, most notably:

  - Demonstrating that LEAs are increasing or improving services for foster youth, English learners, including long-term English learners, and low-income students in proportion to the amount of additional funding those students generate under LCFF (EC Section 52064[b][4-6]).

  - Establishing goals, supported by actions and related expenditures, that address the statutory priority areas and statutory metrics (EC sections 52064[b][1] and [2]).

  - **NOTE:** As specified in EC Section 62064(b)(1), the LCAP must provide a description of the annual goals, for all pupils and each subgroup of pupils identified pursuant to EC Section 52052, to be achieved for each of the state priorities. Beginning in 2023–24, EC

![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+2)

Section 52052 identifies long-term English learners as a separate and distinct pupil subgroup with a numerical significance at 15 students.

- Annually reviewing and updating the LCAP to reflect progress toward the goals (EC Section 52064[b][7]).
- Ensuring that all increases attributable to supplemental and concentration grant calculations, including concentration grant add-on funding and/or LCFF carryover, are reflected in the LCAP (EC sections 52064[b][6], [8], and [11]).

The LCAP template, like each LEA’s final adopted LCAP, is a document, not a process. LEAs must use the template to memorialize the outcome of their LCAP development process, which must: (a) reflect comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the California School Dashboard (Dashboard), (b) through meaningful engagement with educational partners and (c) meets legal requirements, as reflected in the final adopted LCAP. The sections included within the LCAP template do not and cannot reflect the full development process, just as the LCAP template itself is not intended as a tool for engaging educational partners.

If a county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction over a single school district, the county board of education and the governing board of the school district may adopt and file for review and approval a single LCAP consistent with the requirements in EC sections 52060, 52062, 52066, 52068, and 52070. The LCAP must clearly articulate to which entity’s budget (school district or county superintendent of schools) all budgeted and actual expenditures are aligned.

The revised LCAP template for the 2024–25, 2025–26, and 2026–27 school years reflects statutory changes made through Senate Bill 114 (Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review), Chapter 48, Statutes of 2023.

At its most basic, the adopted LCAP should attempt to distill not just what the LEA is doing for students in transitional kindergarten through grade twelve (TK–12), but also allow educational partners to understand why, and whether those strategies are leading to improved opportunities and outcomes for students. LEAs are strongly encouraged to use language and a level of detail in their adopted LCAPs intended to be meaningful and accessible for the LEA’s diverse educational partners and the broader public.

In developing and finalizing the LCAP for adoption, LEAs are encouraged to keep the following overarching frame at the forefront of the strategic planning and educational partner engagement functions:

Given present performance across the state priorities and on indicators in the Dashboard, how is the LEA using its budgetary resources to respond to TK–12 student and community needs, and address any performance gaps, including by meeting its obligation to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students?

LEAs are encouraged to focus on a set of metrics and actions which, based on research, experience, and input gathered from educational partners, the LEA believes will have the biggest impact on behalf of its TK–12 students.

These instructions address the requirements for each section of the LCAP, but may include information about effective practices when developing the LCAP and completing the LCAP document. Additionally, the beginning of each template section includes information emphasizing the purpose that section serves.

![Plan Summary](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Plan+Summary)

**Plan Summary**

**Purpose**  
A well-developed Plan Summary section provides a meaningful context for the LCAP. This section provides information about an LEA's community as well as relevant information about student needs and performance. In order to present a meaningful context for the rest of the LCAP, the content of this section should be clearly and meaningfully related to the content included throughout each subsequent section of the LCAP.

**Requirements and Instructions**

**General Information**  
A description of the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades transitional kindergarten–12, as applicable to the LEA.  
Briefly describe the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades TK–12, as applicable to the LEA.
- For example, information about an LEA in terms of geography, enrollment, employment, the number and size of specific schools, recent community challenges, and other such information the LEA may wish to include can enable a reader to more fully understand the LEA’s LCAP.
- As part of this response, identify all schools within the LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funding.

**Reflections: Annual Performance**  
A reflection on annual performance based on a review of the California School Dashboard (Dashboard) and local data.  
Reflect on the LEA’s annual performance on the Dashboard and local data. This may include both successes and challenges identified by the LEA during the development process.  
LEAs are encouraged to highlight how they are addressing the identified needs of student groups, and/or schools within the LCAP as part of this response.  
As part of this response, the LEA must identify the following, which will remain unchanged during the three-year LCAP cycle:
- Any school within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard;
- Any student group within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard; and/or
- Any student group within a school within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard.

**Reflections: Technical Assistance**  
As applicable, a summary of the work underway as part of technical assistance.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 251 c737
<!-- Page 738 -->
![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+2)

Annually identify the reason(s) the LEA is eligible for or has requested technical assistance consistent with EC sections 47607.3, 52071, 52071.5, 52072, or 52072.5, and provide a summary of the work underway as part of receiving technical assistance. The most common form of this technical assistance is frequently referred to as Differentiated Assistance, however this also includes LEAs that have requested technical assistance from their COE.

- If the LEA is not eligible for or receiving technical assistance, the LEA may respond to this prompt as “Not Applicable.”

**Comprehensive Support and Improvement**  
An LEA with a school or schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement (CSI) under the Every Student Succeeds Act must respond to the following prompts:

**Schools Identified**  
A list of the schools in the LEA that are eligible for comprehensive support and improvement.
- Identify the schools within the LEA that have been identified for CSI.

**Support for Identified Schools**  
A description of how the LEA has or will support its eligible schools in developing comprehensive support and improvement plans.
- Describe how the LEA has or will support the identified schools in developing CSI plans that included a school-level needs assessment, evidence-based interventions, and the identification of any resource inequities to be addressed through the implementation of the CSI plan.

**Monitoring and Evaluating Effectiveness**  
A description of how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the plan to support student and school improvement.
- Describe how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the CSI plan to support student and school improvement.

**Engaging Educational Partners**  
**Purpose**  
Significant and purposeful engagement of parents, students, educators, and other educational partners, including those representing the student groups identified by LCFF, is critical to the development of the LCAP and the budget process. Consistent with statute, such engagement should support comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the Dashboard, accountability, and improvement across the state priorities and locally identified priorities (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Engagement of educational partners is an ongoing, annual process.

This section is designed to reflect how the engagement of educational partners influenced the decisions reflected in the adopted LCAP. The goal is to allow educational partners that participate in the LCAP development process and the broader public to understand how the LEA engaged educational partners and the impact of that engagement. LEAs are encouraged to keep this goal in the forefront when completing this section.

![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+2)

Describe any goals, metrics, actions, or budgeted expenditures in the LCAP that were influenced by or developed in response to the educational partner feedback.

- A sufficient response to this prompt will provide educational partners and the public with clear, specific information about how the engagement process influenced the development of the LCAP. This may include a description of how the LEA prioritized requests of educational partners within the context of the budgetary resources available or otherwise prioritized areas of focus within the LCAP.
  
- An LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funds must include a description of how the consultation with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds influenced the development of the adopted LCAP.

- For the purposes of this prompt, this may also include, but is not necessarily limited to:
  - Inclusion of a goal or decision to pursue a Focus Goal (as described below)
  - Inclusion of metrics other than the statutorily required metrics
  - Determination of the target outcome on one or more metrics
  - Inclusion of performance by one or more student groups in the Measuring and Reporting Results subsection
  - Inclusion of action(s) or a group of actions
  - Elimination of action(s) or group of actions

  - Analysis of material differences in expenditures
  - Analysis of changes made to a goal for the ensuing LCAP year based on the annual update process
  - Analysis of challenges or successes in the implementation of actions

Goals and Actions
Purpose
Well-developed goals will clearly communicate to educational partners what the LEA plans to accomplish, what the LEA plans to do in order to accomplish the goal, and how the LEA will know when it has accomplished the goal. A goal statement, associated metrics and expected outcomes, and the actions included in the goal must be in alignment. The explanation for why the LEA included a goal is an opportunity for LEAs to clearly communicate to educational partners and the public why, among the various strengths and areas for improvement highlighted by performance data and strategies and actions that could be pursued, the LEA decided to pursue this goal, and the related metrics, expected outcomes, actions, and expenditures.

A well-developed goal can be focused on the performance relative to a metric or metrics for all students, a specific student group(s), narrowing performance gaps, or implementing programs or strategies expected to impact outcomes. LEAs should assess the performance of their student groups when developing goals and the related actions to achieve such goals.

<!-- Page 742 -->
![Requirements and Instructions](https://example.com/image.png)

# Requirements and Instructions

LEAs should prioritize the goals, specific actions, and related expenditures included within the LCAP within one or more state priorities. LEAs must consider performance on the state and local indicators, including their locally collected and reported data for the local indicators that are included in the Dashboard, in determining whether and how to prioritize its goals within the LCAP. As previously stated, strategic planning that is comprehensive connects budgetary decisions to teaching and learning performance data. LEAs should continually evaluate the hard choices they make about the use of limited resources to meet student and community needs to ensure opportunities and outcomes are improved for all students, and to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the Dashboard.

In order to support prioritization of goals, the LCAP template provides LEAs with the option of developing three different kinds of goals:

- **Focus Goal:** A Focus Goal is relatively more concentrated in scope and may focus on a fewer number of metrics to measure improvement. A Focus Goal statement will be time bound and make clear how the goal is to be measured.
  - All Equity Multiplier goals must be developed as focus goals. For additional information, see Required Focus Goal(s) for LEAs Receiving Equity Multiplier Funding below.

- **Broad Goal:** A Broad Goal is relatively less concentrated in its scope and may focus on improving performance across a wide range of metrics.

- **Maintenance of Progress Goal:** A Maintenance of Progress Goal includes actions that may be ongoing without significant changes and allows an LEA to track performance on any metrics not addressed in the other goals of the LCAP.

## Requirement to Address the LCFF State Priorities

At a minimum, the LCAP must address all LCFF priorities and associated metrics articulated in EC sections 52060(d) and 52066(d), as applicable to the LEA. The LCFF State Priorities Summary provides a summary of EC sections 52060(d) and 52066(d) to aid in the development of the LCAP.

Respond to the following prompts, as applicable:

### Focus Goal(s)
**Description**

The description provided for a Focus Goal must be specific, measurable, and time bound.

- An LEA develops a Focus Goal to address areas of need that may require or benefit from a more specific and data intensive approach.

- The Focus Goal can explicitly reference the metric(s) by which achievement of the goal will be measured and the time frame according to which the LEA expects to achieve the goal.

### Type of Goal

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 256 c742
<!-- Page 743 -->
![Attachment 2](https://example.com/image.png)

Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Focus Goal.

State Priorities addressed by this goal.  
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.  
Explain why the LEA has chosen to prioritize this goal.
- An explanation must be based on Dashboard data or other locally collected data.
- LEAs must describe how the LEA identified this goal for focused attention, including relevant consultation with educational partners.
- LEAs are encouraged to promote transparency and understanding around the decision to pursue a focus goal.

Required Focus Goal(s) for LEAs Receiving Equity Multiplier Funding  
Description  
LEAs receiving Equity Multiplier funding must include one or more focus goals for each school generating Equity Multiplier funding. In addition to addressing the focus goal requirements described above, LEAs must adhere to the following requirements.

Focus goals for Equity Multiplier schoolsites must address the following:
(A) All student groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the Dashboard, and  
(B) Any underlying issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators, if applicable.  
- Focus Goals for each and every Equity Multiplier schoolsite must identify specific metrics for each identified student group, as applicable.  
- An LEA may create a single goal for multiple Equity Multiplier schoolsites if those schoolsites have the same student group(s) performing at the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the Dashboard or, experience similar issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.
  - When creating a single goal for multiple Equity Multiplier schoolsites, the goal must identify the student groups and the performance levels on the Dashboard that the Focus Goal is addressing; or,  
  - The common issues the schoolsites are experiencing in credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators, if applicable.

Type of Goal

Page 257 c743
<!-- Page 744 -->
![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+2)

Identify the type of goal being implemented as an Equity Multiplier Focus Goal.

**State Priorities addressed by this goal.**  
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

**An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.**  
Explain why the LEA has chosen to prioritize this goal.

- An explanation must be based on Dashboard data or other locally collected data.
- LEAs must describe how the LEA identified this goal for focused attention, including relevant consultation with educational partners.
- LEAs are encouraged to promote transparency and understanding around the decision to pursue a focus goal.
- In addition to this information, the LEA must also identify:
  - The school or schools to which the goal applies.

LEAs are encouraged to approach an Equity Multiplier goal from a wholistic standpoint, considering how the goal might maximize student outcomes through the use of LCFF and other funding in addition to Equity Multiplier funds.

- Equity Multiplier funds must be used to supplement, not supplant, funding provided to Equity Multiplier schoolsites for purposes of the LCFF, the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (ELO-P), the Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialists (LCRS) Grant Program, and/or the California Community Schools Partnership Program (CCSPP).
- This means that Equity Multiplier funds must not be used to replace funding that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement LEA-wide actions identified in the LCAP or that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement provisions of the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP.

**Note:** EC Section 42238.024(b)(1) (California Legislative Information) requires that Equity Multiplier funds be used for the provision of evidence-based services and supports for students. Evidence-based services and supports are based on objective evidence that has informed the design of the service or support and/or guides the modification of those services and supports. Evidence-based supports and strategies are most commonly based on educational research and/or metrics of LEA, school, and/or student performance.

**Broad Goal Description**  
Describe what the LEA plans to achieve through the actions included in the goal.

- The description of a broad goal will be clearly aligned with the expected measurable outcomes included for the goal.  
2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 258 c744
<!-- Page 745 -->
- The goal description organizes the actions and expected outcomes in a cohesive and consistent manner.
- A goal description is specific enough to be measurable in either quantitative or qualitative terms. A broad goal is not as specific as a focus goal. While it is specific enough to be measurable, there are many different metrics for measuring progress toward the goal.

### Type of Goal
Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Broad Goal.

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
Explain why the LEA developed this goal and how the actions and metrics grouped together will help achieve the goal.

### Maintenance of Progress Goal
**Description**  
Describe how the LEA intends to maintain the progress made in the LCFF State Priorities not addressed by the other goals in the LCAP.
- Use this type of goal to address the state priorities and applicable metrics not addressed within the other goals in the LCAP.
- The state priorities and metrics to be addressed in this section are those for which the LEA, in consultation with educational partners, has determined to maintain actions and monitor progress while focusing implementation efforts on the actions covered by other goals in the LCAP.

### Type of Goal
Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Maintenance of Progress Goal.

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
Explain how the actions will sustain the progress exemplified by the related metrics.

### Measuring and Reporting Results:
For each LCAP year, identify the metric(s) that the LEA will use to track progress toward the expected outcomes.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 259 c745
<!-- Page 746 -->
- LEAs must identify metrics for specific student groups, as appropriate, including expected outcomes that address and reduce disparities in outcomes between student groups.

- The metrics may be quantitative or qualitative; but at minimum, an LEA’s LCAP must include goals that are measured using all of the applicable metrics for the related state priorities, in each LCAP year, as applicable to the type of LEA.

- To the extent a state priority does not specify one or more metrics (e.g., implementation of state academic content and performance standards), the LEA must identify a metric to use within the LCAP. For these state priorities, LEAs are encouraged to use metrics based on or reported through the relevant local indicator self-reflection tools within the Dashboard.

- Required metrics for LEA-wide actions: For each action identified as 1) contributing towards the requirement to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, including long-term English learners, and low-income students and 2) being provided on an LEA-wide basis, the LEA must identify one or more metrics to monitor the effectiveness of the action and its budgeted expenditures.
  - These required metrics may be identified within the action description or the first prompt in the increased or improved services section, however the description must clearly identify the metric(s) being used to monitor the effectiveness of the action and the action(s) that the metric(s) apply to.

- Required metrics for Equity Multiplier goals: For each Equity Multiplier goal, the LEA must identify:
  - The specific metrics for each identified student group at each specific schoolsite, as applicable, to measure the progress toward the goal, and/or
  - The specific metrics used to measure progress in meeting the goal related to credentialing, subject matter preparation, or educator retention at each specific schoolsite.

Complete the table as follows:

Metric #
- Enter the metric number.

Metric
- Identify the standard of measure being used to determine progress towards the goal and/or to measure the effectiveness of one or more actions associated with the goal.

Baseline
- Enter the baseline when completing the LCAP for 2024–25.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 260 c 746
<!-- Page 747 -->
- Use the most recent data associated with the metric available at the time of adoption of the LCAP for the first year of the three-year plan. LEAs may use data as reported on the 2023 Dashboard for the baseline of a metric only if that data represents the most recent available data (e.g., high school graduation rate).

- Using the most recent data available may involve reviewing data the LEA is preparing for submission to the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS) or data that the LEA has recently submitted to CALPADS.

- Indicate the school year to which the baseline data applies.

- The baseline data must remain unchanged throughout the three-year LCAP.
  - This requirement is not intended to prevent LEAs from revising the baseline data if it is necessary to do so. For example, if an LEA identifies that its data collection practices for a particular metric are leading to inaccurate data and revises its practice to obtain accurate data, it would also be appropriate for the LEA to revise the baseline data to align with the more accurate data process and report its results using the accurate data.
  - If an LEA chooses to revise its baseline data, then, at a minimum, it must clearly identify the change as part of its response to the description of changes prompt in the Goal Analysis for the goal. LEAs are also strongly encouraged to involve their educational partners in the decision of whether or not to revise a baseline and to communicate the proposed change to their educational partners.

- Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one- or two-year LCAP may identify a new baseline each year, as applicable.

### Year 1 Outcome
- When completing the LCAP for 2025–26, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies.
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one-year LCAP may provide the Year 1 Outcome when completing the LCAP for both 2025–26 and 2026–27 or may provide the Year 1 Outcome for 2025–26 and provide the Year 2 Outcome for 2026–27.

### Year 2 Outcome
- When completing the LCAP for 2026–27, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies.
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one-year LCAP may identify the Year 2 Outcome as not applicable when completing the LCAP for 2026–27 or may provide the Year 2 Outcome for 2026–27.

### Target for Year 3 Outcome
- When completing the first year of the LCAP, enter the target outcome for the relevant metric the LEA expects to achieve by the end of the three-year LCAP cycle.
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one- or two-year LCAP may identify a Target for Year 1 or Target for Year 2, as applicable.

**Goal Analysis:**

Enter the LCAP Year.

Using actual annual measurable outcome data, including data from the Dashboard, analyze whether the planned actions were effective towards achieving the goal. “Effective” means the degree to which the planned actions were successful in producing the target result. Respond to the prompts as instructed.

**Note:** When completing the 2024–25 LCAP, use the 2023–24 Local Control and Accountability Plan Annual Update template to complete the Goal Analysis and identify the Goal Analysis prompts in the 2024–25 LCAP as “Not Applicable.”

**A description of overall implementation, including any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions, and any relevant challenges and successes experienced with implementation.**

- Describe the overall implementation of the actions to achieve the articulated goal, including relevant challenges and successes experienced with implementation.
  - Include a discussion of relevant challenges and successes experienced with the implementation process.
  - This discussion must include any instance where the LEA did not implement a planned action or implemented a planned action in a manner that differs substantively from how it was described in the adopted LCAP.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.

- Explain material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and between the Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services, as applicable. Minor variances in expenditures or percentages do not need to be addressed, and a dollar-for-dollar accounting is not required.

A description of the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions to date in making progress toward the goal.

- Describe the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions to date in making progress toward the goal. “Effectiveness” means the degree to which the actions were successful in producing the target result and “ineffectiveness” means that the actions did not produce any significant or targeted result.

  - In some cases, not all actions in a goal will be intended to improve performance on all of the metrics associated with the goal.

  - When responding to this prompt, LEAs may assess the effectiveness of a single action or group of actions within the goal in the context of performance on a single metric or group of specific metrics within the goal that are applicable to the action(s). Grouping actions with metrics will allow for more robust analysis of whether the strategy the LEA is using to impact a specified set of metrics is working and increase transparency for educational partners. LEAs are encouraged to use such an approach when goals include multiple actions and metrics that are not closely associated.

  - Beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, target outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

- Describe any changes made to this goal, expected outcomes, metrics, or actions to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis and analysis of the data provided in the Dashboard or other local data, as applicable.

  - As noted above, beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period. For actions that have been identified as ineffective, the LEA must identify the ineffective action and must include a description of the following:

    - The reasons for the ineffectiveness, and

    - How changes to the action will result in a new or strengthened approach.

Actions:  
Complete the table as follows. Add additional rows as necessary.

Action #

![Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students](attachment2.png)

- Professional development for teachers.
  
- If an LEA has both 30 or more English learners and 15 or more long-term English learners, the LEA must include actions for both English learners and long-term English learners.

- LEAs eligible for technical assistance pursuant to EC sections 47607.3, 52071, 52072, or 52072.5, must include specific actions within the LCAP related to its implementation of the work underway as part of technical assistance, frequently referred to as Differentiated Assistance.

- LEAs that have Red Dashboard indicators for (1) a school within the LEA, (2) a student group within the LEA, and/or (3) a student group within any school within the LEA must include one or more specific actions within the LCAP:
  
  - The specific action(s) must be directed towards the identified student group(s) and/or school(s) and must address the identified state indicator(s) for which the student group or school received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard. Each student group and/or school that receives the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard must be addressed by one or more actions.
  
  - These required actions will be effective for the three-year LCAP cycle.

## Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students

### Purpose
A well-written Increased or Improved Services section provides educational partners with a comprehensive description, within a single dedicated section, of how an LEA plans to increase or improve services for its unduplicated students as defined in EC Section 42238.02 in grades TK–12 as compared to all students in grades TK–12, as applicable, and how LEA-wide or schoolwide actions identified for this purpose meet regulatory requirements. Descriptions provided should include sufficient detail yet be sufficiently succinct to promote a broader understanding of educational partners to facilitate their ability to provide input. An LEA’s description in this section must align with the actions included in the Goals and Actions section as contributing.

**Please Note:** For the purpose of meeting the Increased or Improved Services requirement and consistent with EC Section 42238.02, long-term English learners are included in the English learner student group.

### Statutory Requirements
An LEA is required to demonstrate in its LCAP how it is increasing or improving services for its students who are foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income, collectively referred to as unduplicated students, as compared to the services provided to all students in proportion to the increase in funding it receives based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the LEA (EC Section 42238.07[a][1], EC Section 52064[b][8][B]; 5 CCR Section 15496[a]). This proportionality percentage is also known as the “minimum proportionality percentage” or “MPP.” The manner in which an LEA demonstrates it is meeting its MPP is two-fold: (1) through the expenditure of LCFF funds or through the identification of a Planned Percentage of Improved Services as documented in the Contributing Actions Table, and (2) through the explanations provided in the Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students section.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 265 ☐751
<!-- Page 752 -->
![Attachment 2](https://example.com/image.png)

To improve services means to grow services in quality and to increase services means to grow services in quantity. Services are increased or improved by those actions in the LCAP that are identified in the Goals and Actions section as contributing to the increased or improved services requirement, whether they are provided across the entire LEA (LEA-wide action), provided to an entire school (Schoolwide action), or solely provided to one or more unduplicated student group(s) (Limited action).

Therefore, for any action contributing to meet the increased or improved services requirement, the LEA must include an explanation of:

- How the action is increasing or improving services for the unduplicated student group(s) (Identified Needs and Action Design), and
- How the action meets the LEA's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priority areas (Measurement of Effectiveness).

**LEA-wide and Schoolwide Actions**  
In addition to the above required explanations, LEAs must provide a justification for why an LEA-wide or Schoolwide action is being provided to all students and how the action is intended to improve outcomes for unduplicated student group(s) as compared to all students.

- Conclusory statements that a service will help achieve an expected outcome for the goal, without an explicit connection or further explanation as to how, are not sufficient.
- Further, simply stating that an LEA has a high enrollment percentage of a specific student group or groups does not meet the increased or improved services standard because enrolling students is not the same as serving students.

**For School Districts Only**  
Actions provided on an LEA-wide basis at school districts with an unduplicated pupil percentage of less than 55 percent must also include a description of how the actions are the most effective use of the funds to meet the district's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priority areas. The description must provide the basis for this determination, including any alternatives considered, supporting research, experience, or educational theory.

Actions provided on a Schoolwide basis for schools with less than 40 percent enrollment of unduplicated pupils must also include a description of how these actions are the most effective use of the funds to meet the district's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priority areas. The description must provide the basis for this determination, including any alternatives considered, supporting research, experience, or educational theory.

**Requirements and Instructions**  
Complete the tables as follows:

**Total Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants**  
- Specify the amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grant funds the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year based on the number and concentration of foster youth, English learner, and low-income students. This amount includes the Additional 15 percent LCFF Concentration Grant.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 266 c 752
<!-- Page 753 -->
![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+2)

**Projected Additional 15 percent LCFF Concentration Grant**
- Specify the amount of additional LCFF concentration grant add-on funding, as described in EC Section 42238.02, that the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year.

**Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year**
- Specify the estimated percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

**LCFF Carryover — Percentage**
- Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

**LCFF Carryover — Dollar**
- Specify the LCFF Carryover — Dollar amount identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover amount is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify an amount of zero ($0).

**Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year**
- Add the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the Proportional LCFF Required Carryover Percentage and specify the percentage. This is the LEA’s percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year, as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

**Required Descriptions:**
**LEA-wide and Schoolwide Actions**
For each action being provided to an entire LEA or school, provide an explanation of (1) the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed, (2) how the action is designed to address the identified need(s) and why it is being provided on an LEA or schoolwide basis, and (3) the metric(s) used to measure the effectiveness of the action in improving outcomes for the unduplicated student group(s).

If the LEA has provided this required description in the Action Descriptions, state as such within the table.

**Complete the table as follows:**

**Identified Need(s)**
Provide an explanation of the unique identified need(s) of the LEA’s unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed.

![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+2)

An LEA demonstrates how an action is principally directed towards an unduplicated student group(s) when the LEA explains the need(s), condition(s), or circumstance(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) identified through a needs assessment and how the action addresses them. A meaningful needs assessment includes, at a minimum, analysis of applicable student achievement data and educational partner feedback.

## How the Action(s) are Designed to Address Need(s) and Why it is Provided on an LEA-wide or Schoolwide Basis
Provide an explanation of how the action as designed will address the unique identified need(s) of the LEA’s unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed and the rationale for why the action is being provided on an LEA-wide or schoolwide basis.
- As stated above, conclusory statements that a service will help achieve an expected outcome for the goal, without an explicit connection or further explanation as to how, are not sufficient.
- Further, simply stating that an LEA has a high enrollment percentage of a specific student group or groups does not meet the increased or improved services standard because enrolling students is not the same as serving students.

## Metric(s) to Monitor Effectiveness
Identify the metric(s) being used to measure the progress and effectiveness of the action(s).

**Note for COEs and Charter Schools:** In the case of COEs and charter schools, schoolwide and LEA-wide are considered to be synonymous.

## Limited Actions
For each action being solely provided to one or more unduplicated student group(s), provide an explanation of (1) the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served, (2) how the action is designed to address the identified need(s), and (3) how the effectiveness of the action in improving outcomes for the unduplicated student group(s) will be measured.

If the LEA has provided the required descriptions in the Action Descriptions, state as such.

### Complete the table as follows:

**Identified Need(s)**
Provide an explanation of the unique need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served identified through the LEA’s needs assessment. A meaningful needs assessment includes, at a minimum, analysis of applicable student achievement data and educational partner feedback.

**How the Action(s) are Designed to Address Need(s)**
Provide an explanation of how the action is designed to address the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served.

## Metric(s) to Monitor Effectiveness

**Identify the metric(s) being used to measure the progress and effectiveness of the action(s).**

For any limited action contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement that is associated with a Planned Percentage of Improved Services in the Contributing Summary Table rather than an expenditure of LCFF funds, describe the methodology that was used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage, as applicable.

- For each action with an identified Planned Percentage of Improved Services, identify the goal and action number and describe the methodology that was used.
  
- When identifying a Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA must describe the methodology that it used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. The percentage of improved services for an action corresponds to the amount of LCFF funding that the LEA estimates it would expend to implement the action if it were funded.

- For example, an LEA determines that there is a need to analyze data to ensure that instructional aides and expanded learning providers know what targeted supports to provide to students who are foster youth. The LEA could implement this action by hiring additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students, which, based on the LEA’s current pay scale, the LEA estimates would cost $165,000. Instead, the LEA chooses to utilize a portion of existing staff time to analyze data relating to students who are foster youth. This analysis will then be shared with site principals who will use the data to coordinate services provided by instructional assistants and expanded learning providers to target support to students. In this example, the LEA would divide the estimated cost of $165,000 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Total Planned Expenditures Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Planned Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

## Additional Concentration Grant Funding

A description of the plan for how the additional concentration grant add-on funding identified above will be used to increase the number of staff providing direct services to students at schools that have a high concentration (above 55 percent) of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students, as applicable.

An LEA that receives the additional concentration grant add-on described in EC Section 42238.02 is required to demonstrate how it is using these funds to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is equal to or less than 55 percent. The staff who provide direct services to students must be certificated staff and/or classified staff employed by the LEA; classified staff includes custodial staff.

**Provide the following descriptions, as applicable to the LEA:**

- An LEA that does not receive a concentration grant or the concentration grant add-on must indicate that a response to this prompt is not applicable.

- Identify the goal and action numbers of the actions in the LCAP that the LEA is implementing to meet the requirement to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

Page 269 c 755
<!-- Page 756 -->
![Attachment 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Attachment+2)

- An LEA that does not have comparison schools from which to describe how it is using the concentration grant add-on funds, such as a single-school LEA or an LEA that only has schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, must describe how it is using the funds to increase the number of credential staff, classified staff, or both, including custodial staff, who provide direct services to students at selected schools and the criteria used to determine which schools require additional staffing support.

- In the event that an additional concentration grant add-on is not sufficient to increase staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, the LEA must describe how it is using the funds to retain staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

Complete the table as follows:

- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA.

  - The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA.
  
  - The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.

- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA.

  - The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA.
  
  - The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of FTE staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.

**Action Tables**  
Complete the Total Planned Expenditures Table for each action in the LCAP. The information entered into this table will automatically populate the other Action Tables. Information is only entered into the Total Planned Expenditures Table, the Annual Update Table, the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, and the LCFF Carryover Table. The word “input” has been added to column headers to aid in identifying the column(s) where information will be entered. Information is not entered on the remaining Action tables.

The following tables are required to be included as part of the LCAP adopted by the local governing board or governing body:

- Table 4: Contributing Actions Annual Update Table (for the current LCAP Year)
- Table 5: LCFF Carryover Table (for the current LCAP Year)

Note: The coming LCAP Year is the year that is being planned for, while the current LCAP year is the current year of implementation. For example, when developing the 2024–25 LCAP, 2024–25 will be the coming LCAP Year and 2023–24 will be the current LCAP Year.

## Total Planned Expenditures Table
In the Total Planned Expenditures Table, input the following information for each action in the LCAP for that applicable LCAP year:

- **LCAP Year**: Identify the applicable LCAP Year.

1. **Projected LCFF Base Grant**: Provide the total amount estimated LCFF entitlement for the coming school year, excluding the supplemental and concentration grants and the add-ons for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant program, the former Home-to-School Transportation program, and the Small School District Transportation program, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). Note that the LCFF Base Grant for purposes of the LCAP also includes the Necessary Small Schools and Economic Recovery Target allowances for school districts, and County Operations Grant for COEs.

   See EC sections 2574 (for COEs) and 42238.02 (for school districts and charter schools), as applicable, for LCFF entitlement calculations.

2. **Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants**: Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants estimated on the basis of the number and concentration of unduplicated students for the coming school year.

3. **Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year**: This percentage will not be entered; it is calculated based on the Projected LCFF Base Grant and the Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the coming LCAP year.

- **LCFF Carryover — Percentage**: Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table from the prior LCAP year. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

- **Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year**: This percentage will not be entered; it is calculated based on the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the LCFF Carryover — Percentage. 

This is the percentage by which the LEA must increase or improve services for unduplicated pupils as compared to the services provided to all students in the coming LCAP year.

An action that is LEA-wide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of the LEA. An action that is schoolwide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of a single school. An action that is limited in its scope is an action that serves only one or more unduplicated student groups.
  - **Unduplicated Student Group(s):** Regardless of scope, contributing actions serve one or more unduplicated student groups. Indicate one or more unduplicated student groups for whom services are being increased or improved as compared to what all students receive.
  - **Location:** Identify the location where the action will be provided. If the action is provided to all schools within the LEA, the LEA must indicate “All Schools.” If the action is provided to specific schools within the LEA or specific grade spans only, the LEA must enter “Specific Schools” or “Specific Grade Spans.” Identify the individual school or a subset of schools or grade spans (e.g., all high schools or grades transitional kindergarten through grade five), as appropriate.
- **Time Span:** Enter “ongoing” if the action will be implemented for an indeterminate period of time. Otherwise, indicate the span of time for which the action will be implemented. For example, an LEA might enter “1 Year,” or “2 Years,” or “6 Months.”
- **Total Personnel:** Enter the total amount of personnel expenditures utilized to implement this action.
- **Total Non-Personnel:** This amount will be automatically calculated based on information provided in the Total Personnel column and the Total Funds column.
- **LCFF Funds:** Enter the total amount of LCFF funds utilized to implement this action, if any. LCFF funds include all funds that make up an LEA’s total LCFF target (i.e., base grant, grade span adjustment, supplemental grant, concentration grant, Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant, and Home-To-School Transportation).

- **Other State Funds**: Enter the total amount of Other State Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.
  - **Note**: Equity Multiplier funds must be included in the “Other State Funds” category, not in the “LCFF Funds” category. As a reminder, Equity Multiplier funds must be used to supplement, not supplant, funding provided to Equity Multiplier schools for purposes of the LCFF, the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP. This means that Equity Multiplier funds must not be used to replace funding that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement LEA-wide actions identified in the LEA’s LCAP or that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement provisions of the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP.

- **Local Funds**: Enter the total amount of Local Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

- **Federal Funds**: Enter the total amount of Federal Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

- **Total Funds**: This amount is automatically calculated based on amounts entered in the previous four columns.

- **Planned Percentage of Improved Services**: For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the planned quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%). A limited action is an action that only serves foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income students.
  - **Note**: As noted in the instructions for the Increased or Improved Services section, when identifying a Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA must describe the methodology that is used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. The percentage of improved services for an action corresponds to the amount of LCFF funding that the LEA estimates it would expend to implement the action if it were funded.

  For example, an LEA determines that there is a need to analyze data to ensure that instructional aides and expanded learning providers know what targeted supports to provide to students who are foster youth. The LEA could implement this action by hiring additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students, which, based on the LEA’s current pay scale, the LEA estimates would cost $165,000. Instead, the LEA chooses to utilize a portion of existing staff time to analyze data relating to students who are foster youth. This analysis will then be shared with site principals who will use the data to coordinate services provided by instructional assistants and expanded learning providers to target support to students. In this example, the LEA would divide the estimated cost of $165,000 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Planned Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

As noted above, information will not be entered in the Contributing Actions Table; however, the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column will need to be checked to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses.

## Annual Update Table
In the Annual Update Table, provide the following information for each action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditures to implement this action, if any.

## Contributing Actions Annual Update Table
In the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, check the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses. Provide the following information for each contributing action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

6. **Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants:** Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants estimated based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the current school year.

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditure of LCFF funds used to implement this action, if any.

- **Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services:** For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis only to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the total estimated actual quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%).

  - Building on the example provided above for calculating the Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA in the example implements the action. As part of the annual update process, the LEA reviews implementation and student outcome data and determines that the action was implemented with fidelity and that outcomes for foster youth students improved. The LEA reviews the original estimated cost for the action and determines that had it hired additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students that estimated actual cost would have been $169,500 due to a cost of living adjustment. The LEA would divide the estimated actual cost of $169,500 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

## LCFF Carryover Table
9. **Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant:** Provide the total amount of estimated LCFF Target Entitlement for the current school year, excluding the supplemental and concentration grants and the add-ons for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant program, the former Home-to-School Transportation program, and the Small School District Transportation program, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). Note that the LCFF Base Grant for purposes of the LCAP also includes the Necessary Small Schools and Economic.

Recovery Target allowances for school districts, and County Operations Grant for COEs. See EC sections 2574 (for COEs) and 42238.02 (for school districts and charter schools), as applicable, for LCFF entitlement calculations.

- **10. Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Current School Year:** This percentage will not be entered. The percentage is calculated based on the amounts of the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9) and the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants (6), pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8), plus the LCFF Carryover – Percentage from the prior year. This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the current LCAP year.

## Calculations in the Action Tables
To reduce the duplication of effort of LEAs, the Action Tables include functionality such as pre-population of fields and cells based on the information provided in the Data Entry Table, the Annual Update Summary Table, and the Contributing Actions Table. For transparency, the functionality and calculations used are provided below.

### Contributing Actions Table
- **4. Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (LCFF Funds)**
  - This amount is the total of the Planned Expenditures for Contributing Actions (LCFF Funds) column.

- **5. Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services**
  - This percentage is the total of the Planned Percentage of Improved Services column.

- **Planned Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the coming school year (4 divided by 1, plus 5)**
  - This percentage is calculated by dividing the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) by the Projected LCFF Base Grant (1), converting the quotient to a percentage, and adding it to the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5).

### Contributing Actions Annual Update Table
Pursuant to EC Section 42238.07(c)(2), if the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) is less than the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants (6), the LEA is required to calculate the difference between the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5) and the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (7). If the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) is equal to or greater than the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants (6), the Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services will display “Not Required.”

- **6. Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants**
  - This is the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants the LEA estimates it will actually receive based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the current school year.

- **Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (Subtract 5 from 8)**
  - This amount is the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5) subtracted from the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (8).

**LCFF Carryover Table**
- **10. Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Current School Year (6 divided by 9 plus Carryover %)**
  - This percentage is the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants (6) divided by the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9) plus the LCFF Carryover – Percentage from the prior year.

- **11. Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (7 divided by 9, plus 8)**
  - This percentage is the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (7) divided by the LCFF Funding (9), then converting the quotient to a percentage and adding the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (8).

- **12. LCFF Carryover — Dollar Amount LCFF Carryover (Subtract 11 from 10 and multiply by 9)**
  - If the Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (11) is less than the Estimated Actual Percentage to Increase or Improve Services (10), the LEA is required to carry over LCFF funds.

![2023-24 LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN (LCAP) EDUCATIONAL PARTNER ENGAGEMENT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=2023-24+LOCAL+CONTROL+AND+ACCOUNTABILITY+PLAN+%28LCAP%29+EDUCATIONAL+PARTNER+ENGAGEMENT)

The Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) is a three-year plan that is revised annually that addresses the state priority areas, includes the diverse perspectives of our educational partners, and describes how services are provided to improve student performance with an emphasis on English learner, low income, and foster youth students.

State priority areas include:
- **Student Achievement and Implementation of State Standards** - Improve achievement and outcomes for all students as measured by performance on statewide assessments, English proficiency, and college and career preparedness.
- **Student Engagement and Course Access** - Provide students with engaging programs, course work, and opportunities that address attendance, dropout, graduation, and access to a broad course of study.
- **School Conditions, Climate, and Family Engagement** - Address factors both inside and outside the classroom that impact student success such as family engagement, health, safety, discipline, connectedness, facilities, materials, and staffing.

Out educational partners include students, families, staff, and community members. A total of 3,337 educational partners were engaged using various outreach and communication strategies to differentiate our approach and maximize participation especially for our priority student groups. These strategies included:
- Thought Exchanges, listening sessions, focus groups, and surveys
- Meeting with partners in 1:1, group, online, and in person settings
- Communicating with our educational partners via website, mass notification, social media, community newsletters, and targeted outreach

Educational partners were asked to consider what our schools are doing well and what our schools can do differently to improve support for students and families. Input was then reviewed within and across groups for common themes to identify both districtwide and student group specific needs.

Collectively, the eight state priority areas, LCAP metrics, and educational partner input were analyzed and used to revise existing LCAP actions, develop new actions, and allocate funds strategically to reflect the voice and needs of our entire San Juan community.

| 1  | DELAC     | It is a significant recognition to be reclassified and families appreciate this recognition. The majority of families do not know about the reclassification process.                                   | Translated letters informing parents of the reclassification process are sent annually. We will include reclassification as a topic for DELAC and encourage school sites that are not already doing so to add the reclassification process to their ELAC agendas. Additionally, we have identified that a lack of awareness and communication about the reclassification process is an area of improvement. In response to this identified need, LCAP Action 1.25 focuses on increasing the number of students, families, and staff who understand the English Language Development (ELD) process, purpose, pathways, and options.                                                                 |

|   | How many schools post their School Site Council (SSC) meeting calendar on their school website? |
|   | How many schools post their School Site Council (SSC) minutes of their meeting on their school website? |
|   | How many schools post their School Site Council (SSC) representatives on their school website? |
|   | While not a requirement, sites are encouraged to post SSC calendar and minutes on their websites. Historically, School Site Council (SSC) minutes have been available upon request to accommodate translation. Inclusion of information on SSC is part of the standard website template, however specific information posted will vary by site. For example, some sites choose to share information via their school newsletter. Information about School Site Councils and SPSAs are publicly available on the district and school website. |

|   | How is mindfulness incorporated in the LCAP as a proactive measure versus crisis response? |
|   | The practitioners who are funded in LCAP such as counselors, school social workers, and mental health therapists often incorporate mindfulness in their work with students and staff. Professional learning opportunities have been made available to staff to develop an understanding of mindful practices that can be embedded in their daily practice. |

|   | Is there funding to support safe biking and walking to school such as crossing guards? Safety has come up in multiple meetings, including at Board of Education meetings as public comments. |
|   | The district has employed a Safe Routes to School staff member through the use of grant funds. This position has engaged in activities such as walk audits to determine best paths of travel to and from schools, bike rodeos to teach safe biking skills to students, traffic advisement to address concerns or when new modernization projects are undertaken. The grant funding for this position expires with the 2023/24 school year and we are assessing how to incorporate these activities and skill sets into the larger Safe Schools team. Additionally, staff are currently exploring the possibility of a crossing guard program. |

6 LCAP PAC  
Where can we see data on:  
- How many physical fights have occurred at each school?  
- How many incidents of sexual violence have occurred at each school?  
- How many incidents of substance abuse have occurred at each school?  
- How many total incidents have occurred at each school?  

See question #6 attachment.  
Data from the district’s Incident Response & Information System (IRIS) is being provided. It is important to note that this data represents incidents that caused significant disruption to a school environment. Other incidents that had less impact may only be reported in individual student records and would not be represented here. Additionally, the system does not categorize incidents matching each description requested, so staff have attempted to report the most appropriate data sets possible.

7 LCAP PAC  
The district is doing great at reaching out to the community to invite their participation in various things such as Strategic Planning, dress code policy, and district committees. Has this expanded outreach resulted in increased participation?  

When considering total participation, it would be difficult to make comparisons as response rates vary based on a number of factors and are largely driven by the perceived level of importance or impact to participants.  
What can be demonstrated is that recent outreach efforts have resulted in greater participation across groups. For example, many recent efforts have included strategies such as direct presentations to district committees helping ensure their participation and diversity of voice in the conversation. Other strategies such as focus groups have yielded greater representation from traditionally underrepresented groups.

SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  
BOARD OF EDUCATION  

AGENDA ITEM: 1.3  
MEETING DATE: 06/25/2024  

**SUBJECT:** San Juan Choices Charter School Dashboard: Local Indicators (Ginter) – 7:45 p.m.  

**DEPARTMENT:** Teaching and Learning  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Report regarding the San Juan Choices Charter School’s measurement of progress for the five local indicators related to the state accountability dashboard.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
In 2013, the state adopted the Local Control Funding Formula and initiated development of district Local Control and Accountability Plans (LCAP). This laid the groundwork for a new accountability system which reports Local Education Agency (LEA) results on the state’s eight state priority areas. This accountability system uses a combination of state-reported measures and local measures to report on the eight priorities. Using the approved state standards for the local indicators, LEAs must annually measure and report their progress at a regularly scheduled public meeting of the local governing board. Tonight, results from local measures will be presented for priority one (basic services), priority two (state standards implementation), priority three (parent engagement), priority six (school climate), and priority seven (broad course of study). All the measures refer to data already presented to and discussed by the board. After the meeting, results will be uploaded and will be publicly reported through the state’s accountability dashboard upon its release this fall.

# LCFF Budget Overview for Parents

The LCFF gives school districts more flexibility in deciding how to use state funds. In exchange, school districts must work with parents, educators, students, and the community to develop a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) that shows how they will use these funds to serve students.

![Budgeted Expenditures in the LCAP](chart_image_url)

Of that amount, $933,438 is tied to actions/services in the LCAP and $2,284,165 is not included in the LCAP. The budgeted expenditures that are not included in the LCAP will be used for the following:

- Unrestricted operational costs such as personnel, facility lease costs, utilities, property and liability insurance, contribution to SJUSD for central services, and technology purchased with restricted grant funds.

## Increased or Improved Services for High Needs Students in the LCAP for the 2024-25 School Year

# Update on Increased or Improved Services for High Needs Students in 2023-24

## Prior Year Expenditures: Increased or Improved Services for High Needs Students

|   | Total Budgeted Expenditures for High Needs Students in the LCAP | Actual Expenditures for High Needs Students in LCAP |
|---|---|---|
|   | $520,574 | $431,074 |

This chart compares what San Juan Choices Charter School budgeted last year in the LCAP for actions and services that contribute to increasing or improving services for high needs students with what San Juan Choices Charter School estimates it has spent on actions and services that contribute to increasing or improving services for high needs students in the current year.

The text description of the above chart is as follows: In 2023-24, San Juan Choices Charter School's LCAP budgeted $520,574 for planned actions to increase or improve services for high needs students. San Juan Choices Charter School actually spent $431,074 for actions to increase or improve services for high needs students in 2023-24.

The difference between the budgeted and actual expenditures of -$89,500 had the following impact on San Juan Choices Charter School’s ability to increase or improve services for high needs students:

In 2023-24, some of our planned expenditures and actions were accomplished using grant funds. Other action items took longer than anticipated to research and design and were postponed for implementation until the 2024-25 school year. We also experienced delays due to our WASC accreditation review which required a significant investment in time and personnel.

# Goal Analysis

An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

## Actions/Services Not Implemented as Planned:

Due to evolving resources and perspectives, the following planned LCAP services were offered in a different format or paused in 2023-24:

### Tutoring:
Creation and maintenance of online tutoring schedule where students reserve one-on-one tutoring sessions in specific subject areas with specific faculty members (10 Director hours per year + 2 Community Outreach Worker hours per week + 10 Faculty hours per week)
- Some research was conducted on this topic, but the launch of the online tutoring schedule was postponed to Fall 2024.

### College & Career Planning Support:
Develop a second CTE Pathway in Public Services / Public Safety or Arts, Media, & Entertainment. (4 Faculty hours per week)
- This activity was postponed to 2024-25.

Host on-campus speakers who will share information about their professions and the entrance requirements in their fields. Posters about guest speakers to be featured around the school. (40 Community Liaison hours per year)
- Two guest speakers were hosted during College & Career Week; due to low student attendance, the series planned for the remainder of the year was tabled.

Provide at least ten off-campus graduation- and college/career-oriented field trips available to high school students each year. This includes, but is not limited to, Sacramento Speaker Series events, the SJUSD College Fair, CSU Sacramento College Fair, college visits (American River College, CSU Sacramento, UC Davis), and Grad Night. Field trips to colleges/universities include visits to the Disabilities Services and Programs for Students (DSPS) and Financial Aid offices when possible. (60 Faculty hours per year + 60 Counselor hours per year)
- Field trips to colleges/universities were postponed to 2024-25. However, ten field trips were offered, including the addition of a trip to SJUSD's Historically Black Colleges & Universities Recruitment Fair.
<!-- Page 857 -->
Community Enhancements:

Provide at least one grade-specific field trip each year in grades 6, 7 & 8. (30 Faculty hours per year)  
• Just one field trip in sixth grade was offered in 2023-24 due to resource constraints. An all-grades bowling field trip included both middle and high school students.

Virtual Reality Science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics) Labs (2 Faculty hours per week + cost of curriculum)  
• This activity was postponed to 2024 due to resource constraints.

Create and implement rewards systems to acknowledge students’ academic progress, as well as to celebrate growth and strong character, throughout the school year (1 Director hour per week + 1 Administrative Assistant hour per week + 3 Faculty hours per week)  
• This activity was postponed to 2024-25.

Technology Resources:

No substantive differences.

Miscellaneous Support:

Continue to provide intervention services for students who struggle academically and/or socially. Advisory Teachers implement a new official intervention process at the close of each log period. (18 Community Liaison hours per week + 18 Counselor hours per week +9 Assistant Director hours per week + 40 Faculty hours per week)  
• Though some progress in this area was made, more progress is needed in 2024-25 for consistent implementation of a formalized process.

Provide four in-person, evening training sessions for parents: use of School Pathways, PLP, and best practices for supporting an independent study student. (40 Director hours per year)  
• These activities were tabled due to and anticipated low attendance rate.

Build an email message template and demonstration video that teachers and Community Outreach Worker can use to teach parents how to use PLP effectively. (5 Director hours + 5 Assistant Director hours + 5 Community Liaison hours per year)  
• This activity was postponed to 2024-25.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services.

In 2023-24, due largely to the demands associated with addressing a full WASC accreditation review, fewer than anticipated new activities were implemented with the use of LCFF funds. However, most LCAP activities were executed as planned, and estimated actual expenditures remained well above 2023-24 LCFF requirements.

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.

No data is yet available for the 2023-24 school year. However, given that most of the actions/services that Choices provided in 2023-24 are the same or very similar to those provided in recent previous years, data from 2020-23 provides some direction in evaluating the effectiveness of CCS’s efforts to provide student services in an equitable manner. Some data types have been unavailable in recent years, and data for English Learners and Foster Youth are often not published due to insufficient sample sizes. However, the data that is available is largely positive:

- **Graduation Rate:** The Graduation Rates of All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students grew in 2020, 2021, and 2022 and then settled slightly in 2023. The Graduation Rates of each group have remained nearly equal or equal (2022) to one another, demonstrating equity of the Choices Charter program. Slightly more than half (52%) of 2023 graduates stated that they would not have graduated from high school had they not enrolled at Choices.

- **CAASPP (ELA SBA, Math SBA, and Science CAST):** In 2023, Choices students exceeded state proficiency rates in Science and, for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, in ELA. All student groups lagged behind the state in Math for a second consecutive year. In ELA and Math, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students scored as well as All Students, but English Learners lagged significantly behind. In Science, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students lagged behind All Students only slightly, and English Learners scored significantly ahead of All Students.

In 2023, when CAASPP scores were not as strong as they previously were, CAASPP Student Survey results revealed that 70% of the students who took the CAASPP exams had been enrolled at Choices for less than one school year. In fact, 56% of testers had enrolled in the same semester that the tests were administered. Both figures were at an all-time high in 2023 and far exceeded the previous years’ figures when approximately half of tested students had been enrolled at Choices for less than a year (approximately 30% enrolling during the semester of testing). This suggests that test scores in 2023 were largely a reflection of the education that students received at their previous schools.

**College Career Indicator:** The College Career Indicator (“CCI”) for both All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students grew in 2020. Both student groups experienced drops when the CCI was published again in 2023 after a three-year hiatus. Nearly three-fourths
<!-- Page 859 -->

(73%) of 2023 graduates planned to immediately enroll in colleges or trade schools, and nearly all (91%) of 2023 graduates felt prepared for college and a career.

Thanks to a growing focus on Choices’ college and career readiness opportunities, such as A-G courses, co-enrollment at community colleges, a Career Technical Education Pathway in Business & Finance, and two World Language tracks that lead to biliteracy, more Choices students are expected to be considered “Prepared” for college and career each year.

Chronic Absenteeism: No Chronic Absenteeism (grades 6-8) data for English Learners was available in years 2020-2023. For Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, achievement gaps grew in 2021 and remained steady through 2023.

The LCAP Actions associated with Goal 1 were successful as demonstrated in 2023 by equity in Graduation Rates and academic proficiency levels on CAASPP for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students in ELA, Math, and Science, and for English Learners in Science. The Actions may be deemed as unsuccessful in that the achievement gaps between Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students and All Students on the College/Career Indicator and with Chronic Absenteeism rates have not been reduced in recent years.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

In 2024-25, Choices Charter School's LCAP goals will be substantially redesigned to align with those of its chartering school district, San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD). Educational partners will provide feedback based on LCAP metrics data that will inform decisions about which actions will remain and which will be discontinued in the coming year. Choices will seek to include more locally collected data points to use as additional metrics that may more accurately reflect student progress at Choices.

A report of the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for last year’s actions may be found in the Annual Update Table. A report of the Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services for last year’s actions may be found in the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table.

## Goal Analysis
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year. A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

- **Identify, Support, and Track Progress of Students with Anxiety**  
  No substantive differences.

- **Mental Health Support for Students**  
  No substantive differences.

All planned actions/services were implemented for Goal 2 in 2023-24. No new actions/services were added to this goal in 2023-24.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.

There were no material differences between planned and actual services or expenditures for Goal 2 in 2023-24.

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.

- **Students with Disabilities Attitude Survey:** The percentage of Students with Disabilities who believed that their anxiety levels had dropped since enrolling at Choices dropped in 2022 and then grew again in 2023 but not enough to reach desired outcomes.

- **Student School Satisfaction Survey:** The percentage of All Students who believed that their anxiety levels had dropped since enrolling at Choices dropped in 2021 and then grew again in 2022 and 2023 but not enough to reach desired outcomes. The percentage of students who reported that they feel safe on campus grew in 2021, plateaued in 2022, and then dropped slightly in 2023; in all years, the desired outcome percentage was achieved.

![2024 LCAP Annual Update for the 2023-24 LCAP for San Juan Choices Charter School](https://example.com/image.png)

The Choices Charter School LCAP’s Goal 2 Actions may be deemed effective in that nearly all students (98%) felt safe on campus in 2023, and because this percentage is so high, it is safe to deduce that it includes nearly all Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, English Learners, and Foster Youth at Choices. While anxiety levels did not drop at Choices as much as hoped during and immediately following the COVID-19 campus closure, the percentages of All Students and Students with Disabilities surveyed in 2023 who felt that their anxiety levels had dropped since enrolling at Choices grew. It is believed that the pandemic further destabilized students, preventing Choices from reaching the objectives it originally set regarding anxiety levels by 2023. 2024 Students with Disabilities Attitude Survey data and Student School Satisfaction Survey data may show growth that will equal or surpass the ultimate desired outcomes.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

In 2024-25, Choices Charter School's LCAP goals will be substantially redesigned to align with those of its chartering school district, San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD). Educational partners will provide feedback based on LCAP metrics data that will inform decisions about which actions will remain and which will be discontinued in the coming year.

**Goal Analysis**

Using actual annual measurable outcome data, including data from the Dashboard, analyze whether the planned actions were effective in achieving the goal. Respond to the prompts as instructed.

- **A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.**
  - Describe the overall implementation of the actions to achieve the articulated goal. Include a discussion of relevant challenges and successes experienced with the implementation process. This must include any instance where the LEA did not implement a planned action or implemented a planned action in a manner that differs substantively from how it was described in the adopted LCAP.

- **An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.**
  - Explain material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and between the Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services, as applicable. Minor variances in expenditures or percentages do not need to be addressed, and a dollar-for-dollar accounting is not required.

- **An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.**
  - Describe the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle. “Effectiveness” means the degree to which the actions were successful in producing the desired result and “ineffectiveness” means that the actions did not produce any significant or desired result.
    - In some cases, not all actions in a goal will be intended to improve performance on all of the metrics associated with the goal.
      - When responding to this prompt, LEAs may assess the effectiveness of a single action or group of actions within the goal in the context of performance on a single metric or group of specific metrics within the goal that are applicable to the action(s).
      - Grouping actions with metrics will allow for more robust analysis of whether the strategy the LEA is using to impact a specified set of metrics is working and increase transparency for educational partners. LEAs are encouraged to use such an approach when goals include multiple actions and metrics that are not closely associated.
      - Beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period.

- **A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.**
  - Describe any changes made to this goal, expected outcomes, metrics, or actions to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis and analysis of the data provided in the Dashboard or other local data, as applicable.
    - As noted above, beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period. For actions that have been identified as ineffective, the LEA must identify the ineffective action and must include a description of the following:
      - The reasons for the ineffectiveness, and
      - How changes to the action will result in a new or strengthened approach.

## Plan Summary [2024-25]

### General Information
A description of the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades transitional kindergarten–12, as applicable to the LEA.

Choices Charter School (CCS or Choices) is a 6-12 Independent Study School that involves parents/guardians as partners in the education of their children. A highly-qualified and dedicated faculty educates a diverse population of students. Choices serves students effectively with its flexible, personalized learning model and the safety that a small, nurturing learning community provides.

Students typically enroll at Choices because the traditional school model does not fit their needs. Students often want a greater sense of control over their education, prefer a smaller learning environment, struggle with overwhelming family challenges and responsibilities, have experienced undesirable social dynamics in a traditional school program, wish to graduate early or catch up on credits that they lack, or face health challenges. Some students are busy on weekdays cultivating a special skill or working. Choices staff members meet students where they are academically and seek to provide educational opportunities that challenge them appropriately, resulting in successes that build confidence and motivation. Students typically feel respected and “seen” at Choices and become more engaged in their education, as a result.

All Choices students utilize online curriculum that is aligned with California Content Standards and Common Core Standards and is available 24 hours a day. Student attendance is defined by the completion of assigned work; attendance on campus is not required. However, many students enjoy learning in person, too, and Choices provides onsite support classes to address this need. The Choices program is highly customizable. Some students may choose to follow a “pure” independent study format that involves no attendance in in-person instructional settings. Others may choose to follow a hybrid learning option that involves one-to-two hours of in-person, on-campus instruction per course, per week. Still others may choose to define their own plan that blends the two models, perhaps, for example, attending class for a few courses and learning online-only for others. Those who do attend in-person support classes experience individualized support, meaningful relationships with faculty, social interaction with peers, and collaborative learning that enhances the curriculum available to them online.

Choices students benefit from A-G coursework, a CTE Pathway in Business & Finance, AP and Honors courses, a choice of two World Languages, the opportunity to enroll in community college courses, a wide variety of engaging elective classes, designated curriculum for
<!-- Page 867 -->

English Learners, a robust Special Education Department, college & career assignments and campus activities, college counseling, extracurricular activities and field trips, access to community internships, onsite mental health counseling, technology and technical support, a school Honor Roll, character awards, academic awards, and scholarships. All Choices students may seek supplemental support from on-campus tutors and teachers who are available to help students each school day, either in person or via an online video communication tool.

Founded in 1999, the school’s charter was renewed in 2004, 2009, 2014, and 2019 for five-year terms. A three-year extension on CCS’s charter was granted due to the COVID-19 pandemic; Choices’ charter will now be eligible for renewal in 2027. Choices is currently WASC-Accredited through June 2030.

## Reflections: Annual Performance
A reflection on annual performance based on a review of the California School Dashboard (Dashboard) and local data.

Though 2024 data is not yet available, Choices Charter School is proud of its students’ progress in academic achievement, college and career readiness, and emotional well-being, which is demonstrated by data from 2023 and previous recent years. Due to small sample sizes, to protect the privacy of individual students, data results for English Learners (6%) and Foster Youth (2%) are typically not reported publicly; most data highlighted here focuses on the successes of All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students (54%).

- **Graduation Rate:** Many students enroll at CCS deficient in credits, due to difficulties at their previous schools, and often need an extra semester or year to finish high school. At Choices, most students can recover their credits and continue to graduation in five years or less. The Graduation Rate climbed steadily for All Students and for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students between 2019 and 2022 and then settled slightly in 2023. The Graduation Rates for each student group are nearly equal or to one another in each year, indicating that all students are served equitably at Choices.

- **Academic Achievement:** (CAASPP ELA SBA, Math SBA, and Science CAST: CAASPP Student Survey; i-Ready): In 2021, Choices students performed very well on the SBA and CAST, exceeding state proficiency rates in nearly all categories. Disadvantaged student subgroups also exceeded proficiency of All Students in almost all categories. Significant gains in proficiency by all student groups in 2021 seemed to suggest that modified, shorter SBA exams given in 2021 were less challenging than the standard version that was administered in 2019. However, State of California data shows that students of all subgroups experienced declines in performance, on average, across the state in 2021. In fact, Choices Students not only improved in 2021; they significantly outperformed the state proficiency rates in nearly all categories. Choices students may have fared better than most students in the state, due to consistency in curriculum and instruction and dedicated outreach to families throughout 2020 and 2021. Whereas traditional schools often struggled to adjust to distance learning conditions, Choices was able to transition nearly seamlessly. In 2022, Choices students continued to exceed state proficiency rates in ELA and nearly all student group categories in Science. All student groups lagged behind the state in Math, however. In most cases, disadvantaged student subgroups lagged behind All Students in proficiency rates. In 2023, Choices students exceeded state proficiency rates in Science and, for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, in ELA. All student groups lagged behind the state in Math for a second consecutive year. In ELA and

Math, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students scored as well as All Students, but English Learners lagged significantly behind. In Science, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students lagged behind All Students only slightly, and English Learners scored significantly ahead of All Students. SBA and CAST performance and achievement gaps between All Students and disadvantaged student subgroups have fluctuated over time. Due to small sample sizes, statistics often change significantly from year to year. Multiple years of data are studied to identify trends. The data above seems to suggest that distance learning significantly benefited Choices students - especially in Math - and was particularly effective at educating Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, as well as English Learners. Though Choices takes its standardized test scores very seriously, we also must remember that they are not necessarily a strong indicator of the strength of the Choices program. For example, in 2023, when CAASPP scores were not as strong as they previously were, CAASPP Student Survey results revealed that 70% of the students who took the CAASPP exams had been enrolled at Choices for less than one school year. In fact, 56% of testers had enrolled in the same semester that the tests were administered. Both figures were at an all-time high in 2023, and far exceeded the previous years’ figures when approximately half of tested students had been enrolled at Choices for less than a year (approximately 30% enrolling during the semester of testing). This suggests that test scores in 2023 were largely a reflection of the education that students received at their previous schools. Fall 2022 i-Ready data demonstrated that, when students are continuously enrolled for even just one semester, they experience significant growth in Math and stabilization or moderate growth in ELA.

- **College & Career Readiness (College Career Indicator, Student School Satisfaction Survey, Students with Disabilities Attitude Survey, Senior Exit Survey):** Many students enrolled at CCS behind in high school course credits and/or unsure about their futures. While at Choices, students are supported in their coursework, offered credit recovery classes, and encouraged to explore electives and extracurricular activities that may spark interests and provide direction. Students are encouraged to consider and prepare for college and career through Graduation Outcomes focused on high school graduation and post-secondary goals, annual College & Career Week activities, college/career assignments in each class, field trips, a CTE Pathway in Business & Finance, grade-level classroom presentations, college/career readiness pathway guidance during class registration each semester, a breadth of core and elective course offerings, and individual counseling support. Fifty-two percent (52%) of 2023 CCS graduates indicated on a Senior Exit Survey that they believe that they would not have graduated from high school at all, had they not enrolled at Choices. Seventy-three percent (73%) of 2023 graduates planned to attend college or trade school in the coming four-to-five years. These statistics speak to the ability of the CCS program to rehabilitate learners and guide them to their next educational endeavors. The CA State College/Career Indicator showed that 44% of Californian students were “Prepared” for college and career in 2023, a much higher percentage than experienced at Choices (11%). CCS has been working to build its percentage each year, primarily through improving SBA test preparation techniques, the new availability of a Career Technical Education Pathway in Business & Finance, and continued availability of A-G, AP, and World Languages courses. CCS has recently modified its Graduation Outcomes to focus on reaching goals, modeled through the process of approaching high school graduation and post-secondary endeavors. Most CCS Students plan to attend community college or trade schools or have other undeclared plans for after high school - paths that do not require the completion of a specific college/career pathway. However, since Spring 2021, students have been guided in choosing and following a path that will designate them as “Prepared” for career success and/or enrollment in four-year universities, should they ultimately choose one of these options. Internally collected data suggests that more students are thinking about pursuing additional education after high school graduation and nearly all feel ready to take on the next steps. On the 2023 Student School Satisfaction Survey, 87% of students stated that they want to go to college / vocational school (up from 73% in the previous year), and on the 2023 Students with Disabilities Attitude Survey, 66% of surveyed students stated that they wanted to go to college /

- **Student Anxiety Levels (New Student Survey, Student School Satisfaction Survey)**: Student anxiety has been a growing concern in today’s schools, and Choices has been committed to doing all that it can to meet the needs of a sizable subgroup of anxious students. On average, between 2019 and 2022, 22% of new students reported that “social/other anxiety” was one of the main reasons that they moved to Choices. The flexible, small, nurturing program at Choices provides a learning environment that effectively stabilizes or reduces the anxiety that many students feel about school. Expanded mental health services and augmented faculty outreach to students in 2020-21 and 2021-22 provided additional support for students who struggled during the pandemic. Nearly all students report that their anxiety levels are the same or lower than before they enrolled; in most cases, more than half of students have reported a drop in their anxiety levels. Sample sizes are small, and this data point will continue to be watched over multiple years to identify ongoing trends.

- **Chronic Absenteeism**: At Choices and throughout the state, Chronic Absenteeism rates rose dramatically during and immediately following the COVID-19 campus closure in 2020-21. Chronic Absenteeism at Choices has been dropping slightly each year and is aligned with state figures. Like throughout the state, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students and English Learners experience greater rates of Chronic Absenteeism than All Students. Chronic Absenteeism rates for English Learners are more volatile at Choices due to a very small sample size.

- **English Language Proficiency of English Learners (ELPAC)**: At Choices, English Learners are guided in language development through enrollment in an English Language Development (ELD) course. In 2022-23, a new ELD curriculum, Learning Tree, was piloted and is being used again in 2023-24. In 2023-24, an additional ELD support class was added to the schedule in order to reduce class sizes and group together students of similar grade levels. Upon enrollment, English Learners are also encouraged to enroll in classroom-based elective courses and to participate in extracurricular activities, promoting presence in collaborative environments that will build listening and speaking skills. English Learners comprise just 6% of the Choices student population, and typically, fewer than eleven students produce scores on the summative ELPAC assessment each year. In order to protect individual students’ privacy, ELPAC scores are not published publicly when the sample size is small. In 2023, for the first time, more than ten students took the ELPAC exam, and group scores were made available online. In 2022-23 at Choices, a lower percentage of English Learners progressed to a higher level of English proficiency than they did in the state, but a greater percentage of English Learners maintained their existing proficiency levels, and a lower percentage of English Learners dropped a level or more. This data demonstrates that English Learners stabilize, sometimes grow, and rarely lose skills while at Choices.

Choices is very pleased with the growth and equity reflected in its Graduation Rate, CAASPP scores, i-Ready scores, College Career Indicator, Chronic Absenteeism data, ELPAC data, and encouraging and validating locally collected survey data. However, standardized data that lags behind corresponding state averages continues to point to areas of need. In 2023, the Graduation Rates of All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students were lower than corresponding state averages, as were the percentages of All Students, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, and “Ever-EL” English Learners who met or exceeded standard on the CAASPP Math SBA and the percentages of All Students and "Ever-EL" English Learners on the ELA SBA. The California State average College Career Indicator is

# Engaging Educational Partners

A summary of the process used to engage educational partners in the development of the LCAP.

School districts and county offices of education must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, local bargaining units, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.

Charter schools must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.

An LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also consult with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for each applicable school.

## Introduction and Instructions

The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) requires local educational agencies (LEAs) to engage their local educational partners in an annual planning process to evaluate their progress within eight state priority areas encompassing all statutory metrics (COEs have 10 state priorities). LEAs document the results of this planning process in the LCAP using the template adopted by the State Board of Education.

The LCAP development process serves three distinct, but related functions:

- **Comprehensive Strategic Planning**: The process of developing and annually updating the LCAP supports comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the California School Dashboard (California Education Code [EC] Section 52064[e][1]). Strategic planning that is comprehensive connects budgetary decisions to teaching and learning performance data. LEAs should continually evaluate the hard choices they make about the use of limited resources to meet student and community needs to ensure opportunities and outcomes are improved for all students.

- **Meaningful Engagement of Educational Partners**: The LCAP development process should result in an LCAP that reflects decisions made through meaningful engagement (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Local educational partners possess valuable perspectives and insights about an LEA's programs and services. Effective strategic planning will incorporate these perspectives and insights in order to identify potential goals and actions to be included in the LCAP.

- **Accountability and Compliance**: The LCAP serves an important accountability function because the nature of some LCAP template sections require LEAs to show that they have complied with various requirements specified in LCFF statutes and regulations, most notably:
  - Demonstrating that LEAs are increasing or improving services for foster youth, English learners, including long-term English learners, and low-income students in proportion to the amount of additional funding those students generate under LCFF (EC Section 52064[b][4-6]).

Page 67 of 910
<!-- Page 911 -->

- Establishing goals, supported by actions and related expenditures, that address the statutory priority areas and statutory metrics (EC sections 52064[b][1] and [2]).

  - NOTE: As specified in EC Section 62064(b)(1), the LCAP must provide a description of the annual goals, for all pupils and each subgroup of pupils identified pursuant to EC Section 52052, to be achieved for each of the state priorities. Beginning in 2023–24, EC Section 52052 identifies long-term English learners as a separate and distinct pupil subgroup with a numerical significance at 15 students.

- Annually reviewing and updating the LCAP to reflect progress toward the goals (EC Section 52064[b][7]).

- Ensuring that all increases attributable to supplemental and concentration grant calculations, including concentration grant add-on funding and/or LCFF carryover, are reflected in the LCAP (EC sections 52064[b][6], [8], and [11]).

The LCAP template, like each LEA’s final adopted LCAP, is a document, not a process. LEAs must use the template to memorialize the outcome of their LCAP development process, which must: (a) reflect comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the California School Dashboard (Dashboard), (b) through meaningful engagement with educational partners that (c) meets legal requirements, as reflected in the final adopted LCAP. The sections included within the LCAP template do not and cannot reflect the full development process, just as the LCAP template itself is not intended as a tool for engaging educational partners.

If a county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction over a single school district, the county board of education and the governing board of the school district may adopt and file for review and approval a single LCAP consistent with the requirements in EC sections 52060, 52062, 52066, 52068, and 52070. The LCAP must clearly articulate to which entity’s budget (school district or county superintendent of schools) all budgeted and actual expenditures are aligned.

The revised LCAP template for the 2024–25, 2025–26, and 2026–27 school years reflects statutory changes made through Senate Bill 114 (Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review), Chapter 48, Statutes of 2023.

At its most basic, the adopted LCAP should attempt to distill not just what the LEA is doing for students in transitional kindergarten through grade twelve (TK–12), but also allow educational partners to understand what and why, and whether those strategies are leading to improved opportunities and outcomes for students. LEAs are strongly encouraged to use language and a level of detail in their adopted LCAPs intended to be meaningful and accessible for the LEA’s diverse educational partners and the broader public.

In developing and finalizing the LCAP for adoption, LEAs are encouraged to keep the following overarching frame at the forefront of the strategic planning and educational partner engagement functions:

Given present performance across the state priorities and on indicators in the Dashboard, how is the LEA using its budgetary resources to respond to TK–12 student and community needs, and address any performance gaps, including by meeting its obligation to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students? 

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 86-911
<!-- Page 912 -->
![Page 69](https://example.com/image.png)

LEAs are encouraged to focus on a set of metrics and actions which, based on research, experience, and input gathered from educational partners, the LEA believes will have the biggest impact on behalf of its TK–12 students.

These instructions address the requirements for each section of the LCAP, but may include information about effective practices when developing the LCAP and completing the LCAP document. Additionally, the beginning of each template section includes information emphasizing the purpose that section serves.

## Plan Summary

### Purpose
A well-developed Plan Summary section provides a meaningful context for the LCAP. This section provides information about an LEA’s community as well as relevant information about student needs and performance. In order to present a meaningful context for the rest of the LCAP, the content of this section should be clearly and meaningfully related to the content included throughout each subsequent section of the LCAP.

### Requirements and Instructions

#### General Information
A description of the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades transitional kindergarten–12, as applicable to the LEA.

Briefly describe the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades TK–12, as applicable to the LEA.

- For example, information about an LEA in terms of geography, enrollment, employment, the number and size of specific schools, recent community challenges, and other such information the LEA may wish to include can enable a reader to more fully understand the LEA’s LCAP.
  
- As part of this response, identify all schools within the LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funding.

#### Reflections: Annual Performance
A reflection on annual performance based on a review of the California School Dashboard (Dashboard) and local data.

Reflect on the LEA’s annual performance on the Dashboard and local data. This may include both successes and challenges identified by the LEA during the development process.

LEAs are encouraged to highlight how they are addressing the identified needs of student groups, and/or schools within the LCAP as part of this response.

As part of this response, the LEA must identify the following, which will remain unchanged during the three-year LCAP cycle:

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 69 912
<!-- Page 913 -->
- Any school within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard;
- Any student group within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard; and/or
- Any student group within a school within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard.

**Reflections: Technical Assistance**  
As applicable, a summary of the work underway as part of technical assistance.

Annually identify the reason(s) the LEA is eligible for or has requested technical assistance consistent with EC sections 47607.3, 52071, 52071.5, 52072, or 52072.5, and provide a summary of the work underway as part of receiving technical assistance. The most common form of this technical assistance is frequently referred to as Differentiated Assistance, however this also includes LEAs that have requested technical assistance from their COE.

- If the LEA is not eligible for or receiving technical assistance, the LEA may respond to this prompt as “Not Applicable.”

**Comprehensive Support and Improvement**  
An LEA with a school or schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement (CSI) under the Every Student Succeeds Act must respond to the following prompts:

**Schools Identified**  
A list of the schools in the LEA that are eligible for comprehensive support and improvement.

- Identify the schools within the LEA that have been identified for CSI.

**Support for Identified Schools**

# Engaging Educational Partners

## Purpose
Significant and purposeful engagement of parents, students, educators, and other educational partners, including those representing the student groups identified by LCFF, is critical to the development of the LCAP and the budget process. Consistent with statute, such engagement should support comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the Dashboard, accountability, and improvement across the state priorities and locally identified priorities (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Engagement of educational partners is an ongoing, annual process.

This section is designed to reflect how the engagement of educational partners influenced the decisions reflected in the adopted LCAP. The goal is to allow educational partners that participated in the LCAP development process and the broader public to understand how the LEA engaged educational partners and the impact of that engagement. LEAs are encouraged to keep this goal in the forefront when completing this section.

## Requirements
### School districts and COEs:
EC sections 52060(g) (California Legislative Information) and 52066(g) (California Legislative Information) specify the educational partners that must be consulted when developing the LCAP:

- Teachers,
- Principals,
- Administrators,
- Other school personnel,
- Local bargaining units of the LEA,
- Parents, and
- Students

A school district or COE receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also consult with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for each applicable school.

Before adopting the LCAP, school districts and COEs must share it with the applicable committees, as identified below under Requirements and Instructions. The superintendent is required by statute to respond in writing to the comments received from these committees. School districts and COEs must also consult with the special education local plan area administrator(s) when developing the LCAP.

### Charter schools:
EC Section 47606.5(d) (California Legislative Information) requires that the following educational partners be consulted with when developing the LCAP:

- Teachers,

---

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 71 914
<!-- Page 915 -->
- Principals,  
- Administrators,  
- Other school personnel,  
- Parents, and  
- Students  

A charter school receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also consult with educational partners at the school generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for the school.

The LCAP should also be shared with, and LEAs should request input from, schoolsite-level advisory groups, as applicable (e.g., schoolsite councils, English Learner Advisory Councils, student advisory groups, etc.), to facilitate alignment between schoolsite and district-level goals. Information and resources that support effective engagement, define student consultation, and provide the requirements for advisory group composition, can be found under Resources on the CDE’s LCAP webpage.

Before the governing board/body of an LEA considers the adoption of the LCAP, the LEA must meet the following legal requirements:

- For school districts, see Education Code Section 52062 (California Legislative Information);  
  - Note: Charter schools using the LCAP as the School Plan for Student Achievement must meet the requirements of EC Section 52062(a).  

- For COEs, see Education Code Section 52068 (California Legislative Information); and  

- For charter schools, see Education Code Section 47606.5 (California Legislative Information).  

- NOTE: As a reminder, the superintendent of a school district or COE must respond, in writing, to comments received by the applicable committees identified in the Education Code sections listed above. This includes the parent advisory committee and may include the English learner parent advisory committee and, as of July 1, 2024, the student advisory committee, as applicable.  

**Instructions**  
Respond to the prompts as follows:  

A summary of the process used to engage educational partners in the development of the LCAP.  
School districts and county offices of education must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, local bargaining units, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.  
Charter schools must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.

- Inclusion of action(s) or a group of actions
- Elimination of action(s) or group of actions
- Changes to the level of proposed expenditures for one or more actions
- Inclusion of action(s) as contributing to increased or improved services for unduplicated students

- Analysis of material differences in expenditures
- Analysis of changes made to a goal for the ensuing LCAP year based on the annual update process
- Analysis of challenges or successes in the implementation of actions

## Goals and Actions

### Purpose
Well-developed goals will clearly communicate to educational partners what the LEA plans to accomplish, what the LEA plans to do in order to accomplish the goal, and how the LEA will know when it has accomplished the goal. A goal statement, associated metrics and expected outcomes, and the actions included in the goal must be in alignment. The explanation for why the LEA included a goal is an opportunity for LEAs to clearly communicate to educational partners and the public why, among the various strengths and areas for improvement highlighted by performance data and strategies and actions that could be pursued, the LEA decided to pursue this goal, and the related metrics, expected outcomes, actions, and expenditures.

A well-developed goal can be focused on the performance relative to a metric or metrics for all students, a specific student group(s), narrowing performance gaps, or implementing programs or strategies expected to impact outcomes. LEAs should assess the performance of their student groups when developing goals and the related actions to achieve such goals.

### Requirements and Instructions
LEAs should prioritize the goals, specific actions, and related expenditures included within the LCAP within one or more state priorities. LEAs must consider performance on the state and local indicators, including their locally collected and reported data for the local indicators that are included in the Dashboard, in determining whether and how to prioritize its goals within the LCAP. As previously stated, strategic planning that is comprehensive connects budgetary decisions to teaching and learning performance data. LEAs should continually evaluate the hard choices they make about the use of limited resources to meet student and community needs to ensure opportunities and outcomes are improved for all students, and to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the Dashboard.

In order to support prioritization of goals, the LCAP template provides LEAs with the option of developing three different kinds of goals:

- **Focus Goal:** A Focus Goal is relatively more concentrated in scope and may focus on a fewer number of metrics to measure improvement. A Focus Goal statement will be time bound and make clear how the goal is to be measured.
  - All Equity Multiplier goals must be developed as focus goals. For additional information, see Required Focus Goal(s) for LEAs Receiving Equity Multiplier Funding below.
<!-- Page 918 -->
- **Broad Goal:** A Broad Goal is relatively less concentrated in its scope and may focus on improving performance across a wide range of metrics.

- **Maintenance of Progress Goal:** A Maintenance of Progress Goal includes actions that may be ongoing without significant changes and allows an LEA to track performance on any metrics not addressed in the other goals of the LCAP.

### Requirement to Address the LCFF State Priorities
At a minimum, the LCAP must address all LCFF priorities and associated metrics articulated in EC sections 52060(d) and 52066(d), as applicable to the LEA. The LCFF State Priorities Summary provides a summary of EC sections 52060(d) and 52066(d) to aid in the development of the LCAP.

Respond to the following prompts, as applicable:

### Focus Goal(s)

**Description**  
The description provided for a Focus Goal must be specific, measurable, and time bound.
- An LEA develops a Focus Goal to address areas of need that may require or benefit from a more specific and data intensive approach.
- The Focus Goal can explicitly reference the metric(s) by which achievement of the goal will be measured and the time frame according to which the LEA expects to achieve the goal.

**Type of Goal**  
Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Focus Goal.

**State Priorities addressed by this goal.**  
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

**An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.**  
Explain why the LEA has chosen to prioritize this goal.
- An explanation must be based on Dashboard data or other locally collected data.
- LEAs must describe how the LEA identified this goal for focused attention, including relevant consultation with educational partners.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 75 918
<!-- Page 919 -->
- LEAs are encouraged to promote transparency and understanding around the decision to pursue a focus goal.

## Required Focus Goal(s) for LEAs Receiving Equity Multiplier Funding

### Description
LEAs receiving Equity Multiplier funding must include one or more focus goals for each school generating Equity Multiplier funding. In addition to addressing the focus goal requirements described above, LEAs must adhere to the following requirements.

Focus goals for Equity Multiplier schoolsites must address the following:

(A) All student groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the Dashboard, and  
(B) Any underlying issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators, if applicable.

- Focus Goals for each and every Equity Multiplier schoolsite must identify specific metrics for each identified student group, as applicable.

- An LEA may create a single goal for multiple Equity Multiplier schoolsites if those schoolsites have the same student group(s) performing at the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the Dashboard or experience similar issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.

  - When creating a single goal for multiple Equity Multiplier schoolsites, the goal must identify the student groups and the performance levels on the Dashboard that the Focus Goal is addressing; or,  
  - The common issues the schoolsites are experiencing in credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators, if applicable.

### Type of Goal
Identify the type of goal being implemented as an Equity Multiplier Focus Goal.

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
Explain why the LEA has chosen to prioritize this goal.

- An explanation must be based on Dashboard data or other locally collected data.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 76 919
<!-- Page 920 -->
- LEAs must describe how the LEA identified this goal for focused attention, including relevant consultation with educational partners.

- LEAs are encouraged to promote transparency and understanding around the decision to pursue a focus goal.

- In addition to this information, the LEA must also identify:
  - The school or schools to which the goal applies

LEAs are encouraged to approach an Equity Multiplier goal from a wholistic standpoint, considering how the goal might maximize student outcomes through the use of LCFF and other funding in addition to Equity Multiplier funds.

- Equity Multiplier funds must be used to supplement, not supplant, funding provided to Equity Multiplier schoolsites for purposes of the LCFF, the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (ELO-P), the Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialists (LCRS) Grant Program, and/or the California Community Schools Partnership (CCSPP).

- This means that Equity Multiplier funds must not be used to replace funding that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement LEA-wide actions identified in the LCAP or that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement provisions of the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP.

Note: EC Section 42238.024(b)(1) (California Legislative Information) requires that Equity Multiplier funds be used for the provision of evidence-based services and supports for students. Evidence-based services and supports are based on objective evidence that has informed the design of the service or support and/or guides the modification of those services and supports. Evidence-based supports and strategies are most commonly based on educational research and/or metrics of LEA, school, and/or student performance.

**Broad Goal**

**Description**

Describe what the LEA plans to achieve through the actions included in the goal.

- The description of a broad goal will be clearly aligned with the expected measurable outcomes included for the goal.

- The goal description organizes the actions and expected outcomes in a cohesive and consistent manner.

- A goal description is specific enough to be measurable in either quantitative or qualitative terms. A broad goal is not as specific as a focus goal. While it is specific enough to be measurable, there are many different metrics for measuring progress toward the goal.

**Type of Goal**

Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Broad Goal.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 77 920
<!-- Page 921 -->
![Page 78](https://example.com/image.png)

State Priorities addressed by this goal.  
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.  
Explain why the LEA developed this goal and how the actions and metrics grouped together will help achieve the goal.

**Maintenance of Progress Goal**  
**Description**  
Describe how the LEA intends to maintain the progress made in the LCFF State Priorities not addressed by the other goals in the LCAP.  
- Use this type of goal to address the state priorities and applicable metrics not addressed within the other goals in the LCAP.  
- The state priorities and metrics to be addressed in this section are those for which the LEA, in consultation with educational partners, has determined to maintain actions and monitor progress while focusing implementation efforts on the actions covered by other goals in the LCAP.

**Type of Goal**  
Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Maintenance of Progress Goal.

State Priorities addressed by this goal.  
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.  
Explain how the actions will sustain the progress exemplified by the related metrics.

**Measuring and Reporting Results:**  
For each LCAP year, identify the metric(s) that the LEA will use to track progress toward the expected outcomes.  
- LEAs must identify metrics for specific student groups, as appropriate, including expected outcomes that address and reduce disparities in outcomes between student groups.  
- The metrics may be quantitative or qualitative; but at minimum, an LEA’s LCAP must include goals that are measured using all of the applicable metrics for the related state priorities, in each LCAP year, as applicable to the type of LEA.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 78 921
<!-- Page 922 -->
- To the extent a state priority does not specify one or more metrics (e.g., implementation of state academic content and performance standards), the LEA must identify a metric to use within the LCAP. For these state priorities, LEAs are encouraged to use metrics based on or reported through the relevant local indicator self-reflection tools in the Dashboard.

- Required metrics for LEA-wide actions: For each action identified as 1) contributing towards the requirement to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, including long-term English learners, and low-income students and 2) being provided on an LEA-wide basis, the LEA must identify one or more metrics to monitor the effectiveness of the action and its budgeted expenditures.
  - These required metrics may be identified within the action description or the first prompt in the increased or improved services section, however the description must clearly identify the metric(s) being used to monitor the effectiveness of the action and the action(s) that the metric(s) apply to.

- Required metrics for Equity Multiplier goals: For each Equity Multiplier goal, the LEA must identify:
  - The specific metrics for each identified student group at each specific schoolsite, as applicable, to measure the progress toward the goal, and/or
  - The specific metrics used to measure progress in meeting the goal related to credentialing, subject matter preparation, or educator retention at each specific schoolsite.

Complete the table as follows:

Metric #
- Enter the metric number.

Metric
- Identify the standard of measure being used to determine progress towards the goal and/or to measure the effectiveness of one or more actions associated with the goal.

Baseline
- Enter the baseline when completing the LCAP for 2024–25.
  - Use the most recent data associated with the metric available at the time of adoption of the LCAP for the first year of the three-year plan. LEAs may use data as reported on the 2023 Dashboard for the baseline of a metric only if that data represents the most recent available data (e.g., high school graduation rate).

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 79 922
<!-- Page 923 -->
- Using the most recent data available may involve reviewing data the LEA is preparing for submission to the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS) or data that the LEA has recently submitted to CALPADS.
  
- Indicate the school year to which the baseline data applies.

- The baseline data must remain unchanged throughout the three-year LCAP.
  
  - This requirement is not intended to prevent LEAs from revising the baseline data if it is necessary to do so. For example, if an LEA identifies that its data collection practices for a particular metric are leading to inaccurate data and revises its practice to obtain accurate data, it would also be appropriate for the LEA to revise the baseline data to align with the more accurate data process and report its results using the accurate data.
  
  - If an LEA chooses to revise its baseline data, then, at a minimum, it must clearly identify the change as part of its response to the description of changes prompt in the Goal Analysis for the goal. LEAs are also strongly encouraged to involve their educational partners in the decision of whether or not to revise a baseline and to communicate the proposed change to their educational partners.

- Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one- or two-year LCAP may identify a new baseline each year, as applicable.

### Year 1 Outcome
- When completing the LCAP for 2025–26, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies.
  
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one-year LCAP may provide the Year 1 Outcome when completing the LCAP for both 2025–26 and 2026–27 or may provide the Year 1 Outcome for 2025–26 and provide the Year 2 Outcome for 2026–27.

### Year 2 Outcome
- When completing the LCAP for 2026–27, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies.
  
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one-year LCAP may identify the Year 2 Outcome as not applicable when completing the LCAP for 2026–27 or may provide the Year 2 Outcome for 2026–27.

### Target for Year 3 Outcome
- When completing the first year of the LCAP, enter the target outcome for the relevant metric the LEA expects to achieve by the end of the three-year LCAP cycle.

**Goal Analysis:**

Enter the LCAP Year.

Using actual annual measurable outcome data, including data from the Dashboard, analyze whether the planned actions were effective towards achieving the goal. “Effective” means the degree to which the planned actions were successful in producing the target result. Respond to the prompts as instructed.

Note: When completing the 2024–25 LCAP, use the 2023–24 Local Control and Accountability Plan Annual Update template to complete the Goal Analysis and identify the Goal Analysis prompts in the 2024–25 LCAP as “Not Applicable.”

A description of overall implementation, including any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions, and any relevant challenges and successes experienced with implementation.

- Describe the overall implementation of the actions to achieve the articulated goal, including relevant challenges and successes experienced with implementation.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 81 924
<!-- Page 925 -->
- Include a discussion of relevant challenges and successes experienced with the implementation process.
  
- This discussion must include any instance where the LEA did not implement a planned action or implemented a planned action in a manner that differs substantively from how it was described in the adopted LCAP.

### An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.
- Explain material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and between the Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services, as applicable. Minor variances in expenditures or percentages do not need to be addressed, and a dollar-for-dollar accounting is not required.

### A description of the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions to date in making progress toward the goal.
- Describe the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions to date in making progress toward the goal. “Effectiveness” means the degree to which the actions were successful in producing the target result and “ineffectiveness” means that the actions did not produce any significant or targeted result.
  
  - In some cases, not all actions in a goal will be intended to improve performance on all of the metrics associated with the goal.
  
  - When responding to this prompt, LEAs may assess the effectiveness of a single action or group of actions within the goal in the context of performance on a single metric or group of specific metrics within the goal that are applicable to the action(s). Grouping actions with metrics will allow for more robust analysis of whether the strategy the LEA is using to impact a specified set of metrics is working and increase transparency for educational partners. LEAs are encouraged to use such an approach when goals include multiple actions and metrics that are not closely associated.
  
  - Beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period.

### A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, target outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.
- Describe any changes made to this goal, expected outcomes, metrics, or actions to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis and analysis of the data provided in the Dashboard or other local data, as applicable.
  
  - As noted above, beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period. For actions that have been identified as ineffective, the LEA must identify the ineffective action and must include a description of the following:
  
    - The reasons for the ineffectiveness, and
  
    - How changes to the action will result in a new or strengthened approach.

![Actions for Foster Youth](https://example.com/image.png)

**Actions for Foster Youth:** School districts, COEs, and charter schools that have a numerically significant foster youth student subgroup are encouraged to include specific actions in the LCAP designed to meet needs specific to foster youth students.

### Required Actions
- LEAs with 30 or more English learners and/or 15 or more long-term English learners must include specific actions in the LCAP related to, at a minimum:
  - Language acquisition programs, as defined in EC Section 306, provided to students, and
  - Professional development for teachers.
  - If an LEA has both 30 or more English learners and 15 or more long-term English learners, the LEA must include actions for both English learners and long-term English learners.

- LEAs eligible for technical assistance pursuant to EC sections 47607.3, 52071, 52071.5, 52072, or 52072.5, must include specific actions within the LCAP related to its implementation of the work underway as part of technical assistance. The most common form of this technical assistance is frequently referred to as Differentiated Assistance.

- LEAs that have Red Dashboard indicators for (1) a school within the LEA, (2) a student group within the LEA, and/or (3) a student group within any school within the LEA must include one or more specific actions within the LCAP:
  - The specific action(s) must be directed towards the identified student group(s) and/or school(s) and must address the identified state indicator(s) for which the student group or school received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard. Each student group and/or school that receives the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard must be addressed by one or more actions.
  - These required actions will be effective for the three-year LCAP cycle.

### Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students

**Purpose**  
A well-written Increased or Improved Services section provides educational partners with a comprehensive description, within a single dedicated section, of how an LEA plans to increase or improve services for its unduplicated students as defined in EC Section 42238.02 in grades TK–12 as compared to all students in grades TK–12, as applicable, and how LEA-wide or schoolwide actions identified for this purpose meet regulatory requirements. Descriptions provided should include sufficient detail yet be sufficiently succinct to promote a broader understanding.

**Understanding of educational partners to facilitate their ability to provide input. An LEA's description in this section must align with the actions included in the Goals and Actions section as contributing.**

**Please Note:** For the purpose of meeting the Increased or Improved Services requirement and consistent with EC Section 42238.02, long-term English learners are included in the English learner student group.

### Statutory Requirements
An LEA is required to demonstrate in its LCAP how it is increasing or improving services for its students who are foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income, collectively referred to as unduplicated students, as compared to the services provided to all students in proportion to the increase in funding it receives based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the LEA (EC Section 42238.07[a][1], EC Section 52064[b][8][B]; 5 CCR Section 15496[a]). This proportionality percentage is also known as the “minimum proportionality percentage” or “MPP.” The manner in which an LEA demonstrates it is meeting its MPP is two-fold: (1) through the expenditure of LCFF funds or through the identification of a Planned Percentage of Improved Services as documented in the Contributing Actions Table, and (2) through the explanations provided in the Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students section.

To improve services means to grow services in quality and to increase services means to grow services in quantity. Services are increased or improved by those actions in the LCAP that are identified in the Goals and Actions section as contributing to the increased or improved services requirement, whether they are provided across the entire LEA (LEA-wide action), provided to an entire school (Schoolwide action), or solely provided to one or more unduplicated student group(s) (Limited action).

Therefore, for any action contributing to meet the increased or improved services requirement, the LEA must include an explanation of:

- How the action is increasing or improving services for the unduplicated student group(s) (Identified Needs and Action Design), and
- How the action meets the LEA's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priority areas (Measurement of Effectiveness).

### LEA-wide and Schoolwide Actions
In addition to the above required explanations, LEAs must provide a justification for why an LEA-wide or Schoolwide action is being provided to all students and how the action is intended to improve outcomes for unduplicated student group(s) as compared to all students.

- Conclusory statements that a service will help achieve an expected outcome for the goal, without an explicit connection or further explanation as to how, are not sufficient.
- Further, simply stating that an LEA has a high enrollment percentage of a specific student group or groups does not meet the increased or improved services standard because enrolling students is not the same as serving students.

### For School Districts Only
Actions provided on an LEA-wide basis at school districts with an unduplicated pupil percentage of less than 55 percent must also include a description of how the actions are the most effective use of the funds to meet the district's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state.

Total Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants
- Specify the amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grant funds the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year based on the number and concentration of foster youth, English learner, and low-income students. This amount includes the Additional 15 percent LCFF Concentration Grant.

Projected Additional 15 percent LCFF Concentration Grant
- Specify the amount of additional LCFF concentration grant add-on funding, as described in EC Section 42238.02, that the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year.

Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year
- Specify the estimated percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

LCFF Carryover — Percentage
- Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

LCFF Carryover — Dollar
- Specify the LCFF Carryover — Dollar amount identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover amount is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify an amount of zero ($0).

Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year
<!-- Page 930 -->
- Add the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the Proportional LCFF Required Carryover Percentage and specify the percentage. This is the LEA’s percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year, as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

**Required Descriptions:**
**LEA-wide and Schoolwide Actions**  
For each action being provided to an entire LEA or school, provide an explanation of (1) the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed, (2) how the action is designed to address the identified need(s) and why it is being provided on an LEA or schoolwide basis, and (3) the metric(s) used to measure the effectiveness of the action in improving outcomes for the unduplicated student group(s).

If the LEA has provided this required description in the Action Descriptions, state as such within the table.

Complete the table as follows:

**Identified Need(s)**  
Provide an explanation of the unique identified need(s) of the LEA’s unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed.

An LEA demonstrates how an action is principally directed towards an unduplicated student group(s) when the LEA explains the need(s), condition(s), or circumstance(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) identified through a needs assessment and how the action addresses them. A meaningful needs assessment includes, at a minimum, analysis of applicable student achievement data and educational partner feedback.

**How the Action(s) are Designed to Address Need(s) and Why it is Provided on an LEA-wide or Schoolwide Basis**  
Provide an explanation of how the action as designed will address the unique identified need(s) of the LEA’s unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed and the rationale for why the action is being provided on an LEA-wide or schoolwide basis.

- As stated above, conclusory statements that a service will help achieve an expected outcome for the goal, without an explicit connection or further explanation as to how, are not sufficient.

- Further, simply stating that an LEA has a high enrollment percentage of a specific student group or groups does not meet the increased or improved services standard because enrolling students is not the same as serving students.

**Metric(s) to Monitor Effectiveness**  
Identify the metric(s) being used to measure the progress and effectiveness of the action(s).

![Note for COEs and Charter Schools: In the case of COEs and charter schools, schoolwide and LEA-wide are considered to be synonymous.](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

## Limited Actions

For each action being solely provided to one or more unduplicated student group(s), provide an explanation of (1) the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served, (2) how the action is designed to address the identified need(s), and (3) how the effectiveness of the action in improving outcomes for the unduplicated student group(s) will be measured.

If the LEA has provided the required descriptions in the Action Descriptions, state as such.

Complete the table as follows:

### Identified Need(s)

Provide an explanation of the unique need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served identified through the LEA’s needs assessment. A meaningful needs assessment includes, at a minimum, analysis of applicable student achievement data and educational partner feedback.

### How the Action(s) are Designed to Address Need(s)

Provide an explanation of how the action is designed to address the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served.

### Metric(s) to Monitor Effectiveness

Identify the metric(s) being used to measure the progress and effectiveness of the action(s).

For any limited action contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement that is associated with a Planned Percentage of Improved Services in the Contributing Summary Table rather than an expenditure of LCFF funds, describe the methodology that was used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage, as applicable.

- For each action with an identified Planned Percentage of Improved Services, identify the goal and action number and describe the methodology that was used.

- When identifying a Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA must describe the methodology that it used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. The percentage of improved services for an action corresponds to the amount of LCFF funding that the LEA estimates it would expend to implement the action if it were funded.

- For example, an LEA determines that there is a need to analyze data to ensure that instructional aides and expanded learning providers know what targeted supports to provide to students who are foster youth. The LEA could implement this action by hiring additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students, which, based on the LEA’s current pay scale, the LEA estimates would cost $165,000. Instead, the LEA chooses to utilize a portion of existing staff time to analyze data relating to students who are.

foster youth. This analysis will then be shared with site principals who will use the data to coordinate services provided by instructional assistants and expanded learning providers to target support to students. In this example, the LEA would divide the estimated cost of $165,000 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Total Planned Expenditures Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Planned Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

## Additional Concentration Grant Funding
A description of the plan for how the additional concentration grant add-on funding identified above will be used to increase the number of staff providing direct services to students at schools that have a high concentration (above 55 percent) of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students, as applicable.

An LEA that receives the additional concentration grant add-on described in EC Section 42238.02 is required to demonstrate how it is using these funds to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent as compared to the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is equal to or less than 55 percent. The staff who provide direct services to students must be certificated staff and/or classified staff employed by the LEA; classified staff includes custodial staff.

Provide the following descriptions, as applicable to the LEA:

- An LEA that does not receive a concentration grant or the concentration grant add-on must indicate that a response to this prompt is not applicable.

- Identify the goal and action numbers of the actions in the LCAP that the LEA is implementing to meet the requirement to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

- An LEA that does not have comparison schools from which to describe how it is using the concentration grant add-on funds, such as a single-school LEA or an LEA that only has schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, must describe how it is using the funds to increase the number of credentialed staff, classified staff, or both, including custodial staff, who provide direct services to students at selected schools and the criteria used to determine which schools require additional staffing support.

- In the event that an additional concentration grant add-on is not sufficient to increase staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, the LEA must describe how it is using the funds to retain staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

Complete the table as follows:

- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA.

- The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA.
- The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.
- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA.
- The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA.
- The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of FTE staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.

## Action Tables
Complete the Total Planned Expenditures Table for each action in the LCAP. The information entered into this table will automatically populate the other Action Tables. Information is only entered into the Total Planned Expenditures Table, the Annual Update Table, the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, and the LCFF Carryover Table. The word "input" has been added to column headers to aid in identifying the column(s) where information will be entered. Information is not entered on the remaining Action tables.

The following tables are required to be included as part of the LCAP adopted by the local governing board or governing body:
- **Table 1:** Total Planned Expenditures Table (for the coming LCAP Year)
- **Table 2:** Contributing Actions Table (for the coming LCAP Year)
- **Table 3:** Annual Update Table (for the current LCAP Year)
- **Table 4:** Contributing Actions Annual Update Table (for the current LCAP Year)
- **Table 5:** LCFF Carryover Table (for the current LCAP Year)

Note: The coming LCAP Year is the year that is being planned for, while the current LCAP year is the current year of implementation. For example, when developing the 2024–25 LCAP, 2024–25 will be the coming LCAP Year and 2023–24 will be the current LCAP Year.

## Total Planned Expenditures Table
In the Total Planned Expenditures Table, input the following information for each action in the LCAP for that applicable LCAP year:

Projected LCFF Base Grant**: Provide the total amount estimated LCFF entitlement for the coming school year, excluding the supplemental and concentration grants and the add-ons for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant program, the former Home-to-School Transportation program, and the Small School District Transportation program, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). Note that the LCFF Base Grant for purposes of the LCAP also includes the Necessary Small Schools and Economic Recovery Target allowances for school districts, and County Operations Grant for COEs.

  See EC sections 2574 (for COEs) and 42238.02 (for school districts and charter schools), as applicable, for LCFF entitlement calculations.

- **2. Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants**: Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants estimated on the basis of the number and concentration of unduplicated students for the coming school year.

- **3. Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year**: This percentage will not be entered; it is calculated based on the Projected LCFF Base Grant and the Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the coming LCAP year.

- **LCFF Carryover — Percentage**: Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table from the prior LCAP year. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

- **Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year**: This percentage will not be entered; it is calculated based on the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the LCFF Carryover — Percentage. This is the percentage by which the LEA must increase or improve services for unduplicated pupils as compared to the services provided to all students in the coming LCAP year.

- **Goal #**: Enter the LCAP Goal number for the action.

- **Action #**: Enter the action’s number as indicated in the LCAP Goal.

- **Action Title**: Provide a title of the action.

- **Student Group(s)**: Indicate the student group or groups who will be the primary beneficiary of the action by entering “All,” or by entering a specific student group or groups.

- **Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?**: Type “Yes” if the action is included as contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement; OR, type “No” if the action is not included as contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement.
<!-- Page 935 -->
- If “Yes” is entered into the Contributing column, then complete the following columns:
  - **Scope**: The scope of an action may be LEA-wide (i.e., districtwide, countywide, or charterwide), schoolwide, or limited. An action that is LEA-wide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of the LEA. An action that is schoolwide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of a single school. An action that is limited in its scope is an action that serves only one or more unduplicated student groups.
  - **Unduplicated Student Group(s)**: Regardless of scope, contributing actions serve one or more unduplicated student groups. Indicate one or more unduplicated student groups for whom services are being increased or improved as compared to what all students receive.
  - **Location**: Identify the location where the action will be provided. If the action is provided to all schools within the LEA, the LEA must indicate “All Schools.” If the action is provided to specific schools within the LEA or specific grade spans only, the LEA must enter “Specific Schools” or “Specific Grade Spans.” Identify the individual school or a subset of schools or grade spans (e.g., all high schools or grades transitional kindergarten through grade five), as appropriate.
  
- **Time Span**: Enter “ongoing” if the action will be implemented for an indeterminate period of time. Otherwise, indicate the span of time for which the action will be implemented. For example, an LEA might enter “1 Year,” or “2 Years,” or “6 Months.”

- **Total Personnel**: Enter the total amount of personnel expenditures utilized to implement this action.

- **Total Non-Personnel**: This amount will be automatically calculated based on information provided in the Total Personnel column and the Total Funds column.

- **LCFF Funds**: Enter the total amount of LCFF funds utilized to implement this action, if any. LCFF funds include all funds that make up an LEA’s total LCFF target (i.e., base grant, grade span adjustment, supplemental grant, concentration grant, Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant, and Home-To-School Transportation).
  - **Note**: For an action to contribute towards meeting the increased or improved services requirement, it must include some measure of LCFF funding. The action may also include funding from other sources, however the extent to which an action contributes to meeting the increased or improved services requirement is based on the LCFF funding being used to implement the action.

- **Other State Funds**: Enter the total amount of Other State Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.
  - **Note**: Equity Multiplier funds must be included in the “Other State Funds” category, not in the “LCFF Funds” category. As a reminder, Equity Multiplier funds must be used to supplement, not supplant, funding provided to Equity Multiplier schoolsites for purposes of the LCFF, the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP. This means that Equity Multiplier funds must not be used to replace funding that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement LEA-wide actions identified in the LEA’s LCAP or that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement provisions of the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP.

<!-- Page 936 -->
- **Local Funds:** Enter the total amount of Local Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.
  
- **Federal Funds:** Enter the total amount of Federal Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.
  
- **Total Funds:** This amount is automatically calculated based on amounts entered in the previous four columns.
  
- **Planned Percentage of Improved Services:** For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the planned quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%). A limited action is an action that only serves foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income students.

  - As noted in the instructions for the Increased or Improved Services section, when identifying a Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA must describe the methodology that is used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. The percentage of improved services for an action corresponds to the amount of LCFF funding that the LEA estimates it would expend to implement the action if it were funded.

  - For example, an LEA determines that there is a need to analyze data to ensure that instructional aides and expanded learning providers know what targeted supports to provide to students who are foster youth. The LEA could implement this action by hiring additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students, which, based on the LEA’s current pay scale, the LEA estimates would cost $165,000. Instead, the LEA chooses to utilize a portion of existing staff time to analyze data relating to students who are foster youth. This analysis will then be shared with site principals who will use the data to coordinate services provided by instructional assistants and expanded learning providers to target support to students. In this example, the LEA would divide the estimated cost of $165,000 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Planned Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

**Contributing Actions Table**  
As noted above, information will not be entered in the Contributing Actions Table; however, the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column will need to be checked to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses.

**Annual Update Table**  
In the Annual Update Table, provide the following information for each action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditures to implement this action, if any.
<!-- Page 937 -->
# Contributing Actions Annual Update Table

In the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, check the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses. Provide the following information for each contributing action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

- **6. Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants:** Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants estimated based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the current school year.

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditure of LCFF funds used to implement this action, if any.

- **Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services:** For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis only to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the total estimated actual quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%).

  - Building on the example provided above for calculating the Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA in the example implements the action. As part of the annual update process, the LEA reviews implementation and student outcome data and determines that the action was implemented with fidelity and that outcomes for foster youth students improved. The LEA reviews the original estimated cost for the action and determines that had it hired additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students that estimated actual cost would have been $169,500 due to a cost of living adjustment. The LEA would divide the estimated actual cost of $169,500 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

# LCFF Carryover Table

- **9. Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant:** Provide the total amount of estimated LCFF Target Entitlement for the current school year, excluding the supplemental and concentration grants and the add-ons for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant program, the former Home-to-School Transportation program, and the Small School District Transportation program, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). Note that the LCFF Base Grant for purposes of the LCAP also includes the Necessary Small Schools and Economic Recovery Target allowances for school districts, and County Operations Grant for COEs. See EC sections 2574 (for COEs) and 42238.02 (for school districts and charter schools), as applicable, for LCFF entitlement calculations.

- **10. Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Current School Year:** This percentage will not be entered. The percentage is calculated based on the amounts of the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9) and the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants (6), pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8), plus the LCFF Carryover – Percentage from the prior year. This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the current LCAP year.

# Calculations in the Action Tables

To reduce the duplication of effort of LEAs, the Action Tables include functionality such as pre-population of fields and cells based on the information provided in the Data Entry Table, the Annual Update Summary Table, and the Contributing Actions Table. For transparency, the functionality and calculations used are provided below.

## Contributing Actions Table

- **4. Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (LCFF Funds)**
  - This amount is the total of the Planned Expenditures for Contributing Actions (LCFF Funds) column.

- **5. Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services**
  - This percentage is the total of the Planned Percentage of Improved Services column.

- **Planned Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the coming school year (4 divided by 1, plus 5)**
  - This percentage is calculated by dividing the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) by the Projected LCFF Base Grant (1), converting the quotient to a percentage, and adding it to the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5).

## Contributing Actions Annual Update Table

Pursuant to EC Section 42238.07(c)(2), if the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) is less than the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants (6), the LEA is required to calculate the difference between the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5) and the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (7). If the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) is equal to or greater than the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants (6), the Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services will display “Not Required.”

- **6. Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants**
  - This is the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants the LEA estimates it will actually receive based on of the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the current school year.

- **4. Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (LCFF Funds)**
  - This amount is the total of the Last Year's Planned Expenditures for Contributing Actions (LCFF Funds).

- **7. Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions**
  - This amount is the total of the Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (LCFF Funds).
<!-- Page 939 -->
- **Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (Subtract 7 from 4)**
  - This amount is the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (7) subtracted from the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4).

- **5. Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (%)**
  - This amount is the total of the Planned Percentage of Improved Services column.

- **8. Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (%)**
  - This amount is the total of the Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services column.

- **Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (Subtract 5 from 8)**
  - This amount is the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5) subtracted from the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (8).

**LCFF Carryover Table**

- **10. Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Current School Year (6 divided by 9 plus Carryover %)**
  - This percentage is the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants (6) divided by the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9) plus the LCFF Carryover – Percentage from the prior year.

- **11. Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (7 divided by 9, plus 8)**
  - This percentage is the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (7) divided by the LCFF Funding (9), then converting the quotient to a percentage and adding the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (8).

- **12. LCFF Carryover — Dollar Amount LCFF Carryover (Subtract 11 from 10 and multiply by 9)**
  - If the Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (11) is less than the Estimated Actual Percentage to Increase or Improve Services (10), the LEA is required to carry over LCFF funds.
  
  The amount of LCFF funds is calculated by subtracting the Estimated Actual Percentage to Increase or Improve Services (11) from the Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (10) and then multiplying by the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9). This amount is the amount of LCFF funds that is required to be carried over to the coming year.

- **13. LCFF Carryover — Percentage (12 divided by 9)**
<!-- Page 940 -->
- This percentage is the unmet portion of the Percentage to Increase or Improve Services that the LEA must carry over into the coming LCAP year. The percentage is calculated by dividing the LCFF Carryover (12) by the LCFF Funding (9).

Not later than five days after that adoption or by July 1, whichever occurs first, the governing board shall file that budget with the county superintendent of schools. That budget and supporting data shall be maintained and made available for public review. In accordance with Assembly Bill 97 (Chapter 47/2013), for the 2015/2016 fiscal year, and each fiscal year thereafter, the governing board of the school district shall not adopt a budget before the governing board of the school district adopts a local control accountability plan, if an existing Local Control and Accountability Plan is not effective for the budget year.  

The board shall not adopt a budget that does not include the expenditures necessary to implement the local control accountability plan or the annual update to a local control and accountability plan that is effective during the subsequent fiscal year. On June 11, 2024, the 2024-2025 budget document, including staffing standards, was presented to the board, and a public hearing was held. At the budget adoption public hearing, per Education Code section 42127(a)(2)(B), a statement of the reasons that substantiate the need for assigned and unassigned ending fund balances in excess of the minimum reserve standard for economic uncertainties was provided. Prior to the adoption of the budget, the board is required to approve the Local Control and Accountability Plan.

**Superintendent’s Message**

Aligning our resources to be most effective for our highest priorities is key to providing successful outcomes for our students. Last school year, our district engaged in a strategic planning process by collecting input and feedback from a variety of educational partners including students, families, community members and staff. Their voices informed the development of our new strategic plan.

The new plan calls out our daily mission, to partner with our community in setting high expectations for academic achievement rooted in equity and unity to create supportive learning experiences in which students, families and staff can excel and thrive. To do this, our investments over the next several years will be aligned with the plan’s four strategic directions:

I. Advance and Support Student Success  
II. Prioritize Equitable Practices  
III. Enhance Employee Systems and Supports  
IV. Engage Students, Families and Community as Valued Educational Partners  

Each of these four areas identifies outcomes we must achieve to be successful and recognizes that we as a community must all be a part of educating our youth. Each year the budgeting process helps us identify where we will apply our resources and as we move forward, that work will be led by this strategic plan. Please take a moment to review the plan at [www.sanjuan.edu/strategicplan](http://www.sanjuan.edu/strategicplan).

I deeply appreciate the ongoing support of our students and schools from the San Juan Unified community and look forward to the year ahead.

# OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTION

## FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

The San Juan Unified School District financial status is comprised of three major components: (1) Fund Balance (Ending and Beginning Balance); (2) Revenues; and (3) Expenditures. This document reflects audited figures for 2022-23, estimated actuals for 2023-24, adopted budget for 2024-25 and multi-year projections for 2025-26 and 2026-27.

## DISTRICT MISSION

We partner with our San Juan Unified community in setting high expectations for academic achievement rooted in equity and unity to create supportive learning experiences in which all students, families and staff can excel and thrive.

## SHARED VALUES

We value:

- **Belonging**  
  We create a community that cultivates welcoming and inclusive environments with genuine respect for our diversity of cultures, identities and abilities.

- **Relevance**  
  We design experiences and environments where each learner can explore and apply skills and knowledge that align with evolving careers and workplaces.

- **Voice**  
  We honor and affirm all voices of our school community and encourage them to share their perspectives to help improve and shape what we do and how we do it.

- **Social and Emotional Intelligence**  
  We build a culture that teaches, models and applies social and emotional intelligence in all interactions with each other.

- **Resilience**  
  We create nurturing schools and programs that inspire each learner to continue to persevere, gain strength and develop the confidence to excel beyond challenges.

- **Championing**  
  We support and advocate for those in our San Juan Unified community who are disproportionately impacted or marginalized by circumstances beyond their control.

- **Innovation**  
  We embrace and encourage creative thinking and learning environments that transform ideas into actionable solutions.

# CORE COMMITMENTS
- Prioritize resources to close opportunity gaps, improve teaching and learning, recruit and retain high quality employees and help all students reach their potential.
- Provide sound fiscal stewardship of community resources.
- Build trust by sharing useful, transparent fiscal information.
- Adopt a budget that consistently balances ongoing revenues and expenditures to avoid a structural deficit.

# CORE MESSAGES
- Governor Newsom released his revised 2024-25 budget on May 10, 2024. It reflects a current-year shortfall of $27.6 billion and a shortfall of $28.4 billion deficit for next year.
- The proposal includes a 1.07% COLA to the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and is applied to categorical programs such as special education and school nutrition.
- Outside education, the Governor proposes significant spending cuts to government operations, reductions to programs, and pauses of new investments. Thankfully, K-14 education continues to be shielded from ongoing programmatic reductions.
- The Governor proposes to fully deplete the Proposition 98 Rainy Day Fund.
- The risks to the state’s budget include inflation, the highest unemployment rate in the nation, slow economic growth, high interest rates, and geopolitical factors.
- The district will continue to exercise caution and flexibility in long-term fiscal planning.
- Preserve an ending fund balance that ensures the integrity and stability of the district.

# SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION (SCOE)
The Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) reviews all district budgets and interim budget reports. SCOE has an oversight obligation to monitor the district’s long-term fiscal health as prescribed in AB 1200. SCOE has provided the following guidance:
- Re-evaluate spending priorities to address student achievement and begin new initiatives only if long-term solvency can be maintained (avoid cycles of additions and reductions).
- Strategically invest stimulus funds to help students recover learning loss, provide wrap-around supports, and reduce future operational costs.
- Exercise caution and maintain flexibility in the collective bargaining process. Neighboring districts have widely divergent funding levels.
- Maintain reserves greater than the minimum requirement.
- Support ongoing expenditures with ongoing revenues.

# PROPOSITION 55 AND THE EDUCATION PROTECTION ACT (EPA)
Proposition 55 was passed by voters in November 2016. It extends the temporary personal income tax increase first enacted by Proposition 30. While the higher tax rates for high-income earners will be extended for an additional 12 years (through 2030), the sales tax increase expired at the end of 2016.

# STATE FUNDING AND AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE

California funds schools based on student attendance, also known as Average Daily Attendance (ADA). A student attending every day would equal one ADA. ADA is not the same as enrollment, which is the number of students officially enrolled in district schools. Average Daily Attendance is used to calculate a district’s proportionate share of state revenue from resources such as; the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), Special Education, and Lottery funds.

## San Juan Unified School District Funded ADA

| Year               | Funded ADA   |
|--------------------|--------------|
| 2022-23 Actual     | 36,931.83    |

| 2024-25 Projected  | 35,891.28    |
| 2025-26 Projected  | 36,891.28    |
| 2026-27 Projected  | 35,891.28    |

## 2024-25 LCFF Funding Factors

Students are funded based on grade spans. Students in grades K-3 receive an adjustment for smaller class sizes as well as TK students commencing in 2022/23. Students in grades 9-12 receive an adjustment for Career Technical Education (CTE).

| Grade Span | 2024-25 Base Grant Per ADA | Grade Span Adjustment | 2024-25 Total Base Grant Per ADA |

# 2025-2027 MULTI-YEAR PROJECTIONS

The district used estimates from the Department of Finance (DOF) to project LCFF revenue growth in 2025-26 and 2026-27. The district Planning Department provides enrollment estimates, which are used to calculate Average Daily Attendance (ADA), the basis of state funding.

Operating costs for future years are projected using historical patterns and probabilities. Significant expenditure planning factors include: salaries, seniority and retirement of employees, health care and other benefit costs, pension costs, utilities, property and liability insurance premiums, etc.

**Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)**  
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) is a California law passed in 2013 that changed the method of distributing funds from the state to local school districts. LCFF funds include a base level grant for all Local Education Agencies (LEA) based on Average Daily Attendance. Additional funding is provided through supplemental and concentration grants based on the unduplicated number of high need students in the following categories: English learner, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and foster youth.

**Eight Areas of State Priority**  
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) also lists eight state priority areas that every district must address in their Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) to ensure a high-quality educational program for students focused on conditions for learning, engagement, and pupil outcomes:
- **Conditions for Learning:** Basic services, implementation of state standards, course access
- **Engagement:** Parent engagement, pupil engagement, school climate
- **Pupil Outcomes:** Pupil achievement, other pupil outcomes

**Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP)**  
In order to access the funds from the State of California, LEAs develop a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP). The LCAP is a three-year plan that is revised annually, addresses the Eight State Priorities, includes the perspectives and ideas of our educational partners, and describes how services are provided to improve student performance with an emphasis on English learner, low income, and foster youth students.

**LCAP Goals**  
The 2022-27 LCAP is designed around four goals that are aligned to the state priority areas and required LCAP metrics. These goals include:
1. **Student Achievement and Implementation of State Standards** - Improve achievement and outcomes for all students as measured by performance on statewide assessments, English proficiency, and college and career preparedness.
2. **Student Engagement and Course Access** - Provide students with engaging programs, course work, and opportunities that address attendance, dropout, graduation, and access to a broad course of study.
3. **School Conditions, Climate, and Family Engagement** - Address factors both inside and outside the classroom that impact student success such as family engagement, health, safety, discipline, connectedness, facilities, materials, and staffing.
4. **Schools with Non-Stability Rates of +25% and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Rates of +70%** - Within three years, improve outcomes for student groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators, and address any underlying issues with credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.

State and Local Metrics  
California has adopted state and local indicators to measure school district and individual school site performance in each of the state priorities. Performance data on state and local indicators is publicly reported on the California School Dashboard and in the LCAP to provide families and educators with information on school and district progress. State Indicators apply to all districts, schools, and student groups and are based on data that is collected consistently across the state whereas Local Indicators apply to districts and charters and are collected at the district level.  

Continuous Improvement  
Each year, the LCAP is updated using a continuous improvement process focused on:  
- Building on the work currently being implemented to maintain continuity of learning  
- Analyzing multiples sources of data that includes educational partner input, state and local data, and research  
- Refining actions based on what is learned in order to improve

### Part I - General Administrative Share of Plant Services Costs
California's indirect cost plan allows that the general administrative costs in the indirect cost pool may include that portion of plant services costs (maintenance and operations costs and facilities rents and leases) attributable to the general administrative offices. The calculation of the plant services costs attributed to general administration and included in the pool is standardized and automated using the percentage of salaries and benefits relating to general administration as proxy for the percentage of square footage occupied by general administration.

#### A. Salaries and Benefits - Other General Administration and Centralized Data Processing
1. Salaries and benefits paid through payroll (Funds 01, 09, and 62, objects 1000-3999 except 3701-3702)  
   (Functions 7200-7700, goals 0000 and 9000)  
   **22,457,405.00**

2. Contracted general administrative positions not paid through payroll  
   a. Enter the costs, if any, of general administrative positions performing services ON SITE but paid through a contract, rather than through payroll, in functions 7200-7700, goals 0000 and 9000, Object 5800.  
   **0.00**

3. If an amount is entered on Line A2a, provide the title, duties, and approximate FTE of each general administrative position paid through a contract. Retain supporting documentation in case of audit.

#### B. Salaries and Benefits - All Other Activities
1. Salaries and benefits paid through payroll (Funds 01, 09, and 62, objects 1000-3999 except 3701-3702)  
   (Functions 1000-6999, 7100-7480, & 8100-8400; Functions 7200-7700, all goals except 0000 & 9000)  
   **524,698,659.00**

#### C. Percentage of Plant Services Costs Attributable to General Administration  
(Line A1 plus Line A2a, divided by Line B1; zero if negative) (See Part III, Lines A5 and A6)  
**4.28%**

---

### Part II - Adjustments for Employment Separation Costs
When an employee separates from service, the local educational agency (LEA) may incur costs associated with the separation in addition to the employee's salary and benefits. These additional costs can be categorized as "normal" or "abnormal" or mass separation costs.

Normal separation costs include items such as pay for accumulated unused leave or routine severance pay authorized by governing board policy. Normal separation costs are not allowable as direct costs to federal programs, but are allowable as indirect costs. State programs may have similar restrictions. Where federal or state program guidelines required that the LEA charge an employee's normal separation costs to an unrestricted resource rather than to the restricted program in which the employee worked, the LEA may identify and enter these costs on Line A for inclusion in the indirect cost pool.

Abnormal or mass separation costs are those costs resulting from actions taken by an LEA to influence employees to terminate their employment earlier than they normally would have. Abnormal or mass separation costs include retirement incentives such as Golden Handshake or severance packages negotiated to effect termination. Abnormal or mass separation costs may not be charged to federal programs as other direct costs or indirect costs. Where an LEA paid abnormal or mass separation costs on behalf of positions in general administrative functions included in the indirect cost pool, the LEA must identify and enter these costs on Line B for exclusion from the pool.

#### A. Normal Separation Costs (optional)  
Enter any normal separation costs paid on behalf of employees of restricted state or federal programs that were charged to an unrestricted resource (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 1000-6999 or 8100-8400 rather than to the restricted program. These costs will be moved in Part III from base costs to the indirect cost pool. Retain supporting documentation.

#### B. Abnormal or Mass Separation Costs (required)  
Enter any abnormal or mass separation costs paid on behalf of general administrative positions charged to unrestricted resources (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 7200-7700. These costs will be moved in Part III from the indirect cost pool to base costs. If none, enter zero.

### Part III - Indirect Cost Rate Calculation (Funds 01, 09, and 62, unless indicated otherwise)

#### A. Indirect Costs
1. Other General Administration, less portion charged to restricted resources or specific goals  
   (Functions 7200-7600, objects 1000-9999, minus Line B9)

**B. Carry-forward adjustment from prior year(s)**  
1. Carry-forward adjustment from the second prior year  
741,943.71  
2. Carry-forward adjustment deferred from prior year(s), if any  
0.00  

**C. Carry-forward adjustment for under- or over-recovery in the current year**  
1. Under-recovery: Part III, Line A8, plus carry-forward adjustment from prior years, minus (approved indirect cost rate (4.0%) times Part III, Line B19); zero if negative  
5,316,680.54  
2. Over-recovery: Part III, Line A8, plus carry-forward adjustment from prior years, minus the lesser of (approved indirect cost rate (4.0%) times Part III, Line B19) or the highest rate used to recover costs from any program (4.0%) times Part III, Line B19); zero if positive  
0.00  

**D. Preliminary carry-forward adjustment (Line C1 or C2)**  
5,316,680.54  

**E. Optional allocation of negative carry-forward adjustment over one year**  
Where a negative carry-forward adjustment causes the proposed approved rate to fall below zero or would reduce the rate at which the LEA could recover indirect costs to such an extent that it would cause the LEA significant fiscal harm, the LEA may request that the carry-forward adjustment be allocated over more than one year. Where allocation of a negative carry-forward adjustment over more than one year does not resolve a negative rate, the CDE will work with the LEA on a case-by-case basis to establish an approved rate.  
1. Preliminary proposed approved rate (Part III, Line D) if direct negative carry-forward  
not applicable  
2. Preliminary proposed approved rate (Part III, Line D) if one-half of negative carry-forward adjustment is applied to the current year calculation and the remainder is deferred to one or more future years:  
not applicable  
3. Preliminary proposed approved rate (Part III, Line D) if one-third of negative carry-forward adjustment is applied to the current year calculation and the remainder is deferred to one or more future years:

1c. **NOT MET** - The projected transfers out of the general fund have changed by more than the standard for one or more of the budget or subsequent two fiscal years. Identify the amount(s) transferred, by fund, and whether transfers are ongoing or one-time in nature. If ongoing, explain the district's plan, with timeframes, for reducing or eliminating the transfers.

**Explanation:**  
The reduction in 2024-25 is due to one-time funds in 2023-24 that were transferred to the building fund for a project along with funds transferred to the Child Nutrition Fund to provide food to various programs and ELO-P provide funds to Child Development for after school programs. In 2025-26 the reduction is to a reduced need for funds to be contributed to the Child Dev. development funds.

1d. **NO** - There are no capital projects that may impact the general fund operational budget.

**Project Information:**  
*(required if YES)*

![Education Protection Account (EPA)](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Education+Protection+Account+(EPA))

The Education Protection Account (EPA) provides local educational agencies (LEAs) with general purpose state aid funding pursuant to Proposition 30, the Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act of 2012, approved by the voters on November 6, 2012. Proposition 55 (2016), continues the use of EPA. The EPA funding is a component of an LEA's or Charter School’s total Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) revenue. Proposition 55 takes effect on January 1, 2018, and remains in effect through December 31, 2030.

The revenues generated from Propositions 30 and 55 are deposited into the EPA and a corresponding reduction is made to the district’s or charter school’s LCFF revenue. For 2024-25, the reduction is approximately 24% of the total LCFF funding. The district began receiving EPA payments quarterly in Fiscal Year 2013–14.

### Funding Before Proposition 30
- Local Taxes: 29%
- State Aid: 71%

### Funding After Proposition 30
- Local Taxes: 29%
- State Aid: 47%
- EPA: 24%

Proposition 30 requires that each LEA shall have sole authority to determine how the moneys received from the Education Protection Account are spent in the school or schools within its jurisdiction, provided, however, that the appropriate governing board or body shall make these spending determinations in open session of a public meeting of the governing board or body and shall not use any of the funds from the Education Protection Account for salaries or benefits of administrators or for any other administrative costs. An LEA may allocate the EPA entitlement entirely to one program for expenditure.

Propositions 30 and 55 require all districts, counties, and charter schools to report on their Web sites an accounting of how much money was received from the EPA and how that money was spent. District EPA information for previous years can be found by selecting the Budget Info link on the District’s website.

Listed on the next page is the Education Protection Account Expenditure plan listing how the moneys received from the Education Protection Account are proposed to be spent in 2024-25.

# GLOSSARY

This glossary provides definitions of current terms used in school business documents.

**Accounts Payable**  
Amounts due and owed to private persons, business firms, governmental units, or others for goods received and/or services rendered prior to the end of the fiscal year. Includes amounts billed but not paid. Does not include amounts due to other funds of the same school district.

**Accounts Receivable**  
Amounts due and owed the district from private persons, business firms, governmental units, or others for goods or services rendered by the district prior to the end of the fiscal year. Includes amounts billed but not received. Does not include amounts due from other funds of the same school district.

**Apportionments**  
State aid given to a school district or county office of education. Apportionments are calculated three times for each school year. The First Principal Apportionment (P-1) is calculated in February of the school year corresponding to the P-1 ADA (See Attendance Reports); the Second Principal Apportionment (P-2) is calculated in June corresponding to the P-2 ADA; and the annual recalculation of the apportionment is made in February following the school year and is based on P-2 ADA, except for programs where the annual count of ADA is used.

**Available Balance**  
Budgeted amount less expenditures to date and encumbrances.

**Average Daily Attendance (ADA)**  
The student days of actual attendance divided by the number of days school was in session. A student attending every day of school would equal one ADA. ADA is usually lower than enrollment due to factors such as students moving, dropping out, or staying home due to illness. The state uses a school district’s ADA to determine its general purpose revenue and other funding.

**Bond Measure**  
Bonds allow school districts to borrow funds to pay for a large capital investment—much as a person borrows to purchase a home. Districts can choose to seek bond passage with either a two-thirds vote or a 55% vote which requires greater accountability measures. The principal and interest are repaid by local property owners through an increase in property taxes. A simple majority of state voters may approve a state general obligation bond, which is repaid by state taxes and has no impact on property tax rates.

**Bonded Indebtedness**  
An obligation incurred by the sale of bonds for acquisition of school facilities or other capital expenditures. Since 1986, districts have been able to levy a local property tax to amortize bonded indebtedness provided the taxes are approved by a two-thirds vote of the electorate.

Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board discuss and approve the plan for Arts, Music, and Instructional Materials (AMIM) Discretionary Block Grant funding.  

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:  
On June 30, 2022, Governor Gavin Newsom approved AB 181. The bill established the Arts, Music, and Instructional Materials (AMIM) Discretionary Block Grant. On September 27, 2022, Governor Newsom approved AB 185, which revised the Arts, Music, and Instructional Materials Discretionary Block Grant. The grant allocates $3,560,885,000 to local educational agencies (LEA) for five purposes enumerated in Section 134(a) of Chapter 52 of the Statutes of 2022, which may be briefly summarized as: (1) obtaining standards-aligned professional development and instructional materials for specified subject areas; (2) obtaining professional development and instructional materials for improving school climate; (3) developing diverse, culturally relevant and multilingual school library book collections; (4) operational costs, including retirement and health care cost increases; and (5) COVID-19-related costs necessary to keep pupils and staff safe and schools open for in-person instruction.  

Section 134(c) of AB 185 notes that funding appropriated pursuant to this section shall be available for encumbrance through the 2025-26 fiscal year. LEAs are encouraged, but not required, to proportionally use resources pursuant to this section for the purposes noted in paragraphs (1) to (5), inclusive, of subdivision (a) and to support arts and music education programs.  

The district received $21,824,824 in one-time AMIM funding.

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT**  
**AGENDA ITEM:** I.7  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**MEETING DATE:** 06/25/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Middle School Boundary Adjustments (Camarada) – 8:25 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Operations  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
Action: The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt Resolution No.4142, adjusting the attendance boundaries for Arden Middle School, Arcade Middle School, Katherine Johnson Middle School, Starr King K-8 and Winston Churchill Middle School; selecting map no. 3 for the new middle school boundaries within the western region of the district; and approving a notice of exemption regarding the boundary change as provided for by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
District staff in reviewing financial and enrollment data, recommended that the board examine the possibility of adjusting the attendance boundaries at specific middle school campuses as part of an overall plan to adapt to enrollment growth and maintain long term stability in the district. Upon board direction to examine this possibility, staff began the process of soliciting feedback from the community and analyzing the impact of a boundary adjustment on the district, its students, staff, and the community as a whole.  

Neither federal nor state law specifically addresses a change in school attendance boundaries. Generally, the Education Code permits the Board to act in any manner that does not violate the law and to expend funds as necessary to meet District needs. (Ed. Code sections 35160 and 35160.1.) The authority of school boards extends to setting student assignment policies and to determining geographic attendance zones. (American Civil Rights Foundation v. Berkeley Unified School Dist., supra, 172 Cal.App.4th at p. 216.) Under this authority, the Board has power, “in the exercise of reasonable discretion, to establish school attendance zones within the district, to determine the area that a particular school shall serve, and to require the students in that area to attend that school.” (Jackson v. Pasadena City School District (1963) 59 Cal. 2nd 876, 879.)  

The district’s Board Policy 5116 established procedures for setting, modifying and reviewing its school attendance boundaries. To establish or modify school attendance boundaries, the superintendent or designee must consider the following factors before making a recommendation to the board for boundary adjustments:  
1. School enrollment data, including declining enrollment patterns;  
2. Facility capacity and design, including potential commercial and residential developments;  
3. School feeder patterns, including maintaining, to the extent practicable, continuity of student attendance;  
4. Federal, state, or court mandates;  
5. Community input;  
6. Student safety;  
7. Transportation capacity;  
8. Community and neighborhood identity;  
9. Geographic features of the district, including traffic patterns;  
10. Educational programs, such as magnet schools and charter schools;  
11. Consistency between municipal boundaries and high school boundaries; and  
12. Other factors.  

District staff, with board direction, convened a committee of members comprised of principals, facility planners, consultants, and district staff to study the impact of the boundary adjustments and the factors laid out above. The committee also conducted various outreach events to solicit additional feedback from members of the public that may be impacted by the boundary adjustments.  

The specific boundary changes are depicted in accompanying attachment number three. These boundary changes would be effective at the start of the 2025-2026 school year.  

**1159**
<!-- Page 1160 -->
Furthermore, as a change in attendance boundaries may be considered a project for the purposes of the California Environmental Quality Act, staff also recommends the board adopt the attached Notice of Exemption providing that the boundary adjustment is exempt from environmental review as it will not have a significant impact on the environment.

![Document](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Document+Image)  

WHEREAS, the adjustment of attendance boundaries (“Project”) is a project subject to the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000, et seq., (“CEQA”)) and its implementing regulations (Cal. Code of Regs., tit. 14, §15000 et seq., “CEQA Guidelines”), except that the Project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21080.18 and CEQA Guideline 15314 related to minor additions to existing schools; and  

WHEREAS, the Project will not result in any physical changes to facilities; and  

WHEREAS, the Project is statutorily exempt under Public Resources Code section 21080.18 and CEQA Guideline 15314; and  

WHEREAS, the Project does not involve any of the following and so is eligible for an exemption as described above under State CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2:  
a) The cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, which over time are significant;  
b) An activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances;  
c) A project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings or similar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway;  
d) A hazardous waste site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code; and  
e) A project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource; and  

WHEREAS, the CEQA Guidelines also exempt from further CEQA review those activities that are covered by the general rule that CEQA applies only to projects which have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment. Where it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment, the activity is not subject to CEQA (the “Common Sense Exemption”); and  

WHEREAS, upon a determination that the Project is exempt from CEQA, the District is entitled to file a Notice of Exemption with the County Clerk pursuant to California Code of Regulations, Title 14, section 15062.

AGENDA ITEM: 1.8  
MEETING DATE: 06/25/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Safe Schools Program (Allen) – 8:30 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Community Relations  
**ACTION REQUESTED:** Report regarding the operation of the district's Safe Schools program.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The district's Safe Schools program has operated for more than three decades with the goal of growing safe and supportive learning environments. The program has been adapted over time to meet changing needs.

For 2024-25, the district is adding a community safety specialist to the team bringing the total to nine. Each specialist is assigned a high school and its feeder schools to support in building safe and supportive learning environments. This is accomplished through relationship building, training and supporting sites during critical incidents. The program works in close partnership with other district departments to leverage resources and maintains close ties with local law enforcement officials to develop mutually supportive solutions to concerns.

Program focuses for 2024-25 include expanding training for secondary school sites, increasing student access to reporting safety concerns, implementing improved practices at sites receiving fencing upgrades and conducting biennial campus vulnerability assessments.
