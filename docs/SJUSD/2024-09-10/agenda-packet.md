### AGENDA ITEM: F.4  
### MEETING DATE: 09/10/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Gann Appropriation Limits for 2023-2024 and 2024-2025  
**DEPARTMENT:** Fiscal Services  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board adopt Resolution No. 4148, approving Gann Appropriation Limits for 2023-2024 and 2024-2025.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
This limit on government spending, which became known as Gann Appropriation Limits or simply Gann Limits, applies not only to the state of California, but also to cities, counties, special districts, as well as to school districts and county offices of education (ref. Article XIII B of the State Constitution).  

The base year of Gann Limit calculations was 1978-1979, the fiscal year before Proposition 4 was enacted. In each year since, a school agency's Gann Limit is increased for both inflation and population. Inflation for these purposes is currently the annual percentage change in California per capita personal income. For school agencies, change in ADA is used as a measurement of the change in population.  

School agencies are required to perform Gann Limit calculations by the State Constitution.  

In accordance with Education Code Section 42132, the board is required to adopt its Gann Appropriation Limits each year and send it to the Sacramento County Office of Education. As of June 30, 2023, the district is in compliance with its Gann Limit.  

**ATTACHMENT(S):**  
1. Resolution No. 4148 GANN Limit  
2. Form GANN  

**BOARD COMMITTEE ACTION/COMMENT:**  
N/A  

**PREVIOUS STAFF/BOARD ACTION:**  
Superintendent's Cabinet: 09/03/2024  

**FISCAL IMPACT:**  
The Gann Limit calculations are presented below:  

| GANN Limit | Appropriations subject to limit |  
|------------|-------------------------------|  
| 2023-2024  | $ 318,158,765.11              | $ 318,158,765.11 |

WHEREAS, the district must establish a revised Gann Limit for the 2023-2024 fiscal year and a projected Gann Limit for the 2024-2025 fiscal year in accordance with the provisions of Article XIII-B and applicable statutory law;  

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that this board does provide public notice that the attached calculations and documentation of the Gann Limits for the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 fiscal years are made in accordance with applicable constitutional and statutory law; and  

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this Board does hereby declare that the appropriations in the budget for the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 fiscal years do not exceed the limitations imposed by Proposition 4; and,

# OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTION

## FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
The San Juan Unified School District financial status is comprised of three major components: (1) Fund Balance (Ending and Beginning Balance); (2) Revenues; and (3) Expenditures. This document reflects unaudited actual figures for 2023-24, and the revised budget for 2024-25. Multi-year projections for 2025-26 and 2026-27 will be published with the First Interim Report in December.

## MISSION
We partner with our San Juan Unified community in setting high expectations for academic achievement rooted in equity and unity to create supportive learning experiences in which all students, families and staff can excel and thrive.

## CORE VALUES
- **Belonging**  
  We create a community that cultivates welcoming and inclusive environments with genuine respect for our diversity of cultures, identities and abilities.

- **Relevance**  
  We design experiences and environments where each learner can explore and apply skills and knowledge that align with evolving careers and workplaces.

- **Voice**  
  We honor and affirm all voices of our school community and encourage them to share their perspectives to help improve and shape what we do and how we do it.

- **Social and Emotional Intelligence**  
  We build a culture that teaches, models and applies social and emotional intelligence in all interactions with each other.

- **Resilience**  
  We create nurturing schools and programs that inspire each learner to continue to persevere, gain strength and develop the confidence to excel beyond challenges.

- **Championing**  
  We support and advocate for those in our San Juan Unified community who are disproportionately impacted or marginalized by circumstances beyond their control.

- **Innovation**  
  We embrace and encourage creative thinking and learning environments that transform ideas into actionable solutions.

# Part I - General Administrative Share of Plant Services Costs
California's indirect cost plan allows that the general administrative costs in the indirect cost pool may include that portion of plant services costs (maintenance and operations costs and facilities rents and leases costs) attributable to the general administrative offices. The calculation of the plant services costs attributed to general administration and included in the pool is standardized and automated using the percentage of salaries and benefits relating to general administration as proxy for the percentage of square footage occupied by general administration.

## A. Salaries and Benefits - Other General Administration and Centralized Data Processing
1. Salaries and benefits paid through payroll (Funds 01, 09, and 62, objects 1000-3999 except 3701-3702)  
   (Functions 7200-7700, goals 0000 and 9000)  
   **Total:** $25,299,970.28

   a. Enter the costs, if any, of general administrative positions performing services ON SITE but paid through a contract, rather than through payroll in functions 7200-7700, goals 0000 and 9000, Object 5800.

   b. If an amount is entered on Line A2a, provide the title, duties, and approximate FTE of each general administrative position paid through a contract. Retain supporting documentation in case of audit.

## B. Salaries and Benefits - All Other Activities
1. Salaries and benefits paid through payroll (Funds 01, 09, and 62, objects 1000-3999 except 3701-3702)  
   (Functions 1000-6999, 7100-7480, & 8100-8400; Functions 7200-7700, all goals except 0000 & 9000)  
   **Total:** $505,881,793.80

## C. Percentage of Plant Services Costs Attributable to General Administration  
(Line A1 plus Line A2a, divided by Line B1; zero if negative) (See Part III, Lines A5 and A6)  
**Percentage:** 5.00%

# Part II - Adjustments for Employment Separation Costs
When an employee separates from service, the local educational agency (LEA) may incur costs associated with the separation in addition to the employee's regular salary and benefits for the final pay period. These additional costs can be categorized as "normal" or "abnormal" or mass* separation costs.

Normal separation costs include items such as pay for accumulated unused leave or routine severance pay authorized by governing board policy. Normal separation costs are not allowable as direct costs to federal programs, but are allowable as indirect costs. State programs may have similar restrictions. Where federal or state program guidelines required that the LEA charge an employee's normal separation costs to an unrestricted resource rather than to the restricted program in which the employee worked, the LEA may identify and enter these costs on Line A for inclusion in the indirect cost pool.

Abnormal or mass separation costs are those costs resulting from actions taken by an LEA to influence employees to terminate their employment earlier than they normally would have. Abnormal or mass separation costs include retirement incentives such as a Golden Handshake or severance packages negotiated to effect termination. Abnormal or mass separation costs may not be charged to federal programs as other direct costs or indirect costs. Where an LEA paid abnormal or mass separation costs on behalf of positions in general administrative functions included in the indirect cost pool, the LEA must identify and enter these costs on Line B for exclusion from the pool.

## A. Normal Separation Costs (optional)  
Enter any normal separation costs paid on behalf of employees of restricted state or federal programs that were charged to an unrestricted resource (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 1000-6999 or 8100-8400 rather than to the restricted program. These costs will be moved in Part III from the indirect cost pool to base costs. If none, enter zero.  
**Total:** 0.00

## B. Abnormal or Mass Separation Costs (required)  
Enter any abnormal or mass separation costs paid on behalf of general administrative positions charged to unrestricted resources (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 7200-7700. These costs will be moved in Part III from the indirect cost pool to base costs. If none, enter zero.  
**Total:** 0.00

# Part III - Indirect Cost Rate Calculation (Funds 01, 09, and 62, unless indicated otherwise)
## A. Indirect Costs
1. Other General Administration, less portion charged to restricted resources or specific goals  
   (Functions 7200-7600, objects 1000-5999, minus Line B9)  
   **Total:** $15,559,372.66

2. Centralized Data Processing, less portion charged to restricted resources or specific goals  
   (Function 7700, objects 1000-5999, minus Line B10)  
   **Total:** $11,363,876.18

the need for LEAs to file amended federal reports when their actual indirect costs vary from the estimated indirect costs on which the approved rate was based.  
Where the ratio of indirect costs incurred in the current year is less than the estimated ratio of indirect costs on which the approved rate for use in the current year was based, the carry-forward adjustment is limited by using either the approved rate times current year base costs, or the highest rate actually used to recover costs from any programs times current year base costs, if the highest rate used was less than the approved rate. Rates used to recover costs from programs are displayed in Exhibit A.  

A. Indirect costs incurred in the current year (Part III, Line A8)

C. Carry-forward adjustment for under- or over-recovery in the current year  
1. Under-recovery: Part III, Line A8, plus carry-forward adjustment from prior years, minus (approved indirect cost rate (4.96%) times Part III, Line B19); zero if negative  
5,818,097.23  
2. Over-recovery: Part III, Line A8, plus carry-forward adjustment from prior years, minus the lesser of (approved indirect cost rate (4.96%) times Part III, Line B19) or (the highest rate used to recover costs from any program (4.96%) times Part III, Line B19); zero if positive  
0.00  

D. Preliminary carry-forward adjustment (Line C1 or C2)  
5,818,097.23  

E. Optional allocation of negative carry-forward adjustment over more than one year  
Where a negative carry-forward adjustment causes the proposed approved rate to fall below zero or would reduce the rate at which the LEA could recover indirect costs to such an extent that it would cause the LEA significant fiscal harm, the LEA may request that the carry-forward adjustment be allocated over more than one year. Where allocation of a negative carry-forward adjustment over more than one year does not resolve a negative rate, the CDE will work with the LEA on a case-by-case basis to establish an approved rate.  
1. Preliminary proposed approved rate (Part III, Line D) if either negative carry-forward adjustment is not applicable  
2. Preliminary proposed approved rate (Part III, Line D) if one-half of negative carry-forward adjustment is applied to the current year calculation and the remainder is deferred to one or more future years:  
not applicable  
3. Preliminary proposed approved rate (Part III, Line D) if one-third of negative carry-forward adjustment is applied to the current year calculation and the remainder is deferred to one or more future years:  
not applicable

**2023-24 Actuals vs. LEA Maintenance of Effort Comparison Year**  
**LEA Maintenance of Effort Calculation (LMC-A)**  
**EBADDFPNP(2023-24)**  

**SELPA:** San Juan Unified (CN)  

This form is used to check maintenance of effort (MOE) for an LEA, whether the LEA is a member of a SELPA or is a single-LEA SELPA. If a member of a SELPA, submit this form together with the 2023-24 Expenditures by LEA (ELC-Y) and the 2022-23 Expenditures by LEA (ELC-Y) to the CDE.

Per the federal Subsequent Years Rule, in order to determine the required level of effort, the LEA must look back to the last fiscal year in which the LEA maintained effort using the same method by which it is currently establishing the compliance standard. To meet the requirement of the Subsequent Years LMC-A worksheet that has been revised to make changes to sections 3.A.1, 3.A.2, 3.B.1, and 3.B.2, the revised sections allow the LEA to compare the 2023-24 expenditures to the most recent fiscal year that the LEA used that method, which is the comparison year. To ensure the LEA is comparing 2023-24 expenditures to the appropriate comparison year, the LEA is required to complete the Subsequent Years Tracking (SYT) worksheet with their LMC-A worksheet. The SYT worksheet tracks the result for each of the four methods back to FY 2011-12, which is the baseline year for LEA MOE calculations established by the California Department of Education Programs. The SYT worksheet is available at http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/se/as/documents/subexemptworksh.xls

The LEA is only required to pass one of the tests to meet the MOE requirement. However, the LEA is required to show results for all four methods. These results are necessary both for historical purposes and for the possibility that the LEA may want, or need, to switch methods in future years.

---

**SECTION 1**  
**Exempt Reduction Under 34 CFR Section 300.204**  
If your LEA determines that a reduction in expenditures occurred as a result of one or more of the following conditions, you may calculate a reduction to the required MOE standard. Reductions may apply to combined state and local MOE standard, local only MOE standard, or both. If the LEA meets one of the conditions below, the LEA must complete and include the IDEA MOE Exemption Worksheet available at: http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/se/as/documents/leamoexempworksh.xls

1. Voluntary departure, by retirement or otherwise, or departure for just cause, of special education or related services personnel.  
2. A decrease in the enrollment of children with disabilities.  
3. The termination of the obligation of the agency to provide a program of special education to a particular child with a disability that is an exceptionally costly program, as determined by the SEA, because the child:  
   a. Has left the jurisdiction of the agency;  
   b. Has reached the age at which the obligation of the agency to provide free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the child has terminated; or  
   c. No longer needs the program of special education.  
4. The termination of costly expenditures for long-term purchases, such as the acquisition of equipment or the construction of school facilities.  
5. The assumption of cost by the high cost fund operated by the SEA under 34 CFR Sec. 300.704(c).  

Provide the condition number, if any, to be used in the calculation below:  

| Total exempt reductions | State and Local | Local Only |

**SECTION 2**  
**Reduction to MOE Requirement Under IDEA, Section 613 (a)(2)(C) (34 CFR Sec. 300.205)**  
IMPORTANT NOTE: Only LEAs that have a "meets requirement" compliance determination and that are not found significantly disproportionate for the current year are eligible to use this option to reduce the MOE requirement.

Up to 50% of the increase in IDEA Part B Section 611 funding in current year compared with prior year may be used to reduce the required level of state and local expenditures. This option is available only if the LEA used or will use the freed up funds for activities authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. Also, the amount of Part B funds used for early intervening services (34 CFR 300.206) will count toward the maximum amount by which the LEA may reduce its MOE requirement under this exception [PL 108-446].

![San Juan Unified - Special Education Maintenance of Effort](https://www.example.com/image.png)

**San Juan Unified**  
**Sacramento County**  
**SELPA:** San Juan Unified (CN)  

This form is used to check maintenance of effort (MOE) for an LEA, whether the LEA is a member of a SELPA or is a single-LEA SELPA. If a member of a SELPA, submit this form together with the 2024-25 Budget by LEA (LB-8) and the 2024-25 Expenditures by LEA (LE-6) to the SELPA AU. If a single-LEA SELPA, submit the forms to the CDE.

For the federal Subsequent Years Rule, in order to determine eligibility for federal funds, the LEA must look back to the last fiscal year in which the LEA maintained effort using the same method by which it is currently establishing eligibility standards. To meet the requirements of the Subsequent Years Rule, the revised sections allow the LEA to compare the 2024-25 budgeted expenditures to the most recent fiscal year the LEA met MOE using that method, which is the comparison year. To ensure the LEA is comparing 2024-25 budgeted expenditures to the appropriate comparison year, the LEA is required to complete the Subsequent Years Tracking (SYT) worksheet that reflects the result for each of the four methods back to FY 2011-12, which is the baseline year for LEA MOE calculations established by the Office of Special Education Programs. The SYT worksheet is available at: http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/se/sa/documents/usemoewksht.xls.

There are four methods that the LEA can use to demonstrate the eligibility standard. They are: (1) combined state and local expenditures; (2) combined state and local expenditures on a per capita basis; (3) local expenditures only; and (4) local expenditures only on a per capita basis.

The LEA is only required to pass one of the tests to meet the MOE requirement. However, the LEA is required to show results for all four methods. These results are necessary both for historical purposes and for the possibility that the LEA may want, or need, to switch methods in future years.

---

**SECTION 1**  
**Exempt Reduction Under 34 CFR Section 300.204**  
If your LEA determines that a reduction in expenditures occurred as a result of one or more of the following conditions, you may calculate a reduction to the required MOE standard. Reductions may apply to combined state and local MOE standard, local only MOE standard, or both. If the LEA meets one of the conditions below, the LEA must complete and include the IDEA MOE Exemption Worksheet available at: http://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/se/sa/documents/amexemptwksht.xls.

1. Voluntary departure, by retirement or otherwise, or departure for just cause, of special education or related services personnel.  
2. A decrease in the enrollment of children with disabilities.  
3. The termination of the obligation of the agency to provide a program of special education to a particular child with a disability that is an exceptionally costly program, as determined by the SEA, because the child:  
   a. Has left the jurisdiction of the agency;  
   b. Has reached the age at which the obligation of the agency to provide free appropriate public education (FAPE) to the child has terminated; or  
   c. No longer needs the program of special education.  
4. The termination of costly expenditures for long-term purchases, such as the acquisition of equipment or the construction of school facilities.  
5. The assumption of cost by the high cost fund operated by the SEA under 34 CFR Sec. 300.704(c).  

Provide the condition number, if any, to be used in the calculation below:  
______________________________________________________________________________

**Total exempt reductions**  
State and Local: 0.00  
Local Only: 0.00

**SECTION 2**  
**Reduction to MOE Requirement Under IDEA, Section 613 (a)(2)(C) (34 CFR Sec. 300.205)**  
IMPORTANT NOTE: Only LEAs that have a "meets requirement" compliance determination and that are not found significantly disproportionate for the current year are eligible to use this option to reduce their MOE requirement.

Up to 50% of the increase in IDEA Part B Section 611 funding in current year compared with prior year may be used to reduce the required level of state and local expenditures. This option is available only if the LEA used or will use the freed up funds for activities authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. Also, the amount of Part B funds used for early intervening services (34 CFR 300.226) will count toward the maximum amount by which the LEA may reduce its MOE requirement under this exception [D. 108-446].

| **State and Local** | **Local Only** |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Current year funding (IDEA Section 611 Local Assistance Grant Award - Resource 3310) | 10,988,245.00 |
| Less: Prior year's funding (IDEA Section 611 Local Assistance Grant Award - Resource 3310) | 10,988,245.00 |
| Increase in funding (if difference is positive) | 0.00 |
| Maximum available for MOE reduction (50% of increase in funding) | 0.00 (a) |
| Current year funding (IDEA Section 619 - Resource 3315) | 439,934.00 |
| Maximum available for early intervening services (EIS) (15% of current year funding - Resources 3310 and 3315) | 1,714,226.85 (b) |

**If (b) is greater than (a).**  
Enter portion to set aside for EIS (cannot exceed line (b), Maximum available for EIS) | (c)  
Available for MOE reduction (line (a) minus line (c), zero if negative) | 0.00 (d)  
Enter portion used to reduce MOE requirement (cannot exceed line (d), Available for MOE reduction). |  

**THIS SECTION IS NOT APPLICABLE!**  
If (b) is less than (a).  
Enter portion used to reduce MOE requirement (first column cannot exceed line (a), Maximum available for MOE reduction, second and third columns cannot exceed (e), Portion used to reduce MOE requirement). |  
Available to set aside for EIS (line (b) minus line (c), zero if negative) | 1,714,226.85 (f)  

**Note:** If your LEA exercises the authority under 34 CFR 300.205(a) to reduce the MOE requirement, the LEA must list the activities (which are authorized under the ESEA) paid with the freed up funds.

![SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AGENDA ITEM: H.3 BOARD OF EDUCATION MEETING DATE: 09/10/2024](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**SUBJECT:** New Board Policy 1160 Political Processes (Thigpen) - 7:55 p.m.  
**DEPARTMENT:** Labor Relations and Government Affairs  
**ACTION REQUESTED:** Discussion; The superintendent is recommending that the board review new board policy 1160 Political Processes. Action anticipated: 09/24/2024.  

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
On Aug. 27, 2024, the Board of Education received a presentation regarding the district’s ongoing government relations work and staff recommendations for new ways the district can play a role in strengthening public policy that impacts its schools, staff, and students. The board directed staff to draft a new board policy that communicates the intent and purpose for advocacy and that requires the board to adopt legislative priorities to guide advocacy work.

The draft Board Policy 1160: Political Processes presented here is modeled after similar versions of a policy that have been adopted by large school districts locally and across the state, in alignment with California School Boards Association (CSBA) recommendations and Government Code 53060.5. This draft policy affirms the board’s authority, via the superintendent or designee, to engage in advocacy at the local, state, and federal levels. It requires the board to adopt overarching legislative priorities before each legislative session, principles that are aligned with the district’s strategic plan and are intended to define focus areas for the staff’s advocacy work, such as determining whether to take or communicate a formal position on pending legislation. Additionally, this draft board policy clarifies the roles between the board and superintendent, or designee, when engaging in advocacy.

## Policy 1160: Political Processes  
**Original Adopted Date:** ___________  
**Status:** ________

The Governing Board has a responsibility to actively advocate fiscal and public policy that supports the district's schools and students. The Board shall be proactive in defining the district's legislative priorities based on the district's strategic plan and the needs of the district and community. The Board's advocacy efforts shall be conducted in accordance with legal requirements.

### Legislation

The Board's responsibility as an advocate for the district is to establish legislative priorities based on the district’s strategic plan. The Superintendent or designee shall work to establish and maintain ongoing relationships with elected officials, community leaders, and the media in order to communicate district positions and concerns.

Before each legislative session commences, the Board and Superintendent shall develop a set of legislative priorities that will define focus areas for district advocacy efforts. Based on these priorities, the Superintendent or designee may implement advocacy strategies including but not limited to: communicating positions on specific legislation, regulations, or budget proposals, development of key messages and talking points, public testimony, and outreach to the media. In order to strengthen legislative advocacy efforts, the Superintendent or designee may work with organizations and coalitions and may join associations whose representatives lobby on behalf of their members in accordance with Government Code 53060.5.

The district shall inform the Board about its advocacy activities. The district may provide to the community fair and impartial information about legislative issues affecting schools and students. However, informational materials about legislation shall not urge the public to lobby the legislature, Governor, or state agencies on behalf of the district.

As necessary, the Superintendent or designee may bring to the board for discussion and action draft legislative or regulatory proposals (including but not limited to district-sponsored legislation) which serve the district's interests.

### Board Member Request for Action or Information on Legislation

Requests by individual Board members shall follow the procedures established in the board-adopted Governance Handbook.

# Academic Focus Areas

While each school is unique, we are committed to providing a high-quality education for every student that includes:

- A challenging, standards-based academic program at every school
- Additional supports for students who require extra assistance
- Enrichment opportunities and programs

Welcoming schools that support the social and emotional needs of our students form the foundation for academic excellence. We recognize this is built through continuous improvement of intentional collaborative efforts that are focused on the following:

1. **Connected School Communities:** Caring staff actively build community relationships, identify assets and needs and connect students and families with resources to help them access the best opportunities our schools have to offer.
2. **Healthy Environments for Social-Emotional Growth:** Staff will cultivate inclusive, safe, equitable, culturally responsive and healthy environments by integration of social and emotional learning to ensure essential student development.
3. **Engaging Academic Programs:** Staff educators will engage and support each student in a challenging and broad course of study that builds skills, knowledge and experiences preparing all to be critical thinkers who communicate effectively, collaborate and are civic-minded.
4. **Clear Pathways to Bright Futures:** Our whole school community engages each student in discovering their limitless potential, and through coordinated efforts, prepares them for college, career and bright futures filled with opportunities.

# District Overview

Created in 1960 with the merger of six school districts, San Juan Unified School District has a rich tradition in providing all students with the opportunity for academic success and achievement.

The district serves a 75-square-mile area covering the communities of Arden-Arcade, Carmichael, Citrus Heights, Fair Oaks, Gold River and Orangevale.

Today, San Juan Unified is the 10th largest school district in California with an expenditure budget of more than $500 million used to employ more than 5,000 individuals and to educate more than 45,000 students in our early learning, TK-12 and adult programs. More than 10,000 additional K-12 students are served in independent charter schools within the district.

The district consists of 33 elementary schools, eight K-8 schools, nine middle schools, nine comprehensive high schools, three special-education centers, three alternative schools, one adult-education center, two Early Childhood Education centers and one dependent charter.

The student population is diverse. During the 2022-2023 school year, the district's ethnic/racial makeup was: 0.6 percent American Indian or Alaskan Native, 25.7 percent Hispanic/Latino, 6.9 percent African American, 47 percent White, 10.6 percent Asian/Asian American, 0.7 percent Pacific Islander, .9 percent Filipino and 7.6 percent multi-race.

# Roles and responsibilities of board members and the superintendent

## Board Roles
The role of the board is to provide each student with an education of the highest possible quality within the limits of financial support provided by the State of California. To accomplish this, board members are responsible for five roles identified by the California School Boards Association (CSBA):

- **Setting the direction** for the district by involving parents/guardians, community, students and staff, while focusing on student learning and achievement.

- **Establishing an effective and efficient structure** by employing the superintendent, developing and adopting policies, establishing academic expectations and adopting curriculum and instructional materials, establishing budget priorities and adopting the budget, providing safe and adequate facilities to support student learning, and setting parameters for negotiations with employee organizations and ratifying collective bargaining agreements.

- **Providing support to the superintendent and staff** by following standards of responsible governance, making decisions and providing resources that support district priorities and goals, upholding board policies and being effective spokespersons by being knowledgeable about district programs and goals.

- **Ensuring accountability** through evaluation of the superintendent; monitoring and evaluating policies; serving as a judicial and appeals body; monitoring student achievement and program effectiveness; approving, monitoring and adjusting district budgets; and monitoring the collective bargaining process.

- **Providing community leadership and advocacy** on behalf of students, the district’s educational program, and public education in order to build support within the local school community and at the state and national levels.

## Superintendent Roles
CSBA identifies the following standards and roles for superintendents working with the Board of Education:

- Promotes the success of all students and supports the efforts of the board to focus on student learning and achievement.
- Values, advocates and supports public education and all stakeholders.
- Recognizes and respects the different perspectives and styles of board members, staff, students, parents and community, ensuring the diverse range of views inform board decisions.
- Acts with dignity, treats everyone with civility and respect, and understands the implications of demeanor and behavior.
- Serves as a model for the value of lifelong learning and supports the board’s continuous professional development.
- Works with the board as a “governance team” and assures collective responsibility for building a unity of purpose, common vision and positive organizational culture.
- Recognizes that the board/superintendent governance relationship is supported by the district’s management team.
- Understands the distinctions between board and staff roles and respects the roles of the board as the representative of the community.
- Understands that the authority rests with the board as a whole, provides guidance to the board to assist in decision making, and provides leadership based on the direction of the board as a whole.
- Communicates openly with trust and integrity, including providing all board members with equal access to information, and recognizes the importance of both responsive and anticipatory communications.
- Accepts leadership responsibility and accountability for implementing the vision, goals and policies of the district.
<!-- Page 260 -->
# Board Norms

The governance team commits to accomplishing these standards and roles through:

- Focusing on all students
- Demonstrating respect
- Creating transparency
- Communicating openly
- Listening actively
- Keeping commitments
- Being collaborative
- Taking the time needed to govern effectively
- Encouraging everyone’s ideas and points of view
- Balancing trustee area representation vs. districtwide responsibility
- Adherence to the Brown Act

## Trustee Areas and Representation

Board members are elected by the voters within their trustee area but serve the students, families and residents throughout the district’s 75 square mile area. As such, board members should consider the impacts of decisions on all constituents when deliberating and take action in the best interest of the district as a whole rather than their specific trustee area. Unless specific to the election or trustee boundary designation processes, information prepared by staff will not delineate data specifically by trustee areas.

To facilitate strong community connections, board members are encouraged to build relationships with the organizations and residents within their trustee area in the manner they deem most appropriate and effective. As a courtesy, board members engaged in district business with organizations in another trustee area are encouraged to inform the board secretary and the board member representing the area.

## Welcoming New Members

The board president meets with each newly elected member individually to provide a copy of the Governance Handbook, the schedule of meetings, the format for meetings and governance team operations.

The superintendent meets with each newly elected member to provide an overview of the district and to introduce cabinet members and other staff who will be communicating with the board.

District legal counsel will give newly elected members a copy of the Brown Act and inform them they must conform to its requirements immediately upon assuming office and/or at any time when the newly elected is acting on behalf of the district.

The governance team attends the swearing-in ceremony and reception for the newly elected members.

## Annual Organizational Meeting

The annual organizational meeting will be held within the required 15-day period commencing on the second Friday in December.

At this meeting, the board shall:
- Elect a clerk, vice president and president from its members.
- Establish the regular school board meeting dates and starting/ending times for the year.
- Appoint representatives to specific organizations and committees and
- Determine locations of board meetings (Board Bylaws 9320, 9140).

# Speaking with a common voice
All public statements in the name of the board are made by the board president or, if appropriate, by the superintendent or superintendent’s designee.

When speaking to community groups, the media or to the public, individual board members have a responsibility to identify personal viewpoints as such and not as the viewpoint of the board.

When a board decision is reached, all board members shall support that decision until it is amended or rescinded by board action. Any board member who may wish to criticize or oppose any specific board action should do so in an open board meeting.

## Assigning work to staff
No individual member of the board, by virtue of holding office, shall exercise any administrative responsibility with respect to the schools; nor as an individual, command the services of any employee. Board members are to channel their requests and/or concerns directly to the superintendent.

## Addressing conflict among board members
The governance team norms are designed to create an open, respectful, collaborative culture. Members will engage in dialogue while welcoming an open discussion with different points of view. Members will demonstrate an ability to disagree on issues without taking the disagreements personally, nor using social media or public platforms to showcase disagreements. Members will endeavor to maintain neutral body language and tone during deliberations.

## School visitations/Extracurricular events
School visitations are encouraged to build understanding of the district’s instructional programs, curriculum and communities. Board members should make appointments with the school principal prior to visiting a campus. The board member should also email the board administrative assistant, so the visit can be placed on the board calendar alerting other members to the visit as well as the superintendent. This may prevent one school from having numerous visits from different board members during a short period of time. During visits, members should be cautious of interrupting the learning environment.

## Graduations
Graduation ceremonies honor the accomplishments of students and the contributions of their families, teachers and staff and other supporters. Each board member participates in the ceremony of the comprehensive high school(s) within their trustee area by certifying the class. Board members participate in the ceremonies of non-comprehensive high schools on a rotating basis.

# Board Meetings

## Board meeting materials
Board members will be provided with agendas and copies of all related backup materials for regular meetings at least 72 hours in advance and for special meetings at least 24 hours in advance. Members are responsible for reviewing all materials prior to the meeting to assist with an efficient and effective deliberative process.

To provide greater access and transparency to materials, the district is adopting a digital materials management platform. Upon request to the board assistant, members will be provided with devices, training, and/or assistance to access materials.

## Placing items on board agendas
Board members may request that matters be added to meeting agendas during the future agenda discussion, occurring during each regularly scheduled meeting. If a majority of board members share an interest in the matter, the board president and superintendent shall determine if the topic is within jurisdiction of the board and schedule the item. Items that are not within the jurisdiction of the board cannot be agendized. The board president and superintendent may determine if a request is primarily for informational purposes and may fulfill such a request by providing the desired information as appropriate.

## The role of board members during board meetings
The authority to direct action rests solely with the full board during public board meetings. A majority vote provides direction to the superintendent. By carefully reviewing the board packet prior to the board meeting, board members can contact the superintendent for questions about an item. All members share a common responsibility to ensure the Brown Act is followed.

## Individual board member’s request for information, materials or action
It is important for trustees to be well informed, as oversight of the district is one of the main functions of the board. Trustees recognize that they have no power as individuals to direct staff actions, and that compiling information in response to trustee requests can take staff away from their day-to-day operations of schools and the district. An individual board member will – insofar as possible – let the superintendent and staff know ahead of time when a request for information will be made in a public meeting, so the staff can be prepared to provide a thorough response. Staff will make every effort to ensure that board agenda items include thorough background and information. Requests for information not on the board agenda should be made to the superintendent who will ensure the appropriate staff person responds. All information provided by the administration in response to a request by a trustee shall be provided to all other trustees at the same time. Trustees should self-regulate the number of requests for information regarding issues not on the board agenda.

## Board meeting guidelines
It is important to recognize that a board meeting is the time for the board to do their work in public view. We agree to keep our focus on the best interest of our students at all times. After staff input and public comment, board members are encouraged to ask questions and explain their thinking related to the topic at hand. The board president recognizes members who desire to speak, alternating, so that all members have the opportunity to speak. There is not a time limit or limit to the number of questions or comments that a board member may make, but each board member should be respectful of giving other members the opportunity to speak. Nothing in this section will preclude members from speaking multiple times until all discussion is concluded.

Unless a point is important to further understanding of the immediate discussion, the board president will allow all other members to speak first and then add their comments or questions.

# Additional Board Information

## Board-appointed/board-approved committees

Board members appoint community members to committees as determined in committee bylaws. Newly elected board members will be given the option to appoint their own committee members or continue with the current appointments.

Board members serve as the conduit between a board-appointed/board-approved committee and the board as a whole. Board members are not voting members of board-appointed/board-approved committees.

If a board member wants to attend a board-appointed/board-approved committee meeting of which they are not the board liaison, the board member should contact the board administrative assistant. This will eliminate the possibility of four or more board members being in attendance at the meeting.

## Electronic media

The Board of Trustees will use electronic media (e.g., email and texting) carefully to ensure that there is no violation of the Brown Act (Government Code sections 54950-54962). The Brown Act prohibits a majority of board members from exchanging information outside of a board meeting, or using a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to:
- discuss, deliberate, or take action on an item of business within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board,
- advance or clarify an issue,
- facilitate agreement or compromise or
- advance an ultimate resolution.

The board recognizes that by using “Reply All” in email responses, the email:
- becomes part of the deliberative process,
- creates a public record and
- inhibits opportunity for any other board members to have a conversation on a topic.

Board members will be aware of, and follow, district policy as it pertains to electronic communication. The district is subject to requests for public documents as provided by the California Public Records Act (Government Code section 6250 et seq.). Public documents include emails, text messages and other correspondence from, and between, board members as well as from, and between, employees and board members, regardless of whether sent or received on district provided or personal devices or accounts.

Board members who engage constituents via social media are responsible for ensuring that opinions expressed are presented as their own and not those of the board and for following all applicable board policies and state and federal laws.

## Complaints from community/staff

When an issue is brought to a board member, the board member will use active listening to hear what the complaint or issue is. Board members need to remain cognizant of their responsibility for judicial review, staff and student confidentiality and due process when talking with the complainant.

Restate what the complainant has said to ensure that you have heard the information correctly. Ask the person what they would like the board member to do with the information and what the individual would like to see as a possible solution. Explain that you will be sharing the information with the superintendent.

Redirect the complainant to communicate with appropriate personnel and utilize the appropriate complaint procedure. Ask the individual to follow up if the problem isn’t resolved. Notify the superintendent as soon as possible with details of the complaint.

In order to support a positive working relationship among the San Juan Unified School District Board of Education, the staff, students and the community, we have reviewed and agreed to the norms and protocols outlined in the 2024 Governance Handbook. We shall renew these agreements annually.

# San Juan Unified Rules of Order

San Juan Unified's Board of Education and committees that operate under the Brown Act or Greene Acts utilize the following rules to govern operations during meetings of their bodies. District policy including administrative regulations and board policy as well as state and federal laws shall take precedence if in conflict with these rules.

## Amendments and Updates
These rules are based on Rosenberg’s Rules of Order (as published by the League of California Cities) designed for municipalities and civic organizations with modifications to meet the specific needs, practices and interests of the district. In connection with updates to the district’s Board Governance Handbook, district staff shall review any updates to Rosenberg’s Rules of Order to consider for adoption. The Board of Education shall approve all proposed changes to these rules before they become effective.

## The Role of the Chair
It is the responsibility of all members to understand the rules of parliamentary procedure, but it is the role of the chair to apply the rules to the operations of the meeting. The chair is supported in this function by staff as appropriate for the meeting body. As the chair has a larger role in the operation of the meeting, it is a courtesy that they offer comment on a matter before the body after other members and should refrain from making or seconding a motion unless convinced other members will not do so at that point in time.

## The Basic Format for an Agenda Item Discussion
A meeting is governed by the agenda and the agenda constitutes the body's agreed-upon roadmap for the meeting. Each agenda item can be handled by the chair in the following basic format:
1. The chair should announce the agenda item number and subject and then invite the appropriate person(s) to report on the item, including any recommendations they may have.
2. Following the presentation, the chair should open public comment following the body’s public comment procedure. Speaking times for public comment are limited to 2 minutes per speaker. Total time for public speaking on a public item is determined by each body’s bylaws. If the item is a public hearing, the chair must open the public hearing before beginning public comment and close the hearing upon conclusion of speakers.
3. The chair should ask members of the body if they have questions or comments regarding the item. Members may ask questions of the presenters and other members or offer comments for consideration. The chair should offer questions or comments after other members have had an opportunity. At the discretion of the chair, members may have additional opportunities to offer questions or comments.
4. Upon conclusion of discussion and questions by members, or as appropriate, the chair should invite a motion. The chair should announce the name of the member who makes the motion.
5. The chair should ask for a second to the motion. The chair should announce the name of the member who seconds a motion. All motions require a second.
6. The chair should check to make sure everyone understands the motion. This can be done by:
   a. The chair asking the maker of the motion to repeat it;
   b. The chair can repeat the motion; or
   c. The chair can ask the individual taking minutes to repeat the motion.
7. The chair should then invite discussion on the motion before the body. If no discussion is offered, or after discussion has ended, the chair should announce the body will vote on the motion.
8. The chair takes a vote by asking for the “ayes” and then asking for the “nays.” If members have not yet voted, then the chair should ask for “abstentions.”
9. The chair should announce the result of the vote and the action the body has taken.

## Motions
Motions are the vehicles for decision-making by a body. A member makes a motion by preceding the member’s desired approach with the words, “I move…” The chair usually calls for a motion by inviting members of the body to make a motion, by suggesting a motion that another member then moves or by
<!-- Page 267 -->
# APPENDIX A – RULES OF ORDER

## Types of Motions

**Basic Motion** – The basic motion is one that puts forward a decision for the body’s consideration. A basic motion might be: “I move that we create a five-member committee to plan our event.” A motion must have a second to be considered by the body.

**Motion to Amend** – If a member wants to change a basic motion that is before the body, they would move to amend it. A motion to amend might be: “I move that we amend the motion to have a 10-member committee.”

**Substitute Motion** – If a member wants to completely do away with the basic motion that is before the body, and put a new motion before the body, they would move a substitute motion. A substitute motion might be: “I move a substitute motion that we cancel the event this year.” 

“Motions to amend” and “substitute motions” are often confused, but they are quite different, and their effect (if passed) is quite different. A motion to amend seeks to retain the basic motion on the floor but modify it in some way. A substitute motion seeks to throw out the basic motion on the floor and substitute a new and different motion for it. The decision as to whether a motion is really a “motion to amend” or a “substitute motion” is left to the chair. So if a member calls what that member calls a “motion to amend,” but the chair determines that it is really a “substitute motion,” then the chair’s designation governs.

A “friendly amendment” is a practical parliamentary tool that is simple, informal, saves time and avoids bogging a meeting down with numerous formal motions. It works in the following way: In the discussion on a pending motion, it may appear that a change to the motion is desirable or may win support for the motion from some members. When that happens, a member who has the floor may simply say, “I want to suggest a friendly amendment to the motion.” The member then suggests the friendly amendment, and if the maker and the person who seconded the motion pending on the floor accept the friendly amendment, that now becomes the pending motion on the floor. If either the maker or the person who seconded rejects the proposed friendly amendment, then the proposer can formally move to amend.

A “motion to reconsider” is a special and unique motion. It can only be made by a body it is considered final and can only be reopened if a motion to reconsider is made and passed. A motion to reconsider requires a majority vote to pass like other basic motions, but there are two special rules that apply only to motions to reconsider. First, the motion to reconsider must be made at the meeting where the item was first voted upon. (This requirement can be suspended if motioned to do so and approved by a two-thirds majority.) Second, the motion to reconsider may only be made by certain members of the body. Accordingly, a motion to reconsider may only be made by a member who voted in the majority on the original motion. Any member may second the motion including those who voted in the minority. If the motion to reconsider passes, the original matter is back before the body and the new original motion is in order. The matter may be discussed and debated as if it were on the floor for the first time.

## Multiple Motions Before the Body

There can be up to three motions on the floor at the same time. The chair can reject a fourth motion until the chair has dealt with the three that are on the floor and has resolved them to avoid confusion. All motions must have been moved and seconded to be valid for consideration by the body, this includes basic motions, motions to amend and substitute motions. 

When there are two or more motions on the floor (which have all been moved and seconded) the vote should proceed **first** on the last motion that is made. For example, consider that 1) a basic motion is made followed by 2) a motion to amend and then 3) a substitute motion. The chair would first call for discussion and vote on the third motion, the substitute motion. If the substitute motion is approved, it replaces the basic motion and renders the motion to amend invalid and voting is over. If the substitute motion fails, the chair would then call for discussion and vote on the motion to amend. If approved, the amended motion would be considered for vote. If the amendment fails the original motion is then considered.

## Debate on Motions

Most motions are subject to discussion and debate by the body as long as members wish to discuss the item. Discussion remains open until such time that the chair determines it is time to move on and take action. There are exceptions when a motion is **not debatable**, and a chair must take an immediate vote if the motion is made and receives a second:

**Motion to adjourn** – This motion, if passed, requires the body to immediately adjourn to its next regularly scheduled meeting. It requires a simple majority vote.

# APPENDIX A – RULES OF ORDER

## Motion to recess
- This motion, if passed, requires the body to immediately take a recess. Normally, the chair determines the length of the recess which may be a few minutes or several hours. It requires a simple majority vote.

## Motion to fix the time to adjourn
- This motion, if passed, requires the body to adjourn the meeting at the specific time set in the motion. It requires a simple majority vote.

## Motion to table
- This motion, if passed, requires discussion of the agenda item to be halted and the agenda item to be placed on “hold.” The motion can contain a specific time in which the item can come back to the body, or the motion can contain no specific time for the return of the item. If no specific time is included in the motion, those individuals responsible for setting the body’s agenda shall identify when the item returns for consideration by the body. Motions to table require a simple majority vote.

## Motion to limit debate
- The most common form of this motion is to say, “I move the question” or “I call the question.” As a practical matter, when a member uses one of these phrases, the chair can expedite matters by treating it as a request rather than as a formal motion. The chair can simply inquire of the body “any further discussion?” If no one wishes to have further discussion, the chair can go right to the pending motion that is on the floor. However, if even one person wishes to discuss the pending motion further, then at that point, the chair should treat the call for the “question” as a formal motion and proceed to it. Motions to limit debate require a two-thirds vote.

## Majority and Super Majority Votes
- All motions require at least a simple majority vote. A tie vote means the motion fails. For example, in a seven-member body, a vote of 4-3 passes the motion. A vote of 3-3 with one abstention means the motion fails. If one member is absent and the vote is 3-3 the motion still fails. There are exceptions when a motion requires a super majority vote:

### Motion to close nominations
- A motion to close nominations for officers (such as the chair) effectively cuts off the right of the minority to nominate officers and it requires a two-thirds vote to be adopted.

### Motion to object to the consideration of a question
- Normally, such a motion is unnecessary since the objectionable item can be tabled or debated. However, when members of a body do not want an item on the agenda to be considered, then such a motion is in order. It is not debatable, and it requires a two-thirds vote to be passed.

## Counting Votes
- Quorum is determined by the body’s bylaws or other governance documents. All motions must receive a second and an “aye” vote by a majority of the body to be adopted. Abstentions votes can be used to meet quorum requirements but are not calculated in determining the outcome of the vote.

## Courtesy and Decorum
- Debate and discussion should be focused, brief and open. In the interest of time, the chair may, however, limit the time allotted to speakers, including members of the body. A member cannot generally interrupt a speaker however there are a few exceptions:

### Privilege
- A member can call for a “point of privilege.” The chair should then interrupt to ask the interrupter to state their point. Appropriate points of privilege relate to anything that would interfere with the normal comfort of the meeting. For example, the room may be too hot or too cold, or a blowing fan might interfere with a person’s ability to hear.

### Order
- A member can call for a “point of order.” Again, the chair would ask the interrupter to “state your point.” Appropriate points of order relate to anything that would not be considered appropriate conduct of the meeting. For example, if the chair moved on to a vote on a motion that permits debate without allowing that discussion or debate.

### Appeal
- If the chair makes a ruling that a member of the body disagrees with, the member may appeal the ruling of the chair. If the motion is seconded, and after debate, if it passes by a simple majority vote, then the ruling of the chair is deemed reversed.

### Call for orders of the day
- This is simply another way of saying “return to the agenda.” If a member believes that the body has drifted from the agreed-upon agenda, such a call may be made. It does not require a vote, and when the chair discovers that the agenda has not been followed, the chair simply reminds the body to return to the agenda item properly before them. If the chair fails to do so, the chair’s determination may be appealed.

### Withdraw a motion
- During debate and discussion of a motion, the maker of the motion on the floor, at any time, may interrupt a speaker to withdraw his or her motion from the floor. The motion is immediately deemed withdrawn, although the chair may ask the person who seconded the motion if

he or she wishes to make the motion and any other member may make the motion if properly recognized.

San Juan Unified School District  

## Bylaw 9270: Conflict Of Interest  
**Status:** ADOPTED  
**Original Adopted Date:** 06/09/1992 | **Last Revised Date:** 09/13/2022 | **Last Reviewed Date:** 09/13/2022  

The Governing Board desires to maintain the highest ethical standards and help ensure that decisions are made in the best interest of the district and the public. No board member, district employee, or other person in a designated position shall participate in the making of any decision for the district when the decision will or may be affected by their financial, family, or other personal interest or consideration.

In accordance with law, board members shall disclose any conflict of interest and, as necessary, shall abstain from participating in the decision.

Even if a prohibited conflict of interest does not exist, a board member shall abstain from voting on personnel matters that uniquely affect their relatives. However, a board member may vote on collective bargaining agreements and personnel matters that affect a class of employees to which their relative belongs. Relative means an adult who is related to the board member by blood or affinity within the third degree, as determined by the common law, or an individual in an adoptive relationship within the third degree. (Education Code section 35107(e)) A relationship within the third degree includes an individual's parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, children, grandchildren, great- grandchildren, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and the similar family of the individual's spouse/registered domestic partner unless the individual is widowed or divorced.

The board shall adopt a conflict of interest code that incorporates the provisions of 2 CCR 18730 by reference, specifies the district’s designated positions, and provides the disclosure categories required for each position. The conflict of interest code shall be submitted to the district’s code reviewing body for approval, in accordance with Government Code section 87303 and within the deadline for submission established by the code reviewing body. (Government Code section 87303)

Upon direction by the code reviewing body, the board shall review the district's conflict of interest code and submit any changes to the code reviewing body, or if no change is required, the board shall submit a written statement to that effect. (Government Code section 87306.5)

When a change in the district's conflict of interest code is necessitated due to changed circumstances, such as the creation of new designated positions, changes to the duties assigned to existing positions, amendments, or revisions, the amended code shall be submitted to the code reviewing body within 90 days after the changed circumstances necessitating the amendments.

have become apparent. (Government Code section 87306)

When reviewing and preparing the district's conflict of interest code, the superintendent or designee shall provide officers, employees, consultants, and members of the community adequate notice and a fair opportunity to present their views. (Government Code section 87311)

Board members and designated employees shall annually file a Statement of Economic Interest/Form 700 in accordance with the disclosure categories specified in the district's conflict of interest code. A board member who leaves office or a designated employee who leaves district employment shall, within 30 days, file a revised statement covering the period of time between the closing date of the last statement and the date of leaving office or district employment. (Government Code sections 87302, 87302.6)

**Conflict of Interest under the Political Reform Act**  
A district official, including a board member, designated employee, or other person in a designated position shall not make, participate in making, or in any way use or attempt to use their official position to influence a governmental decision in which they know or have reason to know that they have a disqualifying conflict of interest. A disqualifying conflict of interest exists if the decision will have a "reasonably foreseeable material financial effect," which is distinguishable from the effect on the public generally, on the board member, designated employee, or other person in a designated position, their immediate family, or any financial interest described in 2 CCR 18700. (Government Code sections 87100, 87101, 87103; 2 CCR 18700-18707)

A board member, designated employee, or other person in a designated position makes a governmental decision when, acting within the authority of their office or position, they authorize or direct any action on a matter, vote, or provide information or opinion on it, contact, or appear before a district official for the purpose of affecting the decision, or takes any other action specified in 2 CCR 18704.

However, a board member shall participate in the making of a contract in which they have a financial interest if their participation is required by the rule of necessity or legally required participation pursuant to Government Code section 87101 and 2 CCR 18705. A district official makes a governmental decision when, within the authority of the office or position, the district official authorizes or directs any action on a matter, votes or provides information or opinion on it, contacts or appears before another district official for the purpose of affecting the decision, or takes any other action specified in 2 CCR 18704.

However, a district official shall participate in the making of a contract in which the district official has a financial interest if such participation is required by the rule of necessity or legally required participation pursuant to Government Code 87101 and 2 CCR 18705.

A board member who has a disqualifying conflict of interest on an agenda item that will be heard in an open meeting of the board shall abstain from voting on the matter. They may remain on the board.

Conflict of Interest from Campaign Contributions  
To avoid improper influence over the board's decision-making involving the issuance of a license, permit, or other entitlements for use, including a contract, district officers, which includes board members or agency heads, shall comply with Government Code section 84308, including the following: (Government Code section 84308)

1. A district officer is prohibited from accepting, soliciting, or directing a contribution of more than $250 from any party or participant to a proceeding involving a license, permit, or other entitlement for use, including a contract, or from that person’s agent, while the proceeding is pending before the board and for 12 months following the date a final decision is rendered in the proceeding, if the board member knows or has reason to know that the party or participant has a financial interest in the board's decision.

2. Any district officer who received a contribution of more than $250 from a party or participant in the preceding 12 months shall disclose that fact on the record of the proceeding prior to the board rendering a decision in the proceeding. If the district officer willfully or knowingly received the contribution and knows or has reason to know that the participant has a financial interest in the board's decision, the district officer shall not make, participate in making, or in any way attempt to use the official position to influence the board's decision.

3. A district officer who receives a contribution that would otherwise require disqualification as described in Item #2 above may participate in the proceeding if the contribution is returned within 30 days from the time the district officer knows or should have known about the contribution and the proceeding.

4. A district officer who unknowingly accepts, solicits, or directs a contribution of more than $250 during the 12 months after the date of the board's final decision on the proceeding may cure the violation by returning the contribution, or the portion exceeding $250, within 14 days of accepting, soliciting, or directing the contribution, provided the district officer did not knowingly or willfully accept, solicit, or direct the prohibited contribution. The district officer shall maintain records of curing the violation.

The provisions in Government Code section 84308 as specified above do not apply to labor contracts, competitively bid contracts, and personal employment contracts. (Government Code section 84308)

Conflict of Interest under Government Code section 1090 - Financial Interest in a Contract  
Board members, employees, or district consultants shall not be financially interested in any contract made by the board on behalf of the district, including in the development, preliminary discussions, negotiations, compromises, planning, reasoning, and specifications and solicitations for bids. If a board member has such a financial interest in a contract made by the board, the contract is void. (Government Code section 1090)  

3  
274
<!-- Page 275 -->
Board members who willfully fail to disclose a remote interest in a contract may be subject to a fine or imprisonment pursuant to Government Code section 1097.

A board member shall not be considered to be financially interested in a contract in which they have only a "remote interest," as specified in Government Code section 1091, if the remote interest is disclosed during a board meeting and noted in the official board minutes. The affected board member shall not vote or debate on the matter or attempt to influence any other board member or district official to enter into the contract. (Government Code section 1091)

A board member shall not be considered to be financially interested in a contract in which their interest is a "noninterest" as defined in Government Code section 1091.5. Noninterest includes a board member's interest in being reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties, in the employment of their spouse/registered domestic partner who has been a district employee for at least one year prior to the board member's election or appointment, or in any other applicable circumstance specified in Government Code section 1091.5.

**Common Law Doctrine Against Conflict of Interest**  
A board member shall abstain from any official action in which their private or personal interest may conflict with their official duties.

**Incompatible Offices and Activities**  
Board members shall not engage in any employment or activity or hold any office which is inconsistent with, incompatible with, in conflict with, or inimical to the board member's duties as an officer of the district. (Government Code sections 1099, 1126)

**Gifts**  
Board members and designated employees may accept gifts only under the conditions and limitations specified in Government Code section 89503 and 2 CCR 18730.

The limitation on gifts does not apply to wedding gifts and gifts exchanged between individuals on birthdays, holidays, and other similar occasions, provided that the gifts exchanged are not substantially disproportionate in value. (Government Code section 89503) In addition, the limitation on gifts does not apply to informational materials such as books, reports, pamphlets, calendars, and periodicals. (Government Code section 82028)

Gifts of travel and related lodging and subsistence shall be subject to the current gift limitation except when: (Government Code section 89506)

1. The travel is in connection with a speech given by a board member or designated employee, provided the lodging and subsistence expenses are limited to the day immediately preceding, the day of, and the day immediately following the speech, and the travel is within the United States.
<!-- Page 276 -->
2. The travel is provided by a person or agency specified in Government Code section 89506, including a government, governmental agency or authority, bona fide public or private educational institution, as defined in Revenue and Taxation Code section 203, or nonprofit organization exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Gifts of travel exempted from the gift limitation, as described in items #1 and 2, above, shall nevertheless be reportable on the recipient's Statement of Economic Interest/Form 700 as required by law.

A gift of travel does not include travel provided by the district for board members and designated employees. (Government Code section 89506)

Honoraria  
Board members and designated employees shall not accept any honorarium, which is defined as any payment made in consideration for any speech given, article published, or attendance at any public or private gathering, in accordance with law. (Government Code sections 89501, 89502)  
The term honorarium does not include: (Government Code section 89501)

1. Earned income for personal services customarily provided in connection with a bona fide business, trade, or profession unless the sole or predominant activity of the business, trade, or profession is making speeches.

2. Any honorarium which is not used and, within 30 days after receipt, is either returned to the donor or delivered to the district for donation into the general fund without being claimed as a deduction from income for tax purposes.

The Board of Education recognizes that state open-meeting laws define a "meeting" as:

Provided that the majority of the members do not discuss among themselves district business of a specific nature, attendance by a majority of the Board's members at any of the following events and individual contacts or conversations between a Board member and any other person are not subject to state open-meeting laws:

1. Individual attendance of a board majority at conferences that are open to the public involving a discussion of general interest to the public or other school districts;

Meetings of the Governing Board are conducted for the purpose of accomplishing district business. In accordance with applicable open meeting laws (Brown Act), the board shall hold its meetings in public and shall conduct closed sessions during such meetings only as authorized by law. To encourage community involvement in the schools, board meetings shall provide the opportunity for members of the public to directly address the board. All meetings shall be conducted in accordance with law and the board's bylaws, policies, and administrative regulations.

A board meeting exists whenever a majority of Board members gather at the same time and location, including teleconference location as permitted by Government Code 54953, to hear, discuss, deliberate, or take action upon any item within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board. (Government Code 54952.2)

In accordance with law and as specified in Board Bylaw 9012 - Board Member Electronic Communications, a majority of the board shall not, outside of an authorized meeting, use a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, including social media and other electronic communications, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board. (Government Code 54952.2)

However, the superintendent or designee may engage in separate conversations or communications with board members in order to answer questions or provide information regarding an item within the subject matter jurisdiction of the board, as long as that employee or district official does not communicate the comments or position of any board members to other board members. (Government Code 54952.2)

In order to help ensure the participation of individuals with disabilities at board meetings, the superintendent or designee shall provide appropriate disability-related accommodations or modifications upon request in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. A member of the public requesting accommodation shall be resolved in a timely manner. Notice of the request for resolving such requests for accommodation shall be given in each instance in which notice of the time of a meeting is otherwise given or the agenda for the meeting is otherwise posted. (Government Code 54953, 54953.2, 54954.1, 54954.2)

Regular Meetings

School Board meetings shall generally be held two times a month, although the Board may choose to have more or less meetings in any given month as they deem appropriate. When necessary, the day preceding a regular scheduled meeting shall also be deemed regular meetings so that the Board may meet in closed session concerning student discipline matters.

The times and dates of school board meetings will be established by the Board at the annual organizational meeting.

Should a fire, flood, earthquake or other emergency render the regular meeting place unsafe, meetings may be temporarily held at a place designated by the president or designee, who must notify all news media requesting notice of regular and special meetings. (Education Code section 35140, Government Code section 54954)

At least 72 hours prior to a regular meeting, the agenda shall be posted at one or more locations freely accessible to members of the public. Agendas shall also be made available to all district employees and sites on the district's computer network. No action shall be taken on any item not appearing on the posted agenda, except as allowed by law. (Government Code section 54954.2)

The agenda of each regular meeting shall be mailed to any owner of property in the district who requests it. Requests must be filed with the Board and shall contain the address of the property.
