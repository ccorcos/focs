# Summary of Program Self Evaluation

## Staff and Board Member Participation

In accordance with the 5 CCR, Section 17709(b)(3) provide an assessment, in a narrative format, summarizing the Staff and Board Member participation in the PSE process:

Staff is part of the Program Self Evaluation (PSE) through a process we call triangulation. During a staff meeting, we go over the data from the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale (ECERS), parent surveys, and the fall/spring Desired Results Developmental Profile (DRDP's). After we have gone over the data, we formulate a plan of how we can provide support and meet our program goals for our families, students, and staff for the 24-25 school year. After the PSE is written, we send it to the San Juan Unified School Board for approval.

# Key Dimension I, Family Files, EED 01 - EED 06 (Part 1)

In accordance with the 5 CCR, Section 17709(b)(4) through 17709(b)(6), provide a summary, in a narrative format, of the findings for areas in Key Dimension I, Family Files EED 01-EED 06, that (1) met standards, and (2) describes the procedures for ongoing monitoring to ensure that those areas continue to meet standards.

Our Admission and Family Service Technician (AFST) enrolls our students based upon the eligibility priorities set forth by the California Education Code and California Code of Regulations, using categorical and income eligibility. The application of services is completed with all the appropriate signatures and the certification of family size is determined correctly based upon supporting documentation obtained from the enrolling family. Notice of Action’s (NOA’s) are completed and issued within the correct timelines and include written information regarding parent/caretaker’s responsibilities, compliance with program rules, and procedures for appeals. Parents/caretakers receive written policies and procedures of attendance at enrollment and during parent orientation.

We will continue to meet standards through the review of management bulletins, webinars, staff training, and the review of the family’s eligibility files three times a year.

# Key Dimension I, Family Files, EED 01 - EED 06 (Part 2)

In accordance with the 5 CCR, Section 17709(b)(4) through 17709(b)(6), provide a summary, in a narrative format, of the findings for areas in Key Dimension I, Family Files EED 01-EED 06, that (1) did not meet standards, and (2) a list of tasks needed to modify the program to address all items in need of improvement.

During file reviews, we found that some of our family data files included family documentation that was insufficient for connecting a child to enrolling parent/caretaker.

To address these findings, we will continue with file reviews and bi-monthly meetings with our AFST to go over any file related issues and review any new management bulletins that have come out from California Department of Education (CDE). In addition, we will create a management bulletin committee with our enrollment team.

We continue to monitor signing-in/out procedures through random checks of our signing-in/out platform.

# Key Dimension 2, Family Engagement and Strengthening, EED 07 - EED 08 (Part 1)

In accordance with the 5 CCR, section 17709(b)(4) though 17709(b)(6) provide a summary of the findings for areas in Key Dimension 2- Family Engagement and Strengthening (EED 07-EED 08) that (1) met standards, and (2) describes the procedures for ongoing monitoring to ensure that those areas continue to meet standards.

Parent orientations are held with each family on or before the child’s start date in the preschool program, with handouts and orientation materials updated annually or as necessary. Parent conferences are scheduled twice yearly, in the Fall and in the Spring, using a letter that offers a choice of dates and times for conferencing, and completion is documented with parent signature(s) on the child’s portfolio cover sheet and the Individual Development Plan (IDP). Home language support is accommodated as needed through a combination of program staff, translation technology, and community support. Conference completion is monitored through file checks of at least 20% of state-funded child portfolios and/or portfolio and assessment software (Learning Genie) at least once per year.

The Parent Advisory Committee Meetings (PAC) were successful. Every meeting had an agenda, sign-in sheet, and documentation of what occurred during the PAC, as well as time for parent input. The meetings occurred four times a year. The November meeting, Irina Shilovsky came from Central Enrollment to talk about TK/K enrollment. During the January meeting, Sneh Nair and Kelli Seidel presented on Nutrition/Nutrition Services/CACFP meal patterns. The March meeting, Jason Neglet talked about, Setting Limits. Lastly, May was about the upcoming changes in our programs. Parent Surveys will continue to be utilized for parental input.

For health and social services, families are offered community resources, family partnership agreements with school community workers to assess needs, mental health resources are provided, medical/dental referrals, and assistance with any follow-ups as needed. All California State Preschool Program (CSPP) classrooms have blended funding with Head Start and receive all the services that the Head Start grant mandates.

# Key Dimension 2, Family Engagement and Strengthening, EED 07 - EED 08 (Part 2)

In accordance with the 5 CCR, section 17709(b)(4) though 17709(b)(6) provide a summary of the findings for areas in Key Dimension 2- Family Engagement and Strengthening (EED 07-EED 08) that (1) did not meet standards, and (2) a list of tasks needed to modify the program to address all items in need of improvement.

Some conferences were not completed due to a variety of reasons, including scheduling conflicts or families’ attendance availability. To address this:

- Current and historical family survey data will be analyzed for information on conferencing issues.
- A survey will be created and sent to staff asking for feedback on why parents declined a conference.
- A presentation will be created for staff to emphasize the importance and benefits of parent engagement in general and more specifically the importance of conferences.
- Conference completion data will be compared from spring 2024 to fall 2024.
- As needed, additional or modified questions will be placed in the upcoming family survey to gather more information.

Although PAC meetings went well, to increase attendance of PAC meetings, we will be combining our PAC meeting with our Policy Committee Meetings (Head Start requirement) starting in the 24-25 school year.

For health and social services, families will continue to be provided support in getting immunizations and physicals in a timely manner. Families will be communicated with on a regular basis and offered assistance with the help from the school community workers, mental health therapist, health assistants, and nurses.

# Key Dimension 3, Program Quality, EED 09 - EED 16 (Part 1)

In accordance with the 5 CCR, sections, 17709(b)(4) through 17709(b)(6) provide a summary of the findings for areas in Key Dimension 3-Program Quality (EED 09-EED 16) that (1) met standards, and (2) describes the procedures for ongoing monitoring to ensure that those areas continue to meet standards.

Classrooms are licensed, and licenses are maintained by meeting the established guidelines by community care licensing. The staff-child ratios for preschool age children follow all licensing requirements. Standards continue to be met through hiring qualified staff.

To meet the nutritional needs of students, the nutrition standards set forth in the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) through the State of California and the Federal Government are followed. All meals served follow the CACFP Meal Patterns.

ECERS were completed in all classrooms and a rating of at least a 5.0 on the subscale for furniture for routine care, play and learning and positive peer interactions occurred. To maintain these standards, materials will be ordered as needed for student use. To maintain positive peer interactions, professional development training, continued support, and up to date strategies for modeling and teaching language skills will be provided to staff.

DRDP assessments are completed for children in the program during their first 60 days after enrollment and with required timelines thereafter, either once or twice more, depending on enrollment date. By the end of the Winter 2023 assessment period, the data showed that over half of all preschool children scored in the top 3 levels for the highest measure in each domain assessed. The breakdown is as follows: Shared Use of Space and Material was 67% of all children; Symbolic and Sociodramatic Play was 62%; Communication and Use of Language-Expressive was 62%; Number Sense of Quantity was 58%; and Gross Locomotor Movement Skills was 80% and was also the highest scoring measure in the highest scoring domain of the assessment period. In addition, the percentage of children at the top 3 levels increased between Fall and Winter 2023, ranging from 14% to 24% more, depending on the domain. Based on DRDP results, teachers use curriculum-associated lesson plans and individualization tracking sheets to plan and conduct appropriate activities for children’s learning. After each cycle of assessment, teachers create and/or adjust Individual Development Plans (IDPs—activity plans) with family input to individualize learning goals for each child.

Developmental profile data use will be monitored through lesson plans and individualization tracking sheets collected from each teacher at least twice yearly. Completed DRDPs and activity plans will be monitored through file checks of at least 20% of state-funded child portfolios and/or portfolio and assessment software (Learning Genie) at least once per year. DRDP assessment data will be aggregated and analyzed as part of ongoing program self-assessment and grant-funded work, at least once yearly.

Staff are surveyed annually and more often by our Leadership team, if needed, to identify any developmental topics, workshops, and/or training they feel would benefit their students and assist with their position. In addition, Leadership reviews the topics submitted by staff including but not limited to any findings from surveys, assessments, grant mandates and/or reviews for that school year to identify the training and developmental needs of the staff for the following year.

Key Dimension 3, Program Quality, EED 09 - EED 16 (Part 2)  
In accordance with the 5 CCR, sections, 17709(b)(4) though 17709(b)(6) provide a summary of the findings for areas in Key Dimension 3-Program Quality (EED 09-EED 16) that (1) did not meet standards, and (2) a list of tasks needed to modify the program to address all items in need of improvement.

Some documentation for DRDP measures did not fully match the developmental level marked. In addition, some Individual Development Plans (IDPs—the activity plans) and lesson plans did not clearly demonstrate an understanding of the connections between DRDP results and learning goals and lesson plans that support skill development. Finally, program-wide DRDP and ECERS data indicated that more social-emotional, language and literacy, and dual language learner support is needed across classrooms.

To address these concerns over the course of two to three school years:

- Materials for both main curricula (cognitive and social-emotional learning (SEL)) will be ordered and integrated into the available materials for classroom staff, and refresher training on the curriculum materials will be offered.
- Classroom staff will be offered professional development designed to support their growth in understanding the Desired Results system, including how to create learning goals and lesson plans that support individual skill development, using existing program curricula and supplementing as necessary with additional tools.
- Best practices professional development will be provided to reinforce flexible screen usage as one tool in a variety of strategies, rather than the only available option.
- A shift away from using ECERS and toward the use of Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS 2 Edition) and CLASS Environment tools will be supported by classroom staff professional development on the CLASS and CLASS Environment tools.
- Additional online resources will be gathered and shared to support classroom staff learning and growth in the areas of social-emotional, language and literacy, and dual language learner support.
- The new Preschool/Transitional Kindergarten Learning Foundations (PTKLF) will be shared with all classroom staff, and professional development will be provided that focuses on each domain in turn, using the lens of creating learning goals and lesson plans that support individual skill development.

Classroom teachers need more support from classroom and program support staff to gather data and implement lesson plans, but there has not been a pathway to offer more training and professional development to all staff. To address this:

- A professional development plan will be created to support the growth and skills of all classroom support staff, including classroom assistants and bilingual support staff, with an initial focus on social-emotional skill development and supporting dual language learners.
- Classroom support staff will be offered professional development designed to support their growth in understanding the connection between learning goals and assessment.
- A new Classified Staff Supervisor position has been created and hired to manage classified training processes.

Through staff surveys, observations, and reviewing assessments the following goals have been identified: staff recruitment/retention and staff wellness. Staff recruitment and staff retention have been extremely difficult. Stronger partnerships and communication with the Human Resources Department will continue to build more efficient procedures.

# Key Dimension 4, Administrative, EED 17 - EED 18 (Part 1)

In accordance with the 5 CCR, sections, 17709(b)(4) though 17709(b)(6) provide a summary of the findings for areas in Key Dimension 4-Administrative (EED 17-EED 18) that (1) met standards, and (2) describes the procedures for ongoing monitoring to ensure that those areas continue to meet standards.

Staff will be trained on the procedures needed to inventory equipment in their classroom that has been bought with State Funds. A physical inventory of the property will be taken, and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years.

The data from DRDP’s, ECERS, and parent surveys are reviewed with staff, support staff, and administration to address areas that met standards. Data from the parent surveys showed that parents felt their children were safe and happy. To maintain this standard, open communication and inclusion with all children will continue. Communication and use of language-expressive and gross locomotor skills were high. To continue this trend, curriculum associated with lesson planning and individuation to conduct appropriate activities will be utilized. To ensure peer interactions stay positive, resources will be provided at PD training supporting staff’s wellbeing as well as up to date strategies that develop modeling and language skills. During the school year, feedback from teachers will be collected to see what is working and what is not. The Leadership Team will survey our staff to gather this information.

# Key Dimension 4, Administrative, EED 17 - EED 18 (Part 2)

In accordance with the 5 CCR, sections, 17709(b)(4) though 17709(b)(6) provide a summary of the findings for areas in Key Dimension 4-Administrative (EED 17-EED 18) that (1) did not meet standards, and (2) a list of tasks needed to modify the program to address all items in need of improvement.

Parents’ surveys showed that a majority of our parents were very satisfied with cultural activities. However, to make sure all parents are satisfied, our bilingual assistants will be utilized for support when translation is needed, and school community workers will help bridge the gap between home and school. Additionally, teachers will incorporate cultural music, books, and share days in the classroom.

To increase and continue to build a strong workforce, regularly scheduled communication will take place with Human Resources. School community workers will continue to network and build strong relationships with outside community organizations to recruit staff to the program. Staff wellness is another important goal for creating a cohesive and effective work environment that improves the quality of our program. Self-care trainings for staff, trauma informed care, and training to educate on how to alleviate compassion fatigue to avoid burnout will all be provided in trainings.

In accordance with the 5 CCR, sections 17709(b)(4) though 17709(b)(6) provide a summary of the findings for areas in Key Dimension 5-Fiscal/ Audit (EED 19-EED 20) that (1) met standards, and (2) describes the procedures for ongoing monitoring to ensure that those areas continue to meet standards.

A quarterly enrollment/attendance/expense report is submitted via California Preschool Accounting Reporting Information System (CPARIS). Quarterly financial reports are pulled from the district financial system, Escape. The Fiscal staff uses the quarterly financial reports to obtain the quarterly expenditures to report for salaries, benefits, supplies, services, and indirect costs. Fiscal saves a backup of the supporting documentation used for reporting (both fiscal and enrollment/attendance). Parents are given the Family Language Instrument at time of enrollment to determine dual language learner status. Dual language learner status is only designated when the requirements of MB 23-03 are determined. Children with disabilities (exceptional needs) are included in the reporting when the child has an IEP.

To continue to meet standards, expenditure and enrollment/attendance reports are uploaded and reviewed for accuracy and completeness before they are submitted to the state. Enrollment staff is trained on the requirements of what is considered a dual Language learner and for children with disabilities (exceptional needs).

An annual audit is done of San Juan Unified School District by external auditors, Crowe LLP.

To continue to meet standards, our Early Childhood Education Department’s fiscal division audits expenses charged to the program. Fiscal meets with administration monthly to review for accuracy.

35. Describe two goals for your program. Include in your response; the data collected to identify the goal, and the action steps to be taken to improve the practice or program requirement.

1st goal:  
DRDP's, Individualized Development Plans(IDP's), and lesson plans were collected. It was concluded that the results from the documentation and/or ratings for DRDP measures was not completed timely or fully, due to a variety of reasons, including staff shortages and workload issues. In addition, program-wide DRDP data indicated that more social-emotional, language and literacy, and dual language learner support is needed across classrooms and age levels.

To address these concerns over the course of two to three school years:  
- Additional materials for curricula (cognitive and SEL) will be ordered and integrated into the available materials for classroom staff, and refresher training on the curriculum materials will be offered.  
- Identified classroom staff will be offered specific coaching and small group professional development as needed on program expectations regarding assessments.  
- Classroom staff will be offered professional development designed to support their growth in understanding the Desired Results system, including how to create learning goals and lesson plans that support individual skill development, using existing program curricula and supplementing as necessary with additional tools.  
- Additional resources will be gathered and shared to support all classroom staff learning and growth in the areas of social-emotional, language and literacy, and dual language learner support.

2nd goal:  
During file reviews, we found that some of our family data files didn't have recertifications in a timely manner.

To address these findings, we will continue with file reviews and bi-monthly meetings with our AFST's to go over any file related issues and review any new management bulletins that have come out from CDE.

36. Parent Survey: Describe the results of the parent survey and the action plans to address the feedback received from parents.  
Parents' surveys showed that a majority of our parents were very satisfied with cultural activities. However, to make sure all parents are satisfied, our bilingual assistants will be utilized for support when translation is needed, and school community workers will help bridge the gap between home and school. Teachers will incorporate cultural music, books, and share days in the classroom.

37. Briefly describe how staff and board members were a part of the self-evaluation process.  
Staff is part of the PSE through a process we call triangulation. During a staff meeting, we go over the data from the ECERS, parent surveys, and the fall/spring DRDP's. After we have gone over the data, we formulate a plan of how we can provide support and meet our program goals for our families, students, and staff for the 24-25 school year. After the PSE is written, we send it to the School Board for approval.

18. Dimension IV. Administrative

38. Program has completed the Agency Summary of Findings.  
Has the contractor met this requirement?  
Yes
<!-- Page 45 -->
39. List key findings from the agency summary of findings and the action steps that will be taken to address the findings. If the program provides services to multiple age groups provide one key finding with action steps for each age group served.

We found that our toddler and school-age programs struggled with the same issues: DRDPs, lesson plans, and individualization. The DRDP's rating, lesson plans, and the individualization were not completed timely or fully, due to a variety of reasons, including staff shortages and workload issues. In addition, program-wide DRDP data indicated that more social-emotional, language and literacy, and dual language learner support is needed across classrooms and age levels.

To address these concerns over the course of two to three school years:

- Additional materials for curricula (cognitive and SEL) will be ordered and integrated into the available materials for classroom staff, and refresher training on the curriculum materials will be offered.

- Identified classroom staff will be offered specific coaching and small group professional development as needed on program expectations regarding assessments.

- Classroom staff will be offered professional development designed to support their growth in understanding the Desired Results system, including how to create learning goals and lesson plans that support individual skill development, using existing program curricula and supplementing as necessary with additional tools.

- Additional resources will be gathered and shared to support all classroom staff learning and growth in the areas of social-emotional, language and literacy, and dual language learner support.

In order to operate a locally-designed program option, programs must seek a waiver as described in this section and must deliver the full range of services, consistent with §1302.20(b), and demonstrate how any change to their program design is consistent with achieving program goals in subpart J of this part.

A program’s request to operate a locally-designed variation may be approved by the responsible Health and Human Services (HHS) official through the end of a program’s current grant or, if the request is submitted through a grant application for an upcoming project period, for the project period of the new award. Such approval may be revoked based on progress toward program goals as described in §1302.102 and monitoring as described in §1304.2.

(c) Waiver requirements.

(1) The responsible HHS official may waive one or more of the requirements contained in §1302.21(b), (c)(1)(i), and (c)(2)(iii) and (iv); §1302.22(a) through (c); and §1302.23(b) and (c), but may not waive ratios or group size for children under 24 months. Center-based locally-designed options must meet the minimums described in section 640(k)(1) of the Act for center-based programs.

(2) If the responsible HHS official determines a waiver of group size for center-based services would better meet the needs of children and families in a community, the group size may not exceed the limits below:

(i) A group that serves children 24 to 36 months of age must have no more than ten children; and,
<!-- Page 52 -->
(ii) A group that serves predominantly three-year-old children must have no more than twenty children; and,  
(iii) A group that serves predominantly four- and five-year-old children must have no more than twenty-four children.

## LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA

### BASE GRANT
Every student generates a base grant, which funds basic educational costs such as teacher salaries, retirement costs, instructional materials, etc.

### SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT
Every student identified as low-income, English learner, or foster youth generates an additional 20% more funding above the base grant.

These funds must be spent on increasing and improving services for these priority student groups.

### CONCENTRATION GRANT
Every student identified as low-income, English learner, or foster youth above the 55% district enrollment threshold generates additional funding based on a state funding formula.

These funds must be spent on increasing and improving services for these priority student groups.

School districts receive funding from different sources: state funds under the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), other state funds, local funds, and federal funds. LCFF funds include a base level of funding for all LEAs and extra funding - called "supplemental and concentration" grants - to LEAs based on the enrollment of high needs students (foster youth, English learners, and low-income students).

# LCFF Budget Overview for Parents

The LCFF gives school districts more flexibility in deciding how to use state funds. In exchange, school districts must work with parents, educators, students, and the community to develop a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) that shows how they will use these funds to serve students.

![Budgeted Expenditures in the LCAP](attachment://image.png)

This chart provides a quick summary of how much San Juan Unified School District plans to spend for 2024-25. It shows how much of the total is tied to planned actions and services in the LCAP.

The text description of the above chart is as follows: San Juan Unified School District plans to spend $702,199,469 for the 2024-25 school year. Of that amount, $90,382,011 is tied to actions/services in the LCAP and $611,817,458 is not included in the LCAP. The budgeted expenditures that are not included in the LCAP will be used for the following:

- District and school general operating and housekeeping expenses
- Routine repair and maintenance
- Insurance
- Transportation
- Instructional materials and resources
- Special education
- Other certificated and classified employee salaries and benefits

These expenditures, while not included in the Local Control and Accountability Plan, are integral to the district's ability to serve students and families. In 2024-25, San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD) will be deficit spending to reduce funding reserves.

**Increased or Improved Services for High Needs Students in the LCAP for the 2024-25 School Year**  
In 2024-25, San Juan Unified School District is projecting it will receive $64,604,798 based on the enrollment of foster youth, English learner, and low-income students. San Juan Unified School District must describe how it intends to increase or improve services for high needs students in the LCAP. San Juan Unified School District plans to spend $74,903,557 towards meeting this requirement, as described in the LCAP.

**LCFF Budget Overview for Parents**  
**Update on Increased or Improved Services for High Needs Students in 2023-24**  
- **Total Budget Expenditures for High Needs Students**  
  - **Budgeted:** $57,856,812  
  - **Actual Expenditures for High Needs Students in LCAP:** $49,815,331  

This chart compares what San Juan Unified School District budgeted last year in the LCAP for actions and services that contribute to increasing or improving services for high needs students with what San Juan Unified School District estimates it has spent on actions and services that contribute to increasing or improving services for high needs students in the current year.

The text description of the above chart is as follows: In 2023-24, San Juan Unified School District's LCAP budgeted $57,856,812 for planned actions to increase or improve services for high needs students. San Juan Unified School District actually spent $49,815,331.00 for actions to increase or improve services for high needs students in 2023-24.

<!-- Page 155 -->
The difference between the budgeted and actual expenditures of -$8,041,481 had the following impact on San Juan Unified School District’s ability to increase or improve services for high needs students: Actual 2023-24 expenditures are preliminary. The final numbers for the year will be available in August 2024. Looking across goals 1-5, the difference between our planned expenditures and preliminary actual expenditures was due to staffing and substitute shortages, and shifts in funding to sources outside of the LCAP. The impact of the difference in funding resulted in the inability to fully implement some actions as planned. Additionally, the impact of the difference in funding results in carryover funding for the upcoming 2024-25 school year.

**Goal Analysis**  
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year. A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.  
All actions within goal 1 were implemented as planned without substantive differences. The challenges experienced during implementation included:  

2024 LCAP Annual Update for the 2023-24 LCAP for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 12 of 281
<!-- Page 161 -->
- Staff shortage, vacancies, hiring, and resignations.
- Substitute shortage for staff to attend professional learning.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.

Material differences between budgeted and estimated actual expenditures were due to staffing and substitute shortages, vacancies, and shifting funding to sources outside of the LCAP.

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.

The actions in goal 1 contributed to the following outcomes:
- San Juan did not meet the eligibility criteria for Differentiated Assistance in chronic absenteeism for African American, English learner, foster youth, homeless youth, and students with disabilities.
- Chronic absenteeism rates reduced overall, especially for African American, English learner, Hispanic, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and students with disabilities.

Programs and services within our LCAP actions that contributed to the improvement San Juan Unified made towards achieving this goal include:
- School attendance interventions that provide wraparound supports to students and families.
- Family engagement workshops, opportunities, resources, and communication in languages other than English.
- Transportation for homeless and foster youth.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

Goal: 2024-27 LCAP goals will be revised to align with state priority areas and required LCAP metrics.

Metrics: 2024-27 LCAP metrics will include required state and local data that reflects the most recent full-year data as well as all education code required student groups in the reporting of data.

Actions: 2024-27 LCAP actions will be revised to align with new goals, required metrics, data results, input from educational partners, and will address student groups and schools with the lowest performance levels on the 2023 CA School Dashboard indicators.
- See addendum A for schools within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator.

An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.  
All actions within goal 2 were implemented as planned without substantive differences. The challenges experienced during implementation included:  
- Substitute shortage impacted staff professional development attendance.  

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services.  
Material differences between budgeted and estimated actual expenditures were due to staffing and substitute shortages, vacancies, and shifting funding to sources outside of the LCAP.  

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.  
The actions in goal 2 contributed to the following outcomes:  
- San Juan did not meet the eligibility criteria for Differentiated Assistance in suspension rates for African American, foster youth, homeless youth, and students with disabilities.  
- Suspension rates declined for African American, English learner, Filipino, foster youth, homeless, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and students with disabilities.  

Programs and services within our LCAP actions that contributed to the progress San Juan Unified made toward this goal include:  
- Counseling and mentoring to support social, emotional, and mental health.  
- Alternative practices to suspension such as Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS), Restorative Practices (RP), Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL).  
- Staff for campus supervision and relationships.  
- Staff training and professional learning.  

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.  
Goal: 2024-27 LCAP goals will be revised to align with state priority areas and required LCAP metrics.  
Metrics: 2024-27 LCAP metrics will include required state and local data that reflects the most recent full-year data as well as all education.

An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.  

All actions within goal 3 were implemented as planned without substantive differences. The challenges experienced during implementation included:  
- Staff shortage impacting ability to find highly qualified staff to fill vacancies, teach before and after school programs, and implement programs and services.  
- Substitute shortage for staff to attend professional learning.  

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.  

No substantive material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures.  

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.  

The actions in goal 3 contributed to the following outcomes:  

English Language Arts (ELA)  
- Increased ELA proficiency for American Indian/Alaskan Native, foster youth, Pacific Islander, and students with disabilities.  
- Decreased ELA proficiency for African American, Asian, and English learner.  
- Lowest performance ELA for African American, English learner, and homeless.  

Math  
- Increased math proficiency for American Indian/Alaskan Native, Filipino, foster youth, Hispanic, and students with disabilities.  
- Decreased math proficiency for Asian.  
- Lowest performance in math for African American, English learner, and homeless.  

English Learner Progress  
- Decreased English learner progress towards English language proficiency.  
- Increased English learner reclassification rate to Fluent English Proficient.  

Programs and services within our LCAP actions that contributed to the progress San Juan Unified made toward this goal include:  
- ELA: Lexia English, Aspire, Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling (LETRS), Universal Design for Learning (UDL), tutoring.  
- Math: Math Recovery, UDL, tutoring.  
<!-- Page 176 -->
- English learner Progress: EL Achieve, Guided Language Acquisition Design (GLAD), Bilingual Instructional Assistants, translators, Newcomer support.

To address the areas in need of improvement, we will use a continuous improvement process that includes:
- Building on the work we have done to maintain continuity of learning.
- Analyzing multiples sources of data that includes educational partner input, state and local data, practitioner experience, and research to identify the unique needs of our students.
- Adjusting existing and creating new actions to address the unique needs of our students.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

Goal: 2024-27 LCAP goals will be revised to align with state priority areas and required LCAP metrics.

Metrics: 2024-27 LCAP metrics will include required state and local data that reflects the most recent full-year data as well as all education code required student groups in the reporting of data.

Actions: 2024-27 LCAP actions will be revised to align with new goals, required metrics, data results, input from educational partners, and will address student groups and schools with the lowest performance levels on the 2023 CA School Dashboard indicators.
- See addendum A for schools within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator.
- See addendum B for student groups within the LEA and within each school that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator.

A report of the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for last year’s actions may be found in the Annual Update Table. A report of the Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services for last year’s actions may be found in the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table.

### Goal Analysis
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

All actions within goal 4 were implemented as planned without substantive differences. The challenges experienced during implementation included:
- Staff turnover, shortage, and vacancies.
- Grant for First-Five initiative has changed impacting program funding.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.

Material differences between budgeted and estimated actual expenditures were due to staffing shortages, vacancies, shifting funding to sources outside of the LCAP, and summer school expenditures not yet incurred.

![An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.](https://example.com/image)

The actions in goal 4 contributed to the following outcomes:

**Graduation Rate**
- Increased graduation rates for Asian, English learner, foster youth, students with disabilities, and two or more races.
- Decreased graduation rates for African American, Filipino, Hispanic, Homeless, white.

**College/Career**
- Very low status level for students with disabilities.

Programs and services within our LCAP actions that contributed to the progress San Juan Unified made toward this goal include:
- Mentoring focused on providing wraparound services.
- Counseling and support in developing 4-year graduation plans using Naviance.
- Tutoring and credit recovery options such as Apex, extended year intersession, and independent study.
- Special outreach, recruitment, and opportunities for priority student groups such as Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID).
- Inclusive practice support for general and special education teachers such as co-teaching and Universal Design for Learning.
- Revising students with disabilities student code process to increase access to general education setting.

To address the areas in need of improvement, we will use a continuous improvement process that includes:
- Building on the work we have done to maintain continuity of learning.
- Analyzing multiples sources of data that includes educational partner input, state and local data, practitioner experience, and research to identify the unique needs of our students.
- Adjusting existing and creating new actions to address the unique needs of our students.

- **Describe the overall implementation of the actions to achieve the articulated goal.** Include a discussion of relevant challenges and successes experienced with the implementation process. This must include any instance where the LEA did not implement a planned action or implemented a planned action in a manner that differs substantively from how it was described in the adopted LCAP.

- **An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.**
  - Explain material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and between the Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services, as applicable. Minor variances in expenditures or percentages do not need to be addressed, and a dollar-for-dollar accounting is not required.

- **An explanation of how effective or ineffective specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.**
  - Describe the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle. “Effectiveness” means the degree to which the actions were successful in producing the desired result and “ineffectiveness” means that the actions did not produce any significant or desired result.
    - In some cases, not all actions in a goal will be intended to improve performance on all of the metrics associated with the goal.
    - When responding to this prompt, LEAs may assess the effectiveness of a single action or group of actions within the goal in the context of performance on a single metric or group of specific metrics within the goal that are applicable to the action(s). Grouping actions with metrics will allow for more robust analysis of whether the strategy the LEA is using to impact a specified set of metrics is working and increase transparency for educational partners. LEAs are encouraged to use such an approach when goals include multiple actions and metrics that are not closely associated.
    - Beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period.

- **A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.**
  - Describe any changes made to this goal, expected outcomes, metrics, or actions to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis and analysis of the data provided in the Dashboard or other local data, as applicable.
    - As noted above, beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period. For actions that have been identified as ineffective, the LEA must identify the ineffective action and must include a description of the following:
      - The reasons for the ineffectiveness, and
      - How changes to the action will result in a new or strengthened approach.

# Comprehensive Support and Improvement

An LEA with a school or schools eligible for comprehensive support and improvement must respond to the following prompts.

## Schools Identified
A list of the schools in the LEA that are eligible for comprehensive support and improvement.

- Cottage Elementary
- Kingswood K-8
- La Entrada Continuation High
- La Vista Center
- San Juan High
- Sylvan Middle

## Support for Identified Schools
A description of how the LEA has or will support its eligible schools in developing comprehensive support and improvement plans.

San Juan Unified School District will provide schools that meet the criteria for Comprehensive Support and Improvement (CSI) the opportunity to participate in a Networked Improvement Community (NIC). The NIC is a five-part series that works through the four stages of continuous improvement which includes conducting a needs assessment and root cause analysis, defining goals and evidence-based interventions, prototyping and implementing solutions, and measuring and reporting on the impact of the improvement plans. The purpose is for each school site to make changes in practice that reflect student needs and result in improved outcomes, experiences, and opportunities for students.

Each of the five network meetings will provide school leadership teams with an opportunity to engage in the continuous improvement process to address their Problem of Practice (i.e., suspension, attendance, African American achievement, etc.), and the learning space to collaborate with partner school sites within the network to share ideas, resources, and best practices. In addition to the network meetings, a coach will be assigned to each school site to provide expert guidance and personalized support throughout the NIC process. The coach will also act as a thought partner during the network meetings to help eligible CSI schools achieve their goals, and to ensure that school leadership teams are equipped with the necessary tools and resources to drive improvement. Collectively, the NIC and coach will support the development and implementation of the School Plan for Student Achievement (SPSA) in alignment with the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP).

## Monitoring and Evaluating Effectiveness
A description of how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the plan to support student and school improvement.

The district NIC facilitator and coach will engage in the following practices to monitor and evaluate the plan to support student and school improvement: 1) provide regular check-ins with site administrators and school improvement teams to refine and modify improvement plans based on regular review of data and information; 2) review each school’s Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) plans and inquiry cycles to identify measurable and actionable goals; and 3) create and share site reports with each school to provide feedback and monitor progress of plans.

This included surveys, listening sessions, 1:1 and group conversations. Input was used to help identify the unique needs of students and develop actions that specifically address those identified needs.

On May 23, 2024, a draft plan of the LCAP was presented to the Local Control and Accountability Parent Advisory Committee (LCAP PAC) and the District English Learner Advisory Committee (DELAC) in separate meetings. Both groups reviewed the draft LCAP and provided comments to the superintendent. The superintendent’s responses were posted on the district LCAP website prior to the public hearing and were shared with the LCAP PAC and the DELAC.

The draft LCAP was posted on the district LCAP website on May 23, 2024 to allow for public review and comment prior to the public hearing on June 11, 2024. On June 25, 2024, the LCAP and district budget were adopted by the Board of Education, and the Local Indicator results were reported.

A description of how the adopted LCAP was influenced by the feedback provided by educational partners.

District focus teams and the Special Education Local Plan Area (SELPA) team reviewed and monitored 2023-24 LCAP actions, metrics, and expenditures throughout the year. Additionally, LCAP PAC perspectives and insights, educational partner key themes, and climate survey results were used to support the planning and development of the 2024-25 LCAP.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal

| Goal # | Description                                                                 | Type of Goal |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 1      | Student Achievement and Implementation of State Standards - Improve achievement and outcomes for all students as measured by performance on statewide assessments, English proficiency, and college and career preparedness. | Broad Goal    |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.

- Priority 1: Basic (Conditions of Learning)
- Priority 2: State Standards (Conditions of Learning)
- Priority 4: Pupil Achievement (Pupil Outcomes)
- Priority 8: Other Pupil Outcomes (Pupil Outcomes)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

A review of Dashboard data results showed:
- African American, English learner, and homeless student groups received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard English language arts and mathematics indicators.
- Students with Disabilities student group received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard college/career indicator.
- 29 out of 65 schools had one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator (see addendum A).
- 53 out of 65 schools had one or more student groups that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator (see addendum B).

During the 2021-24 LCAP cycle, educational partners indicated that:
- LCAP goals were too broad and difficult to measure using data.
- Including current year and previous year data in LCAP was confusing.
- Not all required student groups were reported in the LCAP.

State and local data and educational partner input revealed a need to increase:
- Alignment between goals, metrics, and actions.
- Clarity to the public and board about our goals, and how we are measuring and monitoring progress.
- Focus on English learner, low income, foster youth, and student groups with the lowest performance level on a Dashboard indicator.

As a result, the 2024-27 LCAP:
- Goals are aligned to the state priority areas and required LCAP metrics.
- Metrics include required state and local data that reflects the most recent full-year data as well as all education code required student groups in the reporting of data.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal

| Goal # | Description                                                                 | Type of Goal |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 2      | Student Engagement and Course Access - Provide students with engaging programs, course work, and opportunities that address attendance, dropout, graduation, and access to a broad course of study. | Broad Goal   |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.

- Priority 1: Basic (Conditions of Learning)
- Priority 5: Pupil Engagement (Engagement)
- Priority 7: Course Access (Conditions of Learning)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

A review of Dashboard data results showed:
- African American, English learner, and homeless student groups received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard English language arts and mathematics indicators.
- Students with Disabilities student group received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard college/career indicator.
- 29 out of 65 schools had one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator (see addendum A).
- 53 out of 65 schools had one or more student groups that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator (see addendum B).

During the 2021-24 LCAP cycle, educational partners indicated that:
- LCAP goals were too broad and difficult to measure using data.
- Including current year and previous year data in LCAP was confusing.
- Not all required student groups were reported in the LCAP.

State and local data and educational partner input revealed a need to increase:
- Alignment between goals, metrics, and actions.
- Clarity to the public and board about our goals, and how we are measuring and monitoring progress.
- Focus on English learner, low income, foster youth, and student groups with the lowest performance level on a Dashboard indicator.

As a result, the 2024-27 LCAP:
- Goals are aligned to the state priority areas and required LCAP metrics.
- Metrics include required state and local data that reflects the most recent full-year data as well as all education code required student groups in the reporting of data.

![Measuring and Reporting Results](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Measuring+and+Reporting+Results)

- Actions are grouped and aligned to goals, required metrics, data results, input from educational partners, and address student groups and schools with the lowest performance levels on the 2023 CA School Dashboard indicators.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal

| Goal # | Description                                                                 | Type of Goal |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 3      | School Conditions, Climate, and Family Engagement - Address factors both inside and outside the classroom that impact student success such as family engagement, health, safety, discipline, connectedness, facilities, materials, and staffing. | Broad Goal    |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.

- **Priority 1:** Basic (Conditions of Learning)
- **Priority 3:** Parental Involvement (Engagement)
- **Priority 6:** School Climate (Engagement)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

A review of Dashboard data results showed:
- African American, English learner, and homeless student groups received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard English language arts and mathematics indicators.
- Students with Disabilities student group received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard college/career indicator.
- 29 out of 65 schools had one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator (see addendum A).
- 53 out of 65 schools had one or more student groups that received the lowest performance level on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator (see addendum B).

During the 2021-24 LCAP cycle, educational partners indicated that:
- LCAP goals were too broad and difficult to measure using data.
- Including current year and previous year data in LCAP was confusing.
- Not all required student groups were reported in the LCAP.

State and local data and educational partner input revealed a need to increase:
- Alignment between goals, metrics, and actions.
- Clarity to the public and board about our goals, and how we are measuring and monitoring progress.
- Focus on English learner, low income, foster youth, and student groups with the lowest performance level on a Dashboard indicator.

As a result, the 2024-27 LCAP:
- Goals are aligned to the state priority areas and required LCAP metrics.
- Metrics include required state and local data that reflects the most recent full-year data as well as all education code required student groups in the reporting of data.
<!-- Page 236 -->
![Measuring and Reporting Results](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Measuring+and+Reporting+Results)

- Actions are grouped and aligned to goals, required metrics, data results, input from educational partners, and address student groups and schools with the lowest performance levels on the 2023 CA School Dashboard indicators.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal

| Goal # | Description                                                                                                                                                     | Type of Goal |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| 4      | Schools with Non-Stability Rates of +25% and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Rates of +70% (Carmichael Elementary) - Within three years, improve outcomes for student groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators, and address any underlying issues with credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators. | Focus Goal   |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.

- **Priority 1:** Basic (Conditions of Learning)
- **Priority 8:** Other Pupil Outcomes (Pupil Outcomes)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

Schools with socioeconomically disadvantaged rates of +70% and non-stability rates of +25% are eligible to receive state Equity Multiplier Funds. (Non-Stability Rate = Percent of student who do not complete 180 instructional days at one school)

The State requirements to access these funds include developing at least one focus goal that addresses:
- All pupil groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the California School Dashboard.
- Any underlying issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.

School sites receiving Equity Multiplier funds engaged their educational partners to identify the unique needs of the student groups with one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator. Based on a review and analysis of educational partner input and state/local data, Equity Multiplier schools developed LCAP actions that are principally directed to improving outcomes in the required areas.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal

| Goal # | Description | Type of Goal |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 5      | Schools with Non-Stability Rates of +25% and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Rates of +70% (Encina Preparatory High) - Within three years, improve outcomes for student groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators, and address any underlying issues with credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators. | Focus Goal |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.

- **Priority 1:** Basic (Conditions of Learning)
- **Priority 8:** Other Pupil Outcomes (Pupil Outcomes)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

Schools with socioeconomically disadvantaged rates of +70% and non-stability rates of +25% are eligible to receive state Equity Multiplier Funds. (Non-Stability Rate = Percent of student who do not complete 180 instructional days at one school)

The State requirements to access these funds include developing at least one focus goal that addresses:
- All pupil groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the California School Dashboard.
- Any underlying issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.

School sites receiving Equity Multiplier funds engaged their educational partners to identify the unique needs of the student groups with one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator. Based on a review and analysis of educational partner input and state/local data, Equity Multiplier schools developed LCAP actions that are principally directed to improving outcomes in the required areas.

| Goal # | Description | Type of Goal |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 7 | Schools with Non-Stability Rates of +25% and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Rates of +70% (Howe Avenue Elementary) - Within three years, improve outcomes for student groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators, and address any underlying issues with credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators. | Focus Goal |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.

- **Priority 1:** Basic (Conditions of Learning)
- **Priority 8:** Other Pupil Outcomes (Pupil Outcomes)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

Schools with socioeconomically disadvantaged rates of +70% and non-stability rates of +25% are eligible to receive state Equity Multiplier Funds. (Non-Stability Rate = Percent of student who do not complete 180 instructional days at one school)

The State requirements to access these funds include developing at least one focus goal that addresses:
- All pupil groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the California School Dashboard.
- Any underlying issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.

School sites receiving Equity Multiplier funds engaged their educational partners to identify the unique needs of the student groups with one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator. Based on a review and analysis of educational partner input and state/local data, Equity Multiplier schools developed LCAP actions that are principally directed to improving outcomes in the required areas.

# Goals and Actions

## Goal
| Goal # | Description | Type of Goal |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| 13     | Schools with Non-Stability Rates of +25% and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Rates of +70% (Starr King K-8) - Within three years, improve outcomes for student groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators, and address any underlying issues with credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators. | Focus Goal |

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.
- **Priority 1:** Basic (Conditions of Learning)
- **Priority 8:** Other Pupil Outcomes (Pupil Outcomes)

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
Schools with socioeconomically disadvantaged rates of +70% and non-stability rates of +25% are eligible to receive state Equity Multiplier Funds. (Non-Stability Rate = Percent of student who do not complete 180 instructional days at one school)

The State requirements to access these funds include developing at least one focus goal that addresses:
- All pupil groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the California School Dashboard.
- Any underlying issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.

School sites receiving Equity Multiplier funds engaged their educational partners to identify the unique needs of the student groups with one or more lowest performance levels on a 2023 Dashboard state indicator. Based on a review and analysis of educational partner input and state/local data, Equity Multiplier schools developed LCAP actions that are principally directed to improving outcomes in the required areas.

Concentration grant funds will be used to improve working conditions for staff, learning conditions for students, stabilize staffing at highest-need schools to maintain continuity of learning, and promote increased opportunities for differentiated instruction. A pilot will be implemented with six of San Juan Unified’s highest-density schools in secondary and K-8. These schools include Encina Preparatory High, San Juan High, Arcade Fundamental Middle, Katherine Johnson Middle, Starr King K-8, and Kingswood K-8.

# Local Control and Accountability Plan Instructions
## Plan Summary
## Engaging Educational Partners
## Goals and Actions
## Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students

For additional questions or technical assistance related to the completion of the Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) template, please contact the local county office of education (COE), or the California Department of Education’s (CDE’s) Local Agency Systems Support Office, by phone at 916-319-0809 or by email at LCFF@cde.ca.gov.

## Introduction and Instructions
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) requires local educational agencies (LEAs) to engage their local educational partners in an annual planning process to evaluate their progress within eight state priority areas encompassing all statutory metrics (COEs have 10 state priorities). LEAs document the results of this planning process in the LCAP using the template adopted by the State Board of Education.

The LCAP development process serves three distinct, but related functions:

- **Comprehensive Strategic Planning:** The process of developing and annually updating the LCAP supports comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the California School Dashboard (California Education Code [EC] Section 52064[e][1]). Strategic planning that is comprehensive connects budgetary decisions to teaching and learning performance data. LEAs should continually evaluate the hard choices they make about the use of limited resources to meet student and community needs to ensure opportunities and outcomes are improved for all students.

- **Meaningful Engagement of Educational Partners:** The LCAP development process should result in an LCAP that reflects decisions made through meaningful engagement (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Local educational partners possess valuable perspectives and insights about an LEA's programs and services. Effective strategic planning will incorporate these perspectives and insights in order to identify potential goals and actions to be included in the LCAP.

- **Accountability and Compliance:** The LCAP serves an important accountability function because the nature of some LCAP template sections require LEAs to show that they have complied with various requirements specified in the LCFF statutes and regulations, most notably:

  - Demonstrating that LEAs are increasing or improving services for foster youth, English learners, including long-term English learners, and low-income students in proportion to the amount of additional funding those students generate under LCFF (EC Section 52064[b][4]-[6]).

  - Establishing goals, supported by actions and related expenditures, that address the statutory priority areas and statutory metrics (EC sections 52064[b][1] and [2]).

  - **NOTE:** As specified in EC Section 62064(b)(1), the LCAP must provide a description of the annual goals, for all pupils and each subgroup of pupils identified pursuant to EC Section 52052, to be achieved for each of the state priorities. Beginning in 2023–24, EC

Section 52052 identifies long-term English learners as a separate and distinct pupil subgroup with a numerical significance at 15 students.

- Annually reviewing and updating the LCAP to reflect progress toward the goals (EC Section 52064[b][7]).
- Ensuring that all increases attributable to supplemental and concentration grant calculations, including concentration grant add-on funding and/or LCFF carryover, are reflected in the LCAP (EC sections 52064[b][6], [8], and [11]).

The LCAP template, like each LEA’s final adopted LCAP, is a document, not a process. LEAs must use the template to memorialize the outcome of their LCAP development process, which must: (a) reflect comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the California School Dashboard (Dashboard), (b) through meaningful engagement with educational partners and (c) meets legal requirements, as reflected in the final adopted LCAP. The sections included within the LCAP template do not and cannot reflect the full development process, just as the LCAP template itself is not intended as a tool for engaging educational partners.

If a county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction over a single school district, the county board of education and the governing board of the school district may adopt and file for review and approval a single LCAP consistent with the requirements in EC sections 52060, 52062, 52066, 52068, and 52070. The LCAP must clearly articulate to which entity’s budget (school district or county superintendent of schools) all budgeted and actual expenditures are aligned.

The revised LCAP template for the 2024–25, 2025–26, and 2026–27 school years reflects statutory changes made through Senate Bill 114 (Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review), Chapter 48, Statutes of 2023.

At its most basic, the adopted LCAP should attempt to distill not just what the LEA is doing for students in transitional kindergarten through grade twelve (TK–12), but also allow educational partners to understand why, and whether those strategies are leading to improved opportunities and outcomes for students. LEAs are strongly encouraged to use language and a level of detail in their adopted LCAPs intended to be meaningful and accessible for the LEA’s diverse educational partners and the broader public.

In developing and finalizing the LCAP for adoption, LEAs are encouraged to keep the following overarching frame at the forefront of the strategic planning and educational partner engagement functions:

Given present performance across the state priorities and on indicators in the Dashboard, how is the LEA using its budgetary resources to respond to TK–12 student and community needs, and address any performance gaps, including by meeting its obligation to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students?

LEAs are encouraged to focus on a set of metrics and actions which, based on research, experience, and input gathered from educational partners, the LEA believes will have the biggest impact on behalf of its TK–12 students.

These instructions address the requirements for each section of the LCAP, but may include information about effective practices when developing the LCAP and completing the LCAP document. Additionally, the beginning of each template section includes information emphasizing the purpose that section serves.

![Plan Summary](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Plan+Summary)

**Purpose**  
A well-developed Plan Summary section provides a meaningful context for the LCAP. This section provides information about an LEA’s community as well as relevant information about student needs and performance. In order to present a meaningful context for the rest of the LCAP, the content of this section should be clearly and meaningfully related to the content included throughout each subsequent section of the LCAP.

**Requirements and Instructions**  
**General Information**  
A description of the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades transitional kindergarten–12, as applicable to the LEA.  

Briefly describe the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades TK–12, as applicable to the LEA.  
- For example, information about an LEA in terms of geography, enrollment, employment, the number and size of specific schools, recent community challenges, and other such information the LEA may wish to include can enable a reader to more fully understand the LEA’s LCAP.  
- As part of this response, identify all schools within the LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funding.  

**Reflections: Annual Performance**  
A reflection on annual performance based on a review of the California School Dashboard (Dashboard) and local data.  

Reflect on the LEA’s annual performance on the Dashboard and local data. This may include both successes and challenges identified by the LEA during the development process.  

LEAs are encouraged to highlight how they are addressing the identified needs of student groups, and/or schools within the LCAP as part of this response.  

As part of this response, the LEA must identify the following, which will remain unchanged during the three-year LCAP cycle:  
- Any school within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard;  
- Any student group within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard;  
- Any student group within a school within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard.  

**Reflections: Technical Assistance**  
As applicable, a summary of the work underway as part of technical assistance.

Page 251 of 281
<!-- Page 400 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Annually identify the reason(s) the LEA is eligible for or has requested technical assistance consistent with EC sections 47607.3, 52071, 52071.5, 52072, or 52072.5, and provide a summary of the work underway as part of receiving technical assistance. The most common form of this technical assistance is frequently referred to as Differentiated Assistance, however this also includes LEAs that have requested technical assistance from their COE.

- If the LEA is not eligible for or receiving technical assistance, the LEA may respond to this prompt as “Not Applicable.”

### Comprehensive Support and Improvement
An LEA with a school or schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement (CSI) under the Every Student Succeeds Act must respond to the following prompts:

#### Schools Identified
A list of the schools in the LEA that are eligible for comprehensive support and improvement.
- Identify the schools within the LEA that have been identified for CSI.

#### Support for Identified Schools
A description of how the LEA has or will support its eligible schools in developing comprehensive support and improvement plans.
- Describe how the LEA has or will support the identified schools in developing CSI plans that included a school-level needs assessment, evidence-based interventions, and the identification of any resource inequities to be addressed through the implementation of the CSI plan.

#### Monitoring and Evaluating Effectiveness
A description of how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the plan to support student and school improvement.
- Describe how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the CSI plan to support student and school improvement.

### Engaging Educational Partners
#### Purpose
Significant and purposeful engagement of parents, students, educators, and other educational partners, including those representing the student groups identified by LCFF, is critical to the development of the LCAP and the budget process. Consistent with statute, such engagement should support comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the Dashboard, accountability, and improvement across the state priorities and locally identified priorities (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Engagement of educational partners is an ongoing, annual process.

This section is designed to reflect how the engagement of educational partners influenced the decisions reflected in the adopted LCAP. The goal is to allow educational partners that participate in the LCAP development process and the broader public to understand how the LEA engaged educational partners and the impact of that engagement. LEAs are encouraged to keep this goal in the forefront when completing this section.

Describe any goals, metrics, actions, or budgeted expenditures in the LCAP that were influenced by or developed in response to the educational partner feedback.

- A sufficient response to this prompt will provide educational partners and the public with clear, specific information about how the engagement process influenced the development of the LCAP. This may include a description of how the LEA prioritized requests of educational partners within the context of the budgetary resources available or otherwise prioritized areas of focus within the LCAP.
  
- An LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funds must include a description of how the consultation with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds influenced the development of the adopted LCAP.

- For the purposes of this prompt, this may also include, but is not necessarily limited to:
  - Inclusion of a goal or decision to pursue a Focus Goal (as described below)
  - Inclusion of metrics other than the statutorily required metrics
  - Determination of the target outcome on one or more metrics
  - Inclusion of performance by one or more student groups in the Measuring and Reporting Results subsection
  - Inclusion of action(s) or a group of actions

  - Analysis of effectiveness of the specific actions to achieve the goal
  - Analysis of material differences in expenditures
  - Analysis of changes made to a goal for the ensuing LCAP year based on the annual update process
  - Analysis of challenges or successes in the implementation of actions

Goals and Actions  
Purpose  
Well-developed goals will clearly communicate to educational partners what the LEA plans to accomplish, what the LEA plans to do in order to accomplish the goal, and how the LEA will know when it has accomplished the goal. A goal statement, associated metrics and expected outcomes, and the actions included in the goal must be in alignment. The explanation for why the LEA included a goal is an opportunity for LEAs to clearly communicate to educational partners and the public why, among the various strengths and areas for improvement highlighted by performance data and strategies and actions that could be pursued, the LEA decided to pursue this goal, and the related metrics, expected outcomes, actions, and expenditures.

A well-developed goal can be focused on the performance relative to a metric or metrics for all students, a specific student group(s), narrowing performance gaps, or implementing programs or strategies expected to impact outcomes. LEAs should assess the performance of their student groups when developing goals and the related actions to achieve such goals.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 255 of 281
<!-- Page 404 -->
# Requirements and Instructions

LEAs should prioritize the goals, specific actions, and related expenditures included within the LCAP within one or more state priorities. LEAs must consider performance on the state and local indicators, including their locally collected and reported data for the local indicators that are included in the Dashboard, in determining whether and how to prioritize its goals within the LCAP. As previously stated, strategic planning that is comprehensive connects budgetary decisions to teaching and learning performance data. LEAs should continually evaluate the hard choices they make about the use of limited resources to meet student and community needs to ensure opportunities and outcomes are improved for all students, and to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the Dashboard.

In order to support prioritization of goals, the LCAP template provides LEAs with the option of developing three different kinds of goals:

- **Focus Goal:** A Focus Goal is relatively more concentrated in scope and may focus on a fewer number of metrics to measure improvement. A Focus Goal statement will be time bound and make clear how the goal is to be measured.
  - All Equity Multiplier goals must be developed as focus goals. For additional information, see Required Focus Goal(s) for LEAs Receiving Equity Multiplier Funding below.

- **Broad Goal:** A Broad Goal is relatively less concentrated in its scope and may focus on improving performance across a wide range of metrics.

- **Maintenance of Progress Goal:** A Maintenance of Progress Goal includes actions that may be ongoing without significant changes and allows an LEA to track performance on any metrics not addressed in the other goals of the LCAP.

## Requirement to Address the LCFF State Priorities

At a minimum, the LCAP must address all LCFF priorities and associated metrics articulated in EC sections 52060(d) and 52066(d), as applicable to the LEA. The LCFF State Priorities Summary provides a summary of EC sections 52060(d) and 52066(d) to aid in the development of the LCAP.

Respond to the following prompts, as applicable:

### Focus Goal(s)
**Description**

The description provided for a Focus Goal must be specific, measurable, and time bound.

- An LEA develops a Focus Goal to address areas of need that may require or benefit from a more specific and data intensive approach.

- The Focus Goal can explicitly reference the metric(s) by which achievement of the goal will be measured and the time frame according to which the LEA expects to achieve the goal.

### Type of Goal

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 256 of 281
<!-- Page 405 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Focus Goal.

State Priorities addressed by this goal.  
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.  
Explain why the LEA has chosen to prioritize this goal.
- An explanation must be based on Dashboard data or other locally collected data.
- LEAs must describe how the LEA identified this goal for focused attention, including relevant consultation with educational partners.
- LEAs are encouraged to promote transparency and understanding around the decision to pursue a focus goal.

Required Focus Goal(s) for LEAs Receiving Equity Multiplier Funding  
Description  
LEAs receiving Equity Multiplier funding must include one or more focus goals for each school generating Equity Multiplier funding. In addition to addressing the focus goal requirements described above, LEAs must adhere to the following requirements.

Focus goals for Equity Multiplier schoolsites must address the following:
(A) All student groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the Dashboard, and  
(B) Any underlying issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators, if applicable.  
- Focus Goals for each and every Equity Multiplier schoolsite must identify specific metrics for each identified student group, as applicable.  
- An LEA may create a single goal for multiple Equity Multiplier schoolsites if those schoolsites have the same student group(s) performing at the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the Dashboard or, experience similar issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.
  - When creating a single goal for multiple Equity Multiplier schoolsites, the goal must identify the student groups and the performance levels on the Dashboard that the Focus Goal is addressing; or,  
  - The common issues the schoolsites are experiencing in credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators, if applicable.

Type of Goal

Page 257 of 281
<!-- Page 406 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Identify the type of goal being implemented as an Equity Multiplier Focus Goal.

State Priorities addressed by this goal.

Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.

Explain why the LEA has chosen to prioritize this goal.

- An explanation must be based on Dashboard data or other locally collected data.
- LEAs must describe how the LEA identified this goal for focused attention, including relevant consultation with educational partners.
- LEAs are encouraged to promote transparency and understanding around the decision to pursue a focus goal.
- In addition to this information, the LEA must also identify:
  - The school or schools to which the goal applies.

LEAs are encouraged to approach an Equity Multiplier goal from a wholistic standpoint, considering how the goal might maximize student outcomes through the use of LCFF and other funding in addition to Equity Multiplier funds.

- Equity Multiplier funds must be used to supplement, not supplant, funding provided to Equity Multiplier schoolsites for purposes of the LCFF, the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (ELO-P), the Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialists (LCRS) Grant Program, and/or the California Community Schools Partnership Program (CCSPP).
- This means that Equity Multiplier funds must not be used to replace funding that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement LEA-wide actions identified in the LCAP or that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement provisions of the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP.

Note: EC Section 42238.024(b)(1) (California Legislative Information) requires that Equity Multiplier funds be used for the provision of evidence-based services and supports for students. Evidence-based services and supports are based on objective evidence that has informed the design of the service or support and/or guides the modification of those services and supports. Evidence-based supports and strategies are most commonly based on educational research and/or metrics of LEA, school, and/or student performance.

Broad Goal Description

Describe what the LEA plans to achieve through the actions included in the goal.

- The description of a broad goal will be clearly aligned with the expected measurable outcomes included for the goal. 

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 258 of 281
<!-- Page 407 -->
- The goal description organizes the actions and expected outcomes in a cohesive and consistent manner.
- A goal description is specific enough to be measurable in either quantitative or qualitative terms. A broad goal is not as specific as a focus goal. While it is specific enough to be measurable, there are many different metrics for measuring progress toward the goal.

### Type of Goal
Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Broad Goal.

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
Explain why the LEA developed this goal and how the actions and metrics grouped together will help achieve the goal.

### Maintenance of Progress Goal
#### Description
Describe how the LEA intends to maintain the progress made in the LCFF State Priorities not addressed by the other goals in the LCAP.
- Use this type of goal to address the state priorities and applicable metrics not addressed within the other goals in the LCAP.
- The state priorities and metrics to be addressed in this section are those for which the LEA, in consultation with educational partners, has determined to maintain actions and monitor progress while focusing implementation efforts on the actions covered by other goals in the LCAP.

### Type of Goal
Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Maintenance of Progress Goal.

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
Explain how the actions will sustain the progress exemplified by the related metrics.

### Measuring and Reporting Results:
For each LCAP year, identify the metric(s) that the LEA will use to track progress toward the expected outcomes.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 259 of 281
<!-- Page 408 -->
- LEAs must identify metrics for specific student groups, as appropriate, including expected outcomes that address and reduce disparities in outcomes between student groups.

- The metrics may be quantitative or qualitative; but at minimum, an LEA’s LCAP must include goals that are measured using all of the applicable metrics for the related state priorities, in each LCAP year, as applicable to the type of LEA.

- To the extent a state priority does not specify one or more metrics (e.g., implementation of state academic content and performance standards), the LEA must identify a metric to use within the LCAP. For these state priorities, LEAs are encouraged to use metrics based on or reported through the relevant local indicator self-reflection tools within the Dashboard.

- Required metrics for LEA-wide actions: For each action identified as 1) contributing towards the requirement to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, including long-term English learners, and low-income students and 2) being provided on an LEA-wide basis, the LEA must identify one or more metrics to monitor the effectiveness of the action and its budgeted expenditures.
  - These required metrics may be identified within the action description or the first prompt in the increased or improved services section, however the description must clearly identify the metric(s) being used to monitor the effectiveness of the action and the action(s) that the metric(s) apply to.

- Required metrics for Equity Multiplier goals: For each Equity Multiplier goal, the LEA must identify:
  - The specific metrics for each identified student group at each specific schoolsite, as applicable, to measure the progress toward the goal, and/or
  - The specific metrics used to measure progress in meeting the goal related to credentialing, subject matter preparation, or educator retention at each specific schoolsite.

Complete the table as follows:

Metric #
- Enter the metric number.

Metric
- Identify the standard of measure being used to determine progress towards the goal and/or to measure the effectiveness of one or more actions associated with the goal.

Baseline
- Enter the baseline when completing the LCAP for 2024–25.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 260 of 281
<!-- Page 409 -->
- Use the most recent data associated with the metric available at the time of adoption of the LCAP for the first year of the three-year plan. LEAs may use data as reported on the 2023 Dashboard for the baseline of a metric only if that data represents the most recent available data (e.g., high school graduation rate).

- Using the most recent data available may involve reviewing data the LEA is preparing for submission to the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS) or data that the LEA has recently submitted to CALPADS.

- Indicate the school year to which the baseline data applies.

- The baseline data must remain unchanged throughout the three-year LCAP.
  - This requirement is not intended to prevent LEAs from revising the baseline data if it is necessary to do so. For example, if an LEA identifies that its data collection practices for a particular metric are leading to inaccurate data and revises its practice to obtain accurate data, it would also be appropriate for the LEA to revise the baseline data to align with the more accurate data process and report its results using the accurate data.
  - If an LEA chooses to revise its baseline data, then, at a minimum, it must clearly identify the change as part of its response to the description of changes prompt in the Goal Analysis for the goal. LEAs are also strongly encouraged to involve their educational partners in the decision of whether or not to revise a baseline and to communicate the proposed change to their educational partners.

- Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one- or two-year LCAP may identify a new baseline each year, as applicable.

### Year 1 Outcome
- When completing the LCAP for 2025–26, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies.
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one-year LCAP may provide the Year 1 Outcome when completing the LCAP for both 2025–26 and 2026–27 or may provide the Year 1 Outcome for 2025–26 and provide the Year 2 Outcome for 2026–27.

### Year 2 Outcome
- When completing the LCAP for 2026–27, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies.
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one-year LCAP may identify the Year 2 Outcome as not applicable when completing the LCAP for 2026–27 or may provide the Year 2 Outcome for 2026–27.

### Target for Year 3 Outcome
- When completing the first year of the LCAP, enter the target outcome for the relevant metric the LEA expects to achieve by the end of the three-year LCAP cycle.
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one- or two-year LCAP may identify a Target for Year 1 or Target for Year 2, as applicable.

### Goal Analysis:

Enter the LCAP Year.

Using actual annual measurable outcome data, including data from the Dashboard, analyze whether the planned actions were effective towards achieving the goal. “Effective” means the degree to which the planned actions were successful in producing the target result. Respond to the prompts as instructed.

**Note:** When completing the 2024–25 LCAP, use the 2023–24 Local Control and Accountability Plan Annual Update template to complete the Goal Analysis and identify the Goal Analysis prompts in the 2024–25 LCAP as “Not Applicable.”

A description of overall implementation, including any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions, and any relevant challenges and successes experienced with implementation.

- Describe the overall implementation of the actions to achieve the articulated goal, including relevant challenges and successes experienced with implementation.
  - Include a discussion of relevant challenges and successes experienced with the implementation process.
  - This discussion must include any instance where the LEA did not implement a planned action or implemented a planned action in a manner that differs substantively from how it was described in the adopted LCAP.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.
- Explain material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and between the Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services, as applicable. Minor variances in expenditures or percentages do not need to be addressed, and a dollar-for-dollar accounting is not required.

A description of the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions to date in making progress toward the goal.
- Describe the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions to date in making progress toward the goal. “Effectiveness” means the degree to which the actions were successful in producing the target result and “ineffectiveness” means that the actions did not produce any significant or targeted result.
  - In some cases, not all actions in a goal will be intended to improve performance on all of the metrics associated with the goal.
  - When responding to this prompt, LEAs may assess the effectiveness of a single action or group of actions within the goal in the context of performance on a single metric or group of specific metrics within the goal that are applicable to the action(s). Grouping actions with metrics will allow for more robust analysis of whether the strategy the LEA is using to impact a specified set of metrics is working and increase transparency for educational partners. LEAs are encouraged to use such an approach when goals include multiple actions and metrics that are not closely associated.
  - Beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, target outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.
- Describe any changes made to this goal, expected outcomes, metrics, or actions to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis and analysis of the data provided in the Dashboard or other local data, as applicable.
  - As noted above, beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period. For actions that have been identified as ineffective, the LEA must identify the ineffective action and must include a description of the following:
    - The reasons for the ineffectiveness, and
    - How changes to the action will result in a new or strengthened approach.

  - These required actions will be effective for the three-year LCAP cycle.

## Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students

### Purpose
A well-written Increased or Improved Services section provides educational partners with a comprehensive description, within a single dedicated section, of how an LEA plans to increase or improve services for its unduplicated students as defined in EC Section 42238.02 in grades TK–12 as compared to all students in grades TK–12, as applicable, and how LEA-wide or schoolwide actions identified for this purpose meet regulatory requirements. Descriptions provided should include sufficient detail yet be sufficiently succinct to promote a broader understanding of educational partners to facilitate their ability to provide input. An LEA’s description in this section must align with the actions included in the Goals and Actions section as contributing.

**Please Note:** For the purpose of meeting the Increased or Improved Services requirement and consistent with EC Section 42238.02, long-term English learners are included in the English learner student group.

### Statutory Requirements
An LEA is required to demonstrate in its LCAP how it is increasing or improving services for its students who are foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income, collectively referred to as unduplicated students, as compared to the services provided to all students in proportion to the increase in funding it receives based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the LEA (EC Section 42238.07[a][1], EC Section 52064[b][8][B]; 5 CCR Section 15496[a]). This proportionality percentage is also known as the “minimum proportionality percentage” or “MPP.” The manner in which an LEA demonstrates it is meeting its MPP is two-fold: (1) through the expenditure of LCFF funds or through the identification of a Planned Percentage of Improved Services as documented in the Contributing Actions Table, and (2) through the explanations provided in the Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students section.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 265 of 281
<!-- Page 414 -->
To improve services means to grow services in quality and to increase services means to grow services in quantity. Services are increased or improved by those actions in the LCAP that are identified in the Goals and Actions section as contributing to the increased or improved services requirement, whether they are provided across the entire LEA (LEA-wide action), provided to an entire school (Schoolwide action), or solely provided to one or more unduplicated student group(s) (Limited action).

Therefore, for any action contributing to meet the increased or improved services requirement, the LEA must include an explanation of:

- How the action is increasing or improving services for the unduplicated student group(s) (Identified Needs and Action Design), and
- How the action meets the LEA's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priority areas (Measurement of Effectiveness).

**LEA-wide and Schoolwide Actions**  
In addition to the above required explanations, LEAs must provide a justification for why an LEA-wide or Schoolwide action is being provided to all students and how the action is intended to improve outcomes for unduplicated student group(s) as compared to all students.

- Conclusory statements that a service will help achieve an expected outcome for the goal, without an explicit connection or further explanation as to how, are not sufficient.
- Further, simply stating that an LEA has a high enrollment percentage of a specific student group or groups does not meet the increased or improved services standard because enrolling students is not the same as serving students.

**For School Districts Only**  
Actions provided on an LEA-wide basis at school districts with an unduplicated pupil percentage of less than 55 percent must also include a description of how the actions are the most effective use of the funds to meet the district's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priority areas. The description must provide the basis for this determination, including any alternatives considered, supporting research, experience, or educational theory.

Actions provided on a Schoolwide basis for schools with less than 40 percent enrollment of unduplicated pupils must also include a description of how these actions are the most effective use of the funds to meet the district's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priority areas. The description must provide the basis for this determination, including any alternatives considered, supporting research, experience, or educational theory.

**Requirements and Instructions**  
Complete the tables as follows:

**Total Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants**

- Specify the amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grant funds the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year based on the number and concentration of foster youth, English learner, and low-income students. This amount includes the Additional 15 percent LCFF Concentration Grant.

<!-- Page 415 -->
![Projected Additional 15 percent LCFF Concentration Grant](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Projected+Additional+15+percent+LCFF+Concentration+Grant)

- Specify the amount of additional LCFF concentration grant add-on funding, as described in EC Section 42238.02, that the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year.

**Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year**
- Specify the estimated percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

**LCFF Carryover — Percentage**
- Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

**LCFF Carryover — Dollar**
- Specify the LCFF Carryover — Dollar amount identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover amount is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify an amount of zero ($0).

**Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year**
- Add the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the Proportional LCFF Required Carryover Percentage and specify the percentage. This is the LEA’s percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year, as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

**Required Descriptions:**
**LEA-wide and Schoolwide Actions**
For each action being provided to an entire LEA or school, provide an explanation of (1) the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed, (2) how the action is designed to address the identified need(s) and why it is being provided on an LEA or schoolwide basis, and (3) the metric(s) used to measure the effectiveness of the action in improving outcomes for the unduplicated student group(s).

If the LEA has provided this required description in the Action Descriptions, state as such within the table.

**Complete the table as follows:**

**Identified Need(s)**
Provide an explanation of the unique identified need(s) of the LEA’s unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed.

## How the Action(s) are Designed to Address Need(s) and Why it is Provided on an LEA-wide or Schoolwide Basis
Provide an explanation of how the action as designed will address the unique identified need(s) of the LEA’s unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed and the rationale for why the action is being provided on an LEA-wide or schoolwide basis.
- As stated above, conclusory statements that a service will help achieve an expected outcome for the goal, without an explicit connection or further explanation as to how, are not sufficient.
- Further, simply stating that an LEA has a high enrollment percentage of a specific student group or groups does not meet the increased or improved services standard because enrolling students is not the same as serving students.

## Metric(s) to Monitor Effectiveness
Identify the metric(s) being used to measure the progress and effectiveness of the action(s).

**Note for COEs and Charter Schools:** In the case of COEs and charter schools, schoolwide and LEA-wide are considered to be synonymous.

## Limited Actions
For each action being solely provided to one or more unduplicated student group(s), provide an explanation of (1) the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served, (2) how the action is designed to address the identified need(s), and (3) how the effectiveness of the action in improving outcomes for the unduplicated student group(s) will be measured.

If the LEA has provided the required descriptions in the Action Descriptions, state as such.

### Complete the table as follows:

#### Identified Need(s)
Provide an explanation of the unique need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served identified through the LEA’s needs assessment. A meaningful needs assessment includes, at a minimum, analysis of applicable student achievement data and educational partner feedback.

#### How the Action(s) are Designed to Address Need(s)
Provide an explanation of how the action is designed to address the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served.

Metric(s) to Monitor Effectiveness
Identify the metric(s) being used to measure the progress and effectiveness of the action(s).

For any limited action contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement that is associated with a Planned Percentage of Improved Services in the Contributing Summary Table rather than an expenditure of LCFF funds, describe the methodology that was used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage, as applicable.

- For each action with an identified Planned Percentage of Improved Services, identify the goal and action number and describe the methodology that was used.

- When identifying a Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA must describe the methodology that it used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. The percentage of improved services for an action corresponds to the amount of LCFF funding that the LEA estimates it would expend to implement the action if it were funded.

- For example, an LEA determines that there is a need to analyze data to ensure that instructional aides and expanded learning providers know what targeted supports to provide to students who are foster youth. The LEA could implement this action by hiring additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students, which, based on the LEA’s current pay scale, the LEA estimates would cost $165,000. Instead, the LEA chooses to utilize a portion of existing staff time to analyze data relating to students who are foster youth. This analysis will then be shared with site principals who will use the data to coordinate services provided by instructional assistants and expanded learning providers to target support to students. In this example, the LEA would divide the estimated cost of $165,000 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Total Planned Expenditures Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Planned Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

Additional Concentration Grant Funding
A description of the plan for how the additional concentration grant add-on funding identified above will be used to increase the number of staff providing direct services to students at schools that have a high concentration (above 55 percent) of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students, as applicable.

An LEA that receives the additional concentration grant add-on described in EC Section 42238.02 is required to demonstrate how it is using these funds to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is equal to or less than 55 percent. The staff who provide direct services to students must be certificated staff and/or classified staff employed by the LEA; classified staff includes custodial staff.

Provide the following descriptions, as applicable to the LEA:

- An LEA that does not receive a concentration grant or the concentration grant add-on must indicate that a response to this prompt is not applicable.

- Identify the goal and action numbers of the actions in the LCAP that the LEA is implementing to meet the requirement to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Unified School District  
Page 269 of 281
<!-- Page 418 -->
- An LEA that does not have comparison schools from which to describe how it is using the concentration grant add-on funds, such as a single-school LEA or an LEA that only has schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, must describe how it is using the funds to increase the number of credentialed staff, classified staff, or both, including custodial staff, who provide direct services to students at selected schools and the criteria used to determine which schools require additional staffing support.

- In the event that an additional concentration grant add-on is not sufficient to increase staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, the LEA must describe how it is using the funds to retain staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

Complete the table as follows:

- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA.

  - The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA.
  
  - The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.

- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA.

  - The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA.
  
  - The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of FTE staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.

Action Tables
Complete the Total Planned Expenditures Table for each action in the LCAP. The information entered into this table will automatically populate the other Action Tables. Information is only entered into the Total Planned Expenditures Table, the Annual Update Table, the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, and the LCFF Carryover Table. The word “input” has been added to column headers to aid in identifying the column(s) where information will be entered. Information is not entered on the remaining Action tables.

The following tables are required to be included as part of the LCAP adopted by the local governing board or governing body:

- Table 1: Total Planned Expenditures Table (for the coming LCAP Year)

- Table 2: Contributing Actions Table (for the coming LCAP Year)
<!-- Page 419 -->
- Table 3: Annual Update Table (for the current LCAP Year)
- Table 4: Contributing Actions Annual Update Table (for the current LCAP Year)
- Table 5: LCFF Carryover Table (for the current LCAP Year)

Note: The coming LCAP Year is the year that is being planned for, while the current LCAP year is the current year of implementation. For example, when developing the 2024–25 LCAP, 2024–25 will be the coming LCAP Year and 2023–24 will be the current LCAP Year.

## Total Planned Expenditures Table
In the Total Planned Expenditures Table, input the following information for each action in the LCAP for that applicable LCAP year:

- **LCAP Year**: Identify the applicable LCAP Year.

1. **Projected LCFF Base Grant**: Provide the total amount estimated LCFF entitlement for the coming school year, excluding the supplemental and concentration grants and the add-ons for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant program, the former Home-to-School Transportation program, and the Small School District Transportation program, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). Note that the LCFF Base Grant for purposes of the LCAP also includes the Necessary Small Schools and Economic Recovery Target allowances for school districts, and County Operations Grant for COEs.

   See EC sections 2574 (for COEs) and 42238.02 (for school districts and charter schools), as applicable, for LCFF entitlement calculations.

2. **Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants**: Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants estimated on the basis of the number and concentration of unduplicated students for the coming school year.

3. **Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year**: This percentage will not be entered; it is calculated based on the Projected LCFF Base Grant and the Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the coming LCAP year.

- **LCFF Carryover — Percentage**: Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table from the prior LCAP year. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

- **Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year**: This percentage will not be entered; it is calculated based on the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the LCFF Carryover — Percentage. 

This is the percentage by which the LEA must increase or improve services for unduplicated pupils as compared to the services provided to all students in the coming LCAP year.

- **Goal #:** Enter the LCAP Goal number for the action.
- **Action #:** Enter the action’s number as indicated in the LCAP Goal.
- **Action Title:** Provide a title of the action.
- **Student Group(s):** Indicate the student group or groups who will be the primary beneficiary of the action by entering "All," or by entering a specific student group or groups.
- **Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?:** Type “Yes” if the action is included as contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement; OR, type “No” if the action is not included as contributing to the increased or improved services requirement.
- **If “Yes” is entered into the Contributing column, then complete the following columns:**
  - **Scope:** The scope of an action may be LEA-wide (i.e., districtwide, countywide, or charterwide), schoolwide, or limited. An action that is LEA-wide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of the LEA. An action that is schoolwide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of a single school. An action that is limited in its scope is an action that serves only one or more unduplicated student groups.
  - **Unduplicated Student Group(s):** Regardless of scope, contributing actions serve one or more unduplicated student groups. Indicate one or more unduplicated student groups for whom services are being increased or improved as compared to what all students receive.
  - **Location:** Identify the location where the action will be provided. If the action is provided to all schools within the LEA, the LEA must indicate “All Schools.” If the action is provided to specific schools within the LEA or specific grade spans only, the LEA must enter “Specific Schools” or “Specific Grade Spans.” Identify the individual school or a subset of schools or grade spans (e.g., all high schools or grades transitional kindergarten through grade five), as appropriate.
- **Time Span:** Enter “ongoing” if the action will be implemented for an indeterminate period of time. Otherwise, indicate the span of time for which the action will be implemented. For example, an LEA might enter “1 Year,” or “2 Years,” or “6 Months.”
- **Total Personnel:** Enter the total amount of personnel expenditures utilized to implement this action.
- **Total Non-Personnel:** This amount will be automatically calculated based on information provided in the Total Personnel column and the Total Funds column.
- **LCFF Funds:** Enter the total amount of LCFF funds utilized to implement this action, if any. LCFF funds include all funds that make up an LEA’s total LCFF target (i.e., base grant, grade span adjustment, supplemental grant, concentration grant, Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant, and Home-To-School Transportation). 

Page 272 of 281
<!-- Page 421 -->
![Contributing Actions Table](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Contributing+Actions+Table)

- Note: For an action to contribute towards meeting the increased or improved services requirement, it must include some measure of LCFF funding. The action may also include funding from other sources; however, the extent to which an action contributes to meeting the increased or improved services requirement is based on the LCFF funding being used to implement the action.

- **Other State Funds**: Enter the total amount of Other State Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

  - Note: Equity Multiplier funds must be included in the “Other State Funds” category, not in the “LCFF Funds” category. As a reminder, Equity Multiplier funds must be used to supplement, not supplant, funding provided to Equity Multiplier schoolsites for purposes of the LCFF, the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP. This means that Equity Multiplier funds must not be used to replace funding that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement LEA-wide actions identified in the LEA’s LCAP or that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement provisions of the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP.

- **Local Funds**: Enter the total amount of Local Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

- **Federal Funds**: Enter the total amount of Federal Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.

- **Total Funds**: This amount is automatically calculated based on amounts entered in the previous four columns.

- **Planned Percentage of Improved Services**: For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the planned quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%). A limited action is an action that only serves foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income students.

  - As noted in the instructions for the Increased or Improved Services section, when identifying a Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA must describe the methodology that it used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. The percentage of improved services for an action corresponds to the amount of LCFF funding that the LEA estimates it would expend to implement the action if it were funded.

  - For example, an LEA determines that there is a need to analyze data to ensure that instructional aides and expanded learning providers know what targeted supports to provide to students who are foster youth. The LEA could implement this action by hiring additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students, which, based on the LEA’s current pay scale, the LEA estimates would cost $165,000. Instead, the LEA chooses to utilize a portion of existing staff time to analyze data relating to students who are foster youth. This analysis will then be shared with site principals who will use the data to coordinate services provided by instructional assistants and expanded learning providers to target support to students. In this example, the LEA would divide the estimated cost of $165,000 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Planned Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

As noted above, information will not be entered in the Contributing Actions Table; however, the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column will need to be checked to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses.

## Annual Update Table
In the Annual Update Table, provide the following information for each action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditures to implement this action, if any.

## Contributing Actions Annual Update Table
In the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, check the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses. Provide the following information for each contributing action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

- **6. Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants:** Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants estimated based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the current school year.

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditure of LCFF funds used to implement this action, if any.

- **Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services:** For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis only to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the total estimated actual quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%).

  - Building on the example provided above for calculating the Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA in the example implements the action. As part of the annual update process, the LEA reviews implementation and student outcome data and determines that the action was implemented with fidelity and that outcomes for foster youth students improved. The LEA reviews the original estimated cost for the action and determines that had it hired additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students that estimated actual cost would have been $169,500 due to a cost of living adjustment. The LEA would divide the estimated actual cost of $169,500 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

## LCFF Carryover Table
- **9. Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant:** Provide the total amount of estimated LCFF Target Entitlement for the current school year, excluding the supplemental and concentration grants and the add-ons for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant program, the former Home-to-School Transportation program, and the Small School District Transportation program, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). Note that the LCFF Base Grant for purposes of the LCAP also includes the Necessary Small Schools and Economic.

- **10. Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Current School Year:** This percentage will not be entered. The percentage is calculated based on the amounts of the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9) and the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants (6), pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8), plus the LCFF Carryover – Percentage from the prior year. This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the current LCAP year.

![2023-24 LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN (LCAP) EDUCATIONAL PARTNER ENGAGEMENT](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=2023-24+LOCAL+CONTROL+AND+ACCOUNTABILITY+PLAN+%28LCAP%29+EDUCATIONAL+PARTNER+ENGAGEMENT)

The Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) is a three-year plan that is revised annually that addresses the state priority areas, includes the diverse perspectives of our educational partners, and describes how services are provided to improve student performance with an emphasis on English learner, low income, and foster youth students.

State priority areas include:
- **Student Achievement and Implementation of State Standards** - Improve achievement and outcomes for all students as measured by performance on statewide assessments, English proficiency, and college and career preparedness.
- **Student Engagement and Course Access** - Provide students with engaging programs, course work, and opportunities that address attendance, dropout, graduation, and access to a broad course of study.
- **School Conditions, Climate, and Family Engagement** - Address factors both inside and outside the classroom that impact student success such as family engagement, health, safety, discipline, connectedness, facilities, materials, and staffing.

Out educational partners include students, families, staff, and community members. A total of 3,337 educational partners were engaged using various outreach and communication strategies to differentiate our approach and maximize participation especially for our priority student groups. These strategies included:
- Thought Exchanges, listening sessions, focus groups, and surveys
- Meeting with partners in 1:1, group, online, and in person settings
- Communicating with our educational partners via website, mass notification, social media, community newsletters, and targeted outreach

Educational partners were asked to consider what our schools are doing well and what our schools can do differently to improve support for students and families. Input was then reviewed within and across groups for common themes to identify both districtwide and student group specific needs.

Collectively, the eight state priority areas, LCAP metrics, and educational partner input were analyzed and used to revise existing LCAP actions, develop new actions, and allocate funds strategically to reflect the voice and needs of our entire San Juan community.

| 1  | DELAC     | It is a significant recognition to be reclassified and families appreciate this recognition. The majority of families do not know about the reclassification process.                                   | Translated letters informing parents of the reclassification process are sent annually. We will include reclassification as a topic for DELAC and encourage school sites that are not already doing so to add the reclassification process to their ELAC agendas. Additionally, we have identified that a lack of awareness and communication about the reclassification process is an area of improvement. In response to this identified need, LCAP Action 1.25 focuses on increasing the number of students, families, and staff who understand the English Language Development (ELD) process, purpose, pathways, and options.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 5 | LCAP PAC |
|   | Is there funding to support safe biking and walking to school such as crossing guards? Safety has come up in multiple meetings, including at Board of Education meetings as public comments. |

While not a requirement, sites are encouraged to post SSC calendar and minutes on their websites. Historically, School Site Council (SSC) minutes have been available upon request to accommodate translation. Inclusion of information on SSC is part of the standard website template, however specific information posted will vary by site. For example, some sites choose to share information via their school newsletter. Information about School Site Councils and SPSAs are publicly available on the district and school website.

See response #2 above.

The practitioners who are funded in LCAP such as counselors, school social workers, and mental health therapists often incorporate mindfulness in their work with students and staff. Professional learning opportunities have been made available to staff to develop an understanding of mindful practices that can be embedded in their daily practice.

The district has employed a Safe Routes to School staff member through the use of grant funds. This position has engaged in activities such as walk audits to determine best paths of travel to and from schools, bike rodeos to teach safe biking skills to students, traffic advisement to address concerns or when new modernizations projects are undertaken. The grant funding for this position expires with the 2023/24 school year and we are assessing how to incorporate these activities and skill sets into the larger Safe Schools team. Additionally, staff are currently exploring the possibility of a crossing guard program.

| Where can we see data on:  |  |
| ● How many physical fights have occurred at each school? |  |
| ● How many incidents of sexual violence have occurred at each school? |  |
| ● How many incidents of substance abuse have occurred at each school? |  |
| ● How many total incidents have occurred at each school? |  |
| **See question #6 attachment.** |  |
| Data from the district’s Incident Response & Information System (IRIS) is being provided. It is important to note that this data represents incidents that caused significant disruption to a school environment. Other incidents that had less impact may only be reported in individual student records and would not be represented here. Additionally, the system does not categorize incidents matching each description requested, so staff have attempted to report the most appropriate data sets possible. |  |
| **7** | **LCAP PAC** |
| The district is doing great at reaching out to the community to invite their participation in various things such as Strategic Planning, dress code policy, and district committees. Has this expanded outreach resulted in increased participation? |  |
| **When considering total participation, it would be difficult to make comparisons as response rates vary based on a number of factors and are largely driven by the perceived level of importance or impact to participants.** |  |
| What can be demonstrated is that recent outreach efforts have resulted in greater participation across groups. For example, many recent efforts have included strategies such as direct presentations to district committees helping ensure their participation and diversity of voice in the conversation. Other strategies such as focus groups have yielded greater representation from traditionally underrepresented groups. |  |

## BOARD OF EDUCATION

### AGENDA ITEM: I-2
### MEETING DATE: 06/11/2024

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: San Juan Choices Charter School 2024-27 Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP)

**DEPARTMENT:** Admissions and Family Services

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board hold a public hearing regarding the Choices Charter School 2024-2027 LCAP. Action anticipated on June 25, 2024.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The LCAP includes eight state priority areas: Basic Services, Implementation of State Standards, Parent Involvement, Student Achievement, Student Engagement, School Climate, Course Access & Student Outcomes. The State of California requires extensive community and stakeholder input in the creation of the plan prior to bringing it forward to the Board of Education for action. Additionally, the state requires that a review of the State Accountability Dashboard be included as one source of data that informs the revised plan. This year’s 2024-2027 LCAP includes the 2023-24 LCAP Annual Update. The three-year LCAP must be board approved prior to the adoption of next year’s budget.

The LCFF gives school districts more flexibility in deciding how to use state funds. In exchange, school districts must work with parents, educators, students, and the community to develop a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP) that shows how they will use these funds to serve students.

Of that amount, $933,438 is tied to actions/services in the LCAP and $2,284,165 is not included in the LCAP. The budgeted expenditures that are not included in the LCAP will be used for the following:

In 2024-25, San Juan Choices Charter School is projecting it will receive $294,680 based on the enrollment of foster youth, English learner, and low-income students. San Juan Choices Charter School must describe how it intends to increase or improve services for high needs students in the LCAP. San Juan Choices Charter School plans to spend $763,198 towards meeting this requirement, as described in the LCAP.

# Update on Increased or Improved Services for High Needs Students in 2023-24

## Prior Year Expenditures: Increased or Improved Services for High Needs Students

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Total Budgeted Expenditures for High Needs Students in the LCAP | $520,574 |
| Actual Expenditures for High Needs Students in LCAP | $431,074 |

This chart compares what San Juan Choices Charter School budgeted last year in the LCAP for actions and services that contribute to increasing or improving services for high needs students with what San Juan Choices Charter School estimates it has spent on actions and services that contribute to increasing or improving services for high needs students in the current year.

The text description of the above chart is as follows: In 2023-24, San Juan Choices Charter School's LCAP budgeted $520,574 for planned actions to increase or improve services for high needs students. San Juan Choices Charter School actually spent $431,074 for actions to increase or improve services for high needs students in 2023-24.

The difference between the budgeted and actual expenditures of -$89,500 had the following impact on San Juan Choices Charter School’s ability to increase or improve services for high needs students:

In 2023-24, some of our planned expenditures and actions were accomplished using grant funds. Other action items took longer than anticipated to research and design and were postponed for implementation until the 2024-25 school year. We also experienced delays due to our WASC accreditation review which required a significant investment in time and personnel.

![Goal Analysis](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Goal+Analysis)

**Goal Analysis**  
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year.  
A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

**Actions/Services Not Implemented as Planned:**

Due to evolving resources and perspectives, the following planned LCAP services were offered in a different format or paused in 2023-24:

**Tutoring:**

Creation and maintenance of online tutoring schedule where students reserve one-on-one tutoring sessions in specific subject areas with specific faculty members (10 Director hours per year + 2 Community Outreach Worker hours per week + 10 Faculty hours per week)  
- Some research was conducted on this topic, but the launch of the online tutoring schedule was postponed to Fall 2024.

**College & Career Planning Support:**

Develop a second CTE Pathway in Public Services / Public Safety or Arts, Media, & Entertainment. (4 Faculty hours per week)  
- This activity was postponed to 2024-25.

Host on-campus speakers who will share information about their professions and the entrance requirements in their fields. Posters about guest speakers to be featured around the school. (40 Community Liaison hours per year)  
- Two guest speakers were hosted during College & Career Week; due to low student attendance, the series planned for the remainder of the year was tabled.

Provide at least ten off-campus graduation- and college/career-oriented field trips available to high school students each year. This includes, but is not limited to, Sacramento Speaker Series events, the SJUSD College Fair, CSU Sacramento College Fair, college visits (American River College, CSU Sacramento, UC Davis), and Grad Night. Field trips to colleges/universities include visits to the Disabilities Services and Programs for Students (DSPS) and Financial Aid offices when possible. (60 Faculty hours per year + 60 Counselor hours per year)  
- Field trips to colleges/universities were postponed to 2024-25. However, ten field trips were offered, including the addition of a trip to SJUSD's Historically Black Colleges & Universities Recruitment Fair.

**2024 LCAP Annual Update for the 2023-24 LCAP for San Juan Choices Charter School**  
Page 13 of 97
<!-- Page 522 -->
# Community Enhancements:

- Provide at least one grade-specific field trip each year in grades 6, 7 & 8. (30 Faculty hours per year)
  - Just one field trip in sixth grade was offered in 2023-24 due to resource constraints. An all-grades bowling field trip included both middle and high school students.

- Virtual Reality Science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics) Labs (2 Faculty hours per week + cost of curriculum)
  - This activity was postponed to 2024-25 due to resource constraints.

- Create and implement rewards systems to acknowledge students’ academic progress, as well as to celebrate growth and strong character, throughout the school year (1 Director hour per week + 1 Administrative Assistant hour per week + 3 Faculty hours per week)
  - This activity was postponed to 2024-25.

# Technology Resources:

- No substantive differences.

# Miscellaneous Support:

- Continue to provide intervention services for students who struggle academically and/or socially. Advisory Teachers implement a new official intervention process at the close of each log period. (18 Community Liaison hours per week + 18 Counselor hours per week +9 Assistant Director hours per week + 40 Faculty hours per week)
  - Though some progress in this area was made, more progress is needed in 2024-25 for consistent implementation of a formalized process.

- Provide four in-person, evening training sessions for parents: use of School Pathways, PLP, and best practices for supporting an independent study student. (40 Director hours per year)
  - These activities were tabled due to and anticipated low attendance rate.

- Build an email message template and demonstration video that teachers and Community Outreach Worker can use to teach parents how to use PLP effectively. (5 Director hours + 5 Assistant Director hours + 5 Community Liaison hours per year)
  - This activity was postponed to 2024-25.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services

In 2023-24, due largely to the demands associated with addressing a full WASC accreditation review, fewer than anticipated new activities were implemented with the use of LCFF funds. However, most LCAP activities were executed as planned, and estimated actual expenditures remained well above 2023-24 LCFF requirements.

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.

No data is yet available for the 2023-24 school year. However, given that most of the actions/services that Choices provided in 2023-24 are the same or very similar to those provided in recent previous years, data from 2020-23 provides some direction in evaluating the effectiveness of CCS’s efforts to provide student services in an equitable manner. Some data types have been unavailable in recent years, and data for English Learners and Foster Youth are often not published due to insufficient sample sizes. However, the data that is available is largely positive:

- **Graduation Rate:** The Graduation Rates of All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students grew in 2020, 2021, and 2022 and then settled slightly in 2023. The Graduation Rates of each group have remained nearly equal or equal (2022) to one another, demonstrating equity of the Choices Charter program. Slightly more than half (52%) of 2023 graduates stated that they would not have graduated from high school had they not enrolled at Choices.

- **CAASPP (ELA SBA, Math SBA, and Science CAST):** In 2023, Choices students exceeded state proficiency rates in Science and, for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, in ELA. All student groups lagged behind the state in Math for a second consecutive year. In ELA and Math, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students scored as well as All Students, but English Learners lagged significantly behind. In Science, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students lagged behind All Students only slightly, and English Learners scored significantly ahead of All Students.

In 2023, when CAASPP scores were not as strong as they previously were, CAASPP Student Survey results revealed that 70% of the students who took the CAASPP exams had been enrolled at Choices for less than one school year. In fact, 56% of testers had enrolled in the same semester that the tests were administered. Both figures were at an all-time high in 2023 and far exceeded the previous years’ figures when approximately half of tested students had been enrolled at Choices for less than a year (approximately 30% enrolling during the semester of testing). This suggests that test scores in 2023 were largely a reflection of the education that students received at their previous schools.

**College Career Indicator:** The College Career Indicator (“CCI”) for both All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students grew in 2020. Both student groups experienced drops when the CCI was published again in 2023 after a three-year hiatus. Nearly three-fourths

(73%) of 2023 graduates planned to immediately enroll in colleges or trade schools, and nearly all (91%) of 2023 graduates felt prepared for college and a career.

Thanks to a growing focus on Choices’ college and career readiness opportunities, such as A-G courses, co-enrollment at community colleges, a Career Technical Education Pathway in Business & Finance, and two World Language tracks that lead to biliteracy, more Choices students are expected to be considered “Prepared” for college and career each year.

Chronic Absenteeism: No Chronic Absenteeism (grades 6-8) data for English Learners was available in years 2020-2023. For Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, achievement gaps grew in 2021 and remained steady through 2023.

The LCAP Actions associated with Goal 1 were successful as demonstrated in 2023 by equity in Graduation Rates and academic proficiency levels on CAASPP for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students in ELA, Math, and Science, and for English Learners in Science. The Actions may be deemed as unsuccessful in that the achievement gaps between Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students and All Students on the College/Career Indicator and with Chronic Absenteeism rates have not been reduced in recent years.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

In 2024-25, Choices Charter School's LCAP goals will be substantially redesigned to align with those of its chartering school district, San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD). Educational partners will provide feedback based on LCAP metrics data that will inform decisions about which actions will remain and which will be discontinued in the coming year. Choices will seek to include more locally collected data points to use as additional metrics that may more accurately reflect student progress at Choices.

## Goal Analysis
An analysis of how this goal was carried out in the previous year. A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.

- **Identify, Support, and Track Progress of Students with Anxiety**  
  No substantive differences.

- **Mental Health Support for Students**  
  No substantive differences.

All planned actions/services were implemented for Goal 2 in 2023-24. No new actions/services were added to this goal in 2023-24.

An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.

There were no material differences between planned and actual services or expenditures for Goal 2 in 2023-24.

An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.

Students with Disabilities Attitude Survey: The percentage of Students with Disabilities who believed that their anxiety levels had dropped since enrolling at Choices dropped in 2022 and then grew again in 2023 but not enough to reach desired outcomes.

Student School Satisfaction Survey: The percentage of All Students who believed that their anxiety levels had dropped since enrolling at Choices dropped in 2021 and then grew again in 2022 and 2023 but not enough to reach desired outcomes. The percentage of students who reported that they feel safe on campus grew in 2021, plateaued in 2022, and then dropped slightly in 2023; in all years, the desired outcome percentage was achieved.

The Choices Charter School LCAP’s Goal 2 Actions may be deemed effective in that nearly all students (98%) felt safe on campus in 2023, and because this percentage is so high, it is safe to deduce that it includes nearly all Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, English Learners, and Foster Youth at Choices. While anxiety levels did not drop at Choices as much as hoped during and immediately following the COVID-19 campus closure, the percentages of All Students and Students with Disabilities surveyed in 2023 who felt that their anxiety levels had dropped since enrolling at Choices grew. It is believed that the pandemic further destabilized students, preventing Choices from reaching the objectives it originally set regarding anxiety levels by 2023. 2024 Students with Disabilities Attitude Survey data and Student School Satisfaction Survey data may show growth that will equal or surpass the ultimate desired outcomes.

A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.

In 2024-25, Choices Charter School's LCAP goals will be substantially redesigned to align with those of its chartering school district, San Juan Unified School District (SJUSD). Educational partners will provide feedback based on LCAP metrics data that will inform decisions about which actions will remain and which will be discontinued in the coming year. Choices will seek to include more locally collected data points to use as additional metrics that may more accurately reflect student progress at Choices.

A report of the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for last year’s actions may be found in the Annual Update Table. A report of the Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services for last year’s actions may be found in the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table.

**Goal Analysis**

Using actual annual measurable outcome data, including data from the Dashboard, analyze whether the planned actions were effective in achieving the goal. Respond to the prompts as instructed.

- **A description of any substantive differences in planned actions and actual implementation of these actions.**
  - Describe the overall implementation of the actions to achieve the articulated goal. Include a discussion of relevant challenges and successes experienced with the implementation process. This must include any instance where the LEA did not implement a planned action or implemented a planned action in a manner that differs substantively from how it was described in the adopted LCAP.

- **An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.**
  - Explain material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and between the Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services, as applicable. Minor variances in expenditures or percentages do not need to be addressed, and a dollar-for-dollar accounting is not required.

- **An explanation of how effective or ineffective the specific actions were in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle.**
  - Describe the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions in making progress toward the goal during the three-year LCAP cycle. “Effectiveness” means the degree to which the actions were successful in producing the desired result and “ineffectiveness” means that the actions did not produce any significant or desired result.
    - In some cases, not all actions in a goal will be intended to improve performance on all of the metrics associated with the goal.
      - When responding to this prompt, LEAs may assess the effectiveness of a single action or group of actions within the goal in the context of performance on a single metric or group of specific metrics within the goal that are applicable to the action(s).
      - Grouping actions with metrics will allow for more robust analysis of whether the strategy the LEA is using to impact a specified set of metrics is working and increase transparency for educational partners. LEAs are encouraged to use such an approach when goals include multiple actions and metrics that are not closely associated.
      - Beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period.

- **A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, desired outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.**
  - Describe any changes made to this goal, expected outcomes, metrics, or actions to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis and analysis of the data provided in the Dashboard or other local data, as applicable.
    - As noted above, beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period. For actions that have been identified as ineffective, the LEA must identify the ineffective action and must include a description of the following:
      - The reasons for the ineffectiveness, and
      - How changes to the action will result in a new or strengthened approach.

**Plan Summary [2024-25]**

**General Information**  
A description of the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades transitional kindergarten–12, as applicable to the LEA.

Choices Charter School (CCS or Choices) is a 6-12 Independent Study School that involves parents/guardians as partners in the education of their children. A highly-qualified and dedicated faculty educates a diverse population of students. Choices serves students effectively with its flexible, personalized learning model and the safety that a small, nurturing learning community provides.

Students typically enroll at Choices because the traditional school model does not fit their needs. Students often want a greater sense of control over their education, prefer a smaller learning environment, struggle with overwhelming family challenges and responsibilities, have experienced undesirable social dynamics in a traditional school program, wish to graduate early or catch up on credits that they lack, or face health challenges. Some students are busy on weekdays cultivating a special skill or working. Choices staff members meet students where they are academically and seek to provide educational opportunities that challenge them appropriately, resulting in successes that build confidence and motivation. Students typically feel respected and “seen” at Choices and become more engaged in their education, as a result.

All Choices students utilize online curriculum that is aligned with California Content Standards and Common Core Standards and is available 24 hours a day. Student attendance is defined by the completion of assigned work; attendance on campus is not required. However, many students enjoy learning in person, too, and Choices provides onsite support classes to address this need. The Choices program is highly customizable. Some students may choose to follow a “pure” independent study format that involves no attendance in in-person instructional settings. Others may choose to follow a hybrid learning option that involves one-to-two hours of in-person, on-campus instruction per course, per week. Still others may choose to define their own plan that blends the two models, perhaps, for example, attending class for a few courses and learning online-only for others. Those who do attend in-person support classes experience individualized support, meaningful relationships with faculty, social interaction with peers, and collaborative learning that enhances the curriculum available to them online.

Choices students benefit from A-G coursework, a CTE Pathway in Business & Finance, AP and Honors courses, a choice of two World Languages, the opportunity to enroll in community college courses, and a wide variety of engaging elective classes, designated curriculum for

![Reflections: Annual Performance](https://example.com/image.png)

**Reflections: Annual Performance**  
A reflection on annual performance based on a review of the California School Dashboard (Dashboard) and local data.

Though 2024 data is not yet available, Choices Charter School is proud of its students’ progress in academic achievement, college and career readiness, and emotional well-being, which is demonstrated by data from 2023 and previous recent years. Due to small sample sizes, to protect the privacy of individual students, data results for English Learners (6%) and Foster Youth (2%) are typically not reported publicly; most data highlighted here focuses on the successes of All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students (54%).

- **Graduation Rate:** Many students enroll at CCS deficient in credits, due to difficulties at their previous schools, and often need an extra semester or year to finish high school. At Choices, most students can recover their credits and continue to graduation in five years or less. The Graduation Rate climbed steadily for All Students and for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students between 2019 and 2022 and then settled slightly in 2023. The Graduation Rates for each student group are nearly equal or to one another in each year, indicating that all students are served equitably at Choices.

- **Academic Achievement:** (CAASPP ELA SBA, Math SBA, and Science CAST: CAASPP Student Survey; i-Ready): In 2021, Choices students performed very well on the SBA and CAST, exceeding state proficiency rates in nearly all categories. Disadvantaged student subgroups also exceeded proficiency of All Students in almost all categories. Significant gains in proficiency by all student groups in 2021 seemed to suggest that modified, shorter SBA exams given in 2021 were less challenging than the standard version that was administered in 2019. However, State of California data shows that students of all subgroups experienced declines in performance, on average, across the state in 2021. In fact, Choices Students not only improved in 2021; they significantly outperformed the state proficiency rates in nearly all categories. Choices students may have fared better than most students in the state, due to consistency in curriculum and instruction and dedicated outreach to families throughout 2020 and 2021. Whereas traditional schools often struggled to adjust to distance learning conditions, Choices was able to transition nearly seamlessly. In 2022, Choices students continued to exceed state proficiency rates in ELA and nearly all student group categories in Science. All student groups lagged behind the state in Math, however. In most cases, disadvantaged student subgroups lagged behind All Students in proficiency rates. In 2023, Choices students exceeded state proficiency rates in Science and, for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, in ELA. All student groups lagged behind the state in Math for a second consecutive year. In ELA and
<!-- Page 533 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

Math, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students scored as well as All Students, but English Learners lagged significantly behind. In Science, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students lagged behind All Students only slightly, and English Learners scored significantly ahead of All Students. SBA and CAST performance and achievement gaps between All Students and disadvantaged student subgroups have fluctuated over time. Due to small sample sizes, statistics often change significantly from year to year. Multiple years of data are studied to identify trends. The data above seems to suggest that distance learning significantly benefited Choices students - especially in Math - and was particularly effective at educating Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, as well as English Learners. Though Choices takes its standardized test scores very seriously, we also must remember that they are not necessarily a strong indicator of the strength of the Choices program. For example, in 2023, when CAASPP scores were not as strong as they previously were, CAASPP Student Survey results revealed that 70% of the students who took the CAASPP exams had been enrolled at Choices for less than one school year. In fact, 56% of testers had enrolled in the same semester that the tests were administered. Both figures were at an all-time high in 2023, and far exceeded the previous years’ figures when approximately half of tested students had been enrolled at Choices for less than a year (approximately 30% enrolling during the semester of testing). This suggests that test scores in 2023 were largely a reflection of the education that students received at their previous schools. Fall 2022 i-Ready data demonstrated that, when students are continuously enrolled for even just one semester, they experience significant growth in Math and stabilization or moderate growth in ELA.

- **College & Career Readiness (College Career Indicator, Student School Satisfaction Survey, Students with Disabilities Attitude Survey, Senior Exit Survey)**: Many students enrolled at CCS behind in high school course credits and/or unsure about their futures. While at Choices, students are supported in their coursework, offered credit recovery classes, and encouraged to explore electives and extracurricular activities that may spark interests and provide direction. Students are encouraged to consider and prepare for college and career through Graduation Outcomes focused on high school graduation and post-secondary goals, annual College & Career Week activities, college/career assignments in each class, field trips, a CTE Pathway in Business & Finance, grade-level classroom presentations, college/career readiness pathway guidance during class registration each semester, a breadth of core and elective course offerings, and individual counseling support. Fifty-two percent (52%) of 2023 CCS graduates indicated on a Senior Exit Survey that they believe that they would not have graduated from high school at all, had they not enrolled at Choices. Seventy-three percent (73%) of 2023 graduates planned to attend college or trade school in the coming four-to-five years. These statistics speak to the ability of the CCS program to rehabilitate learners and guide them to their next educational endeavors. The CA State College/Career Indicator showed that 44% of Californian students were “Prepared” for college and career in 2023, a much higher percentage than experienced at Choices (11%). CCS has been working to build its percentage each year, primarily through improving SBA test preparation techniques, the new availability of a Career Technical Education Pathway in Business & Finance, and continued availability of A-G, AP, and World Languages courses. CCS has recently modified its Graduation Outcomes to focus on reaching goals, modeled through the process of approaching high school graduation and post-secondary endeavors. Most CCS Students plan to attend community college or trade schools or have other undeclared plans for after high school - paths that do not require the completion of a specific college/career pathway. However, since Spring 2021, students have been guided in choosing and following a path that will designate them as “Prepared” for career success and/or enrollment in four-year universities, should they ultimately choose one of these options. Internally collected data suggests that more students are thinking about pursuing additional education after high school graduation and nearly all feel ready to take on the next steps. On the 2023 Student School Satisfaction Survey, 87% of students stated that they want to go to college/vocational school (up from 73% in the previous year), and on the 2023 Students with Disabilities Attitude Survey, 66% of surveyed students stated that they wanted to go to college /

- **Student Anxiety Levels (New Student Survey, Student School Satisfaction Survey)**: Student anxiety has been a growing concern in today’s schools, and Choices has been committed to doing all that it can to meet the needs of a sizable subgroup of anxious students. On average, between 2019 and 2022, 22% of new students reported that “social/other anxiety” was one of the main reasons that they moved to Choices. The flexible, small, nurturing program at Choices provides a learning environment that effectively stabilizes or reduces the anxiety that many students feel about school. Expanded mental health services and augmented faculty outreach to students in 2020-21 and 2021-22 provided additional support for students who struggled during the pandemic. Nearly all students report that their anxiety levels are the same or lower than before they enrolled; in most cases, more than half of students have reported a drop in their anxiety levels. Sample sizes are small, and this data point will continue to be watched over multiple years to identify ongoing trends.

- **Chronic Absenteeism**: At Choices and throughout the state, Chronic Absenteeism rates rose dramatically during and immediately following the COVID-19 campus closure in 2020-21. Chronic Absenteeism at Choices has been dropping slightly each year and is aligned with state figures. Like throughout the state, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students and English Learners experience greater rates of Chronic Absenteeism than All Students. Chronic Absenteeism rates for English Learners are more volatile at Choices due to a very small sample size.

- **English Language Proficiency of English Learners (ELPAC)**: At Choices, English Learners are guided in language development through enrollment in an English Language Development (ELD) course. In 2022-23, a new ELD curriculum, Learning Tree, was piloted and is being used again in 2023-24. In 2023-24, an additional ELD support class was added to the schedule in order to reduce class sizes and group together students of similar grade levels. Upon enrollment, English Learners are also encouraged to enroll in classroom-based elective courses and to participate in extracurricular activities, promoting presence in collaborative environments that will build listening and speaking skills. English Learners comprise just 6% of the Choices student population, and typically, fewer than eleven students produce scores on the summative ELPAC assessment each year. In order to protect individual students’ privacy, ELPAC scores are not published publicly when the sample size is small. In 2023, for the first time, more than ten students took the ELPAC exam, and group scores were made available online. In 2022-23 at Choices, a lower percentage of English Learners progressed to a higher level of English proficiency than they did in the state, but a greater percentage of English Learners maintained their existing proficiency levels, and a lower percentage of English Learners dropped a level or more. This data demonstrates that English Learners stabilize, sometimes grow, and rarely lose skills while at Choices.

Choices is very pleased with the growth and equity reflected in its Graduation Rate, CAASPP scores, i-Ready scores, College Career Indicator, Chronic Absenteeism data, ELPAC data, and encouraging and validating locally collected survey data. However, standardized data that lags behind corresponding state averages continues to point to areas of need. In 2023, the Graduation Rates of All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students were lower than corresponding state averages, as were the percentages of All Students, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students, and “Ever-EL” English Learners who met or exceeded standard on the CAASPP Math SBA and the percentages of All Students and "Ever-EL" English Learners on the ELA SBA. The California State average College Career Indicator is

also significantly higher for All Students and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students than it is at Choices. The recent changes in Chronic Absenteeism Rates, which have increased at Choices and are now settling, have moved in tandem with those of the state.

Building Choices’ students’ Math proficiency and college and career readiness are primary areas of focus at Choices, based on student data. LCAP funds will continue to target these areas of need where Choices expects to continue experiencing incremental growth.

# Engaging Educational Partners

A summary of the process used to engage educational partners in the development of the LCAP.

School districts and county offices of education must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, local bargaining units, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.

Charter schools must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.

An LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also consult with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for each applicable school.

**Identified Need(s)**  
ELPAC data demonstrates that English Learners tend to stabilize at Choices but few grow in English proficiency.  
The California School Dashboard's College Career Indicator for Choices Charter lags significantly behind the state.  
Of particular concern, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students at Choices had a Red Dashboard Indicator for Math in 2023.  
**Scope:**  
Schoolwide  

**2.1 Action:**  
Programs that Engage Students in Education  
**Need:**  
Most students stabilize academically at Choices and are able to graduate within five years. In 2023, 52% of graduates reported that they did not believe that they would have graduated from high school had they not enrolled at Choices. 73% of those same graduates planned to move on to post-secondary educational pursuits, such as community college, university, or trade school. The Graduation Rates for All Students and for Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Students are nearly equal, demonstrating the equity of the Choices program. However, the CCS Graduation Rates for each group lag behind the state, and CCS would like to reduce these achievement gaps.  
**Scope:**  
Schoolwide  

Choices Charter believes that student engagement in learning is founded largely on the relevance of school programs, courses, and activities to students' interests and lives. Engagement practices are important in reaching all students and may be especially meaningful for students in disadvantaged student subgroups.  

**Metric(s) to Monitor Effectiveness**

## Introduction and Instructions

The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) requires local educational agencies (LEAs) to engage their local educational partners in an annual planning process to evaluate their progress within eight state priority areas encompassing all statutory metrics (COEs have 10 state priorities). LEAs document the results of this planning process in the LCAP using the template adopted by the State Board of Education.

The LCAP development process serves three distinct, but related functions:

- **Comprehensive Strategic Planning**: The process of developing and annually updating the LCAP supports comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the California School Dashboard (California Education Code [EC] Section 52064[e][1]). Strategic planning that is comprehensive connects budgetary decisions to teaching and learning performance data. LEAs should continually evaluate the hard choices they make about the use of limited resources to meet student and community needs to ensure opportunities and outcomes are improved for all students.

- **Meaningful Engagement of Educational Partners**: The LCAP development process should result in an LCAP that reflects decisions made through meaningful engagement (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Local educational partners possess valuable perspectives and insights about an LEA's programs and services. Effective strategic planning will incorporate these perspectives and insights in order to identify potential goals and actions to be included in the LCAP.

- **Accountability and Compliance**: The LCAP serves an important accountability function because the nature of some LCAP template sections require LEAs to show that they have complied with various requirements specified in the LCFF statutes and regulations, most notably:
  - Demonstrating that LEAs are increasing or improving services for foster youth, English learners, including long-term English learners, and low-income students in proportion to the amount of additional funding those students generate under LCFF (EC Section 52064[b][4-6]).

<!-- Page 576 -->
![2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School](https://example.com/image.png)

- Establishing goals, supported by actions and related expenditures, that address the statutory priority areas and statutory metrics (EC sections 52064[b][1] and [2]).
  - NOTE: As specified in EC Section 62064(b)(1), the LCAP must provide a description of the annual goals, for all pupils and each subgroup of pupils identified pursuant to EC Section 52052, to be achieved for each of the state priorities. Beginning in 2023–24, EC Section 52052 identifies long-term English learners as a separate and distinct pupil subgroup with a numerical significance at 15 students.
  
- Annually reviewing and updating the LCAP to reflect progress toward the goals (EC Section 52064[b][7]).

- Ensuring that all increases attributable to supplemental and concentration grant calculations, including concentration grant add-on funding and/or LCFF carryover, are reflected in the LCAP (EC sections 52064[b][6], [8], and [11]).

The LCAP template, like each LEA’s final adopted LCAP, is a document, not a process. LEAs must use the template to memorialize the outcome of their LCAP development process, which must: (a) reflect comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the California School Dashboard (Dashboard), (b) through meaningful engagement with educational partners that (c) meets legal requirements, as reflected in the final adopted LCAP. The sections included within the LCAP template do not and cannot reflect the full development process, just as the LCAP template itself is not intended as a tool for engaging educational partners.

If a county superintendent of schools has jurisdiction over a single school district, the county board of education and the governing board of the school district may adopt and file for review and approval a single LCAP consistent with the requirements in EC sections 52060, 52062, 52066, 52068, and 52070. The LCAP must clearly articulate to which entity’s budget (school district or county superintendent of schools) all budgeted and actual expenditures are aligned.

The revised LCAP template for the 2024–25, 2025–26, and 2026–27 school years reflects statutory changes made through Senate Bill 114 (Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review), Chapter 48, Statutes of 2023.

At its most basic, the adopted LCAP should attempt to distill not just what the LEA is doing for students in transitional kindergarten through grade twelve (TK–12), but also allow educational partners to understand what and why, and whether those strategies are leading to improved opportunities and outcomes for students. LEAs are strongly encouraged to use language and a level of detail in their adopted LCAPs intended to be meaningful and accessible for the LEA’s diverse educational partners and the broader public.

In developing and finalizing the LCAP for adoption, LEAs are encouraged to keep the following overarching frame at the forefront of the strategic planning and educational partner engagement functions:

Given present performance across the state priorities and on indicators in the Dashboard, how is the LEA using its budgetary resources to respond to TK–12 student and community needs, and address any performance gaps, including by meeting its obligation to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, and low-income students?
<!-- Page 577 -->
![Page 69 of 97](https://example.com/image.png)

LEAs are encouraged to focus on a set of metrics and actions which, based on research, experience, and input gathered from educational partners, the LEA believes will have the biggest impact on behalf of its TK–12 students.

These instructions address the requirements for each section of the LCAP, but may include information about effective practices when developing the LCAP and completing the LCAP document. Additionally, the beginning of each template section includes information emphasizing the purpose that section serves.

## Plan Summary

### Purpose
A well-developed Plan Summary section provides a meaningful context for the LCAP. This section provides information about an LEA’s community as well as relevant information about student needs and performance. In order to present a meaningful context for the rest of the LCAP, the content of this section should be clearly and meaningfully related to the content included throughout each subsequent section of the LCAP.

### Requirements and Instructions

#### General Information
A description of the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades transitional kindergarten–12, as applicable to the LEA.

Briefly describe the LEA, its schools, and its students in grades TK–12, as applicable to the LEA.

- For example, information about an LEA in terms of geography, enrollment, employment, the number and size of specific schools, recent community challenges, and other such information the LEA may wish to include can enable a reader to more fully understand the LEA’s LCAP.
  
- As part of this response, identify all schools within the LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funding.

#### Reflections: Annual Performance
A reflection on annual performance based on a review of the California School Dashboard (Dashboard) and local data.

Reflect on the LEA’s annual performance on the Dashboard and local data. This may include both successes and challenges identified by the LEA during the development process.

LEAs are encouraged to highlight how they are addressing the identified needs of student groups, and/or schools within the LCAP as part of this response.

As part of this response, the LEA must identify the following, which will remain unchanged during the three-year LCAP cycle:

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 69 of 97
<!-- Page 578 -->
- Any school within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard;
- Any student group within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard; and/or
- Any student group within a school within the LEA that received the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the 2023 Dashboard.

**Reflections: Technical Assistance**  
As applicable, a summary of the work underway as part of technical assistance.

Annually identify the reason(s) the LEA is eligible for or has requested technical assistance consistent with EC sections 47607.3, 52071, 52071.5, 52072, or 52072.5, and provide a summary of the work underway as part of receiving technical assistance. The most common form of this technical assistance is frequently referred to as Differentiated Assistance; however, this also includes LEAs that have requested technical assistance from their COE.

- If the LEA is not eligible for or receiving technical assistance, the LEA may respond to this prompt as “Not Applicable.”

**Comprehensive Support and Improvement**  
An LEA with a school or schools identified for comprehensive support and improvement (CSI) under the Every Student Succeeds Act must respond to the following prompts:

**Schools Identified**  
A list of the schools in the LEA that are eligible for comprehensive support and improvement.

- Identify the schools within the LEA that have been identified for CSI.

**Support for Identified Schools**  
A description of how the LEA has or will support its eligible schools in developing comprehensive support and improvement plans.

- Describe how the LEA has or will support the identified schools in developing CSI plans that included a school-level needs assessment, evidence-based interventions, and the identification of any resource inequities to be addressed through the implementation of the CSI plan.

**Monitoring and Evaluating Effectiveness**  
A description of how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the plan to support student and school improvement.

- Describe how the LEA will monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the CSI plan to support student and school improvement.

# Engaging Educational Partners

## Purpose
Significant and purposeful engagement of parents, students, educators, and other educational partners, including those representing the student groups identified by LCFF, is critical to the development of the LCAP and the budget process. Consistent with statute, such engagement should support comprehensive strategic planning, particularly to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the Dashboard, accountability, and improvement across the state priorities and locally identified priorities (EC Section 52064[e][1]). Engagement of educational partners is an ongoing, annual process.

This section is designed to reflect how the engagement of educational partners influenced the decisions reflected in the adopted LCAP. The goal is to allow educational partners that participated in the LCAP development process and the broader public to understand how the LEA engaged educational partners and the impact of that engagement. LEAs are encouraged to keep this goal in the forefront when completing this section.

## Requirements
### School districts and COEs:
EC sections 52060(g) (California Legislative Information) and 52066(g) (California Legislative Information) specify the educational partners that must be consulted when developing the LCAP:

- Teachers,
- Principals,
- Administrators,
- Other school personnel,
- Local bargaining units of the LEA,
- Parents, and
- Students

A school district or COE receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also consult with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for each applicable school.

Before adopting the LCAP, school districts and COEs must share it with the applicable committees, as identified below under Requirements and Instructions. The superintendent is required by statute to respond in writing to the comments received from these committees. School districts and COEs must also consult with the special education local plan area administrator(s) when developing the LCAP.

### Charter schools:
EC Section 47606.5(d) (California Legislative Information) requires that the following educational partners be consulted with when developing the LCAP:

- Teachers,

---

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 71 of 97
<!-- Page 580 -->
- Principals,  
- Administrators,  
- Other school personnel,  
- Parents, and  
- Students  

A charter school receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also consult with educational partners at the school generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for the school.

The LCAP should also be shared with, and LEAs should request input from, schoolsite-level advisory groups, as applicable (e.g., schoolsite councils, English Learner Advisory Councils, student advisory groups, etc.), to facilitate alignment between schoolsite and district-level goals. Information and resources that support effective engagement, define student consultation, and provide the requirements for advisory group composition, can be found under Resources on the CDE’s LCAP webpage.

Before the governing board/body of an LEA considers the adoption of the LCAP, the LEA must meet the following legal requirements:

- For school districts, see Education Code Section 52062 (California Legislative Information);  
  - Note: Charter schools using the LCAP as the School Plan for Student Achievement must meet the requirements of EC Section 52062(a).  

- For COEs, see Education Code Section 52068 (California Legislative Information); and  

- For charter schools, see Education Code Section 47606.5 (California Legislative Information).  

- NOTE: As a reminder, the superintendent of a school district or COE must respond, in writing, to comments received by the applicable committees identified in the Education Code sections listed above. This includes the parent advisory committee and may include the English learner parent advisory committee and, as of July 1, 2024, the student advisory committee, as applicable.  

Instructions  
Respond to the prompts as follows:  

A summary of the process used to engage educational partners in the development of the LCAP.  
School districts and county offices of education must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, local bargaining units, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.  
Charter schools must, at a minimum, consult with teachers, principals, administrators, other school personnel, parents, and students in the development of the LCAP.

**Complete the table as follows:**

**Educational Partners**  
Identify the applicable educational partner(s) or group(s) that were engaged in the development of the LCAP.

**Process for Engagement**  
Describe the engagement process used by the LEA to involve the identified educational partner(s) in the development of the LCAP. At a minimum, the LEA must describe how it met its obligation to consult with all statutorily required educational partners, as applicable to the type of LEA.  
- A sufficient response to this prompt must include general information about the timeline of the process and meetings or other engagement strategies with educational partners. A response may also include information about an LEA’s philosophical approach to engaging its educational partners.  
- An LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funds must also include a summary of how it consulted with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds in the development of the LCAP, specifically, in the development of the required focus goal for each applicable school.

**A description of how the adopted LCAP was influenced by the feedback provided by educational partners.**  
Describe any goals, metrics, actions, or budgeted expenditures in the LCAP that were influenced by or developed in response to the educational partner feedback.  
- A sufficient response to this prompt will provide educational partners and the public with clear, specific information about how the engagement process influenced the development of the LCAP. This may include a description of how the LEA prioritized requests of educational partners within the context of the budgetary resources available or otherwise prioritized areas of focus within the LCAP.  
- An LEA receiving Equity Multiplier funds must include a description of how the consultation with educational partners at schools generating Equity Multiplier funds influenced the development of the adopted LCAP.  
- For the purposes of this prompt, this may also include, but is not necessarily limited to:  
  - Inclusion of a goal or decision to pursue a Focus Goal (as described below)  
  - Inclusion of metrics other than the statutorily required metrics  
  - Determination of the target outcome on one or more metrics  
  - Inclusion of performance by one or more student groups in the Measuring and Reporting Results subsection  

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 73 of 97
<!-- Page 582 -->
- Inclusion of action(s) or a group of actions
- Elimination of action(s) or group of actions
- Changes to the level of proposed expenditures for one or more actions
- Inclusion of action(s) as contributing to increased or improved services for unduplicated students
- Analysis of effectiveness of the specific actions to achieve the goal
- Analysis of material differences in expenditures
- Analysis of changes made to a goal for the ensuing LCAP year based on the annual update process
- Analysis of challenges or successes in the implementation of actions

## Goals and Actions

### Purpose
Well-developed goals will clearly communicate to educational partners what the LEA plans to accomplish, what the LEA plans to do in order to accomplish the goal, and how the LEA will know when it has accomplished the goal. A goal statement, associated metrics and expected outcomes, and the actions included in the goal must be in alignment. The explanation for why the LEA included a goal is an opportunity for LEAs to clearly communicate to educational partners and the public why, among the various strengths and areas for improvement highlighted by performance data and strategies and actions that could be pursued, the LEA decided to pursue this goal, and the related metrics, expected outcomes, actions, and expenditures.

A well-developed goal can be focused on the performance relative to a metric or metrics for all students, a specific student group(s), narrowing performance gaps, or implementing programs or strategies expected to impact outcomes. LEAs should assess the performance of their student groups when developing goals and the related actions to achieve such goals.

### Requirements and Instructions
LEAs should prioritize the goals, specific actions, and related expenditures included within the LCAP within one or more state priorities. LEAs must consider performance on the state and local indicators, including their locally collected and reported data for the local indicators that are included in the Dashboard, in determining whether and how to prioritize its goals within the LCAP. As previously stated, strategic planning that is comprehensive connects budgetary decisions to teaching and learning performance data. LEAs should continually evaluate the hard choices they make about the use of limited resources to meet student and community needs to ensure opportunities and outcomes are improved for all students, and to address and reduce disparities in opportunities and outcomes between student groups indicated by the Dashboard.

In order to support prioritization of goals, the LCAP template provides LEAs with the option of developing three different kinds of goals:

- **Focus Goal:** A Focus Goal is relatively more concentrated in scope and may focus on a fewer number of metrics to measure improvement. A Focus Goal statement will be time bound and make clear how the goal is to be measured.
  - All Equity Multiplier goals must be developed as focus goals. For additional information, see Required Focus Goal(s) for LEAs Receiving Equity Multiplier Funding below.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 74 of 97
<!-- Page 583 -->
- **Broad Goal:** A Broad Goal is relatively less concentrated in its scope and may focus on improving performance across a wide range of metrics.

- **Maintenance of Progress Goal:** A Maintenance of Progress Goal includes actions that may be ongoing without significant changes and allows an LEA to track performance on any metrics not addressed in the other goals of the LCAP.

### Requirement to Address the LCFF State Priorities
At a minimum, the LCAP must address all LCFF priorities and associated metrics articulated in EC sections 52060(d) and 52066(d), as applicable to the LEA. The LCFF State Priorities Summary provides a summary of EC sections 52060(d) and 52066(d) to aid in the development of the LCAP.

Respond to the following prompts, as applicable:

### Focus Goal(s)

**Description**  
The description provided for a Focus Goal must be specific, measurable, and time bound.
- An LEA develops a Focus Goal to address areas of need that may require or benefit from a more specific and data intensive approach.
- The Focus Goal can explicitly reference the metric(s) by which achievement of the goal will be measured and the time frame according to which the LEA expects to achieve the goal.

**Type of Goal**  
Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Focus Goal.

**State Priorities addressed by this goal.**  
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

**An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.**  
Explain why the LEA has chosen to prioritize this goal.
- An explanation must be based on Dashboard data or other locally collected data.
- LEAs must describe how the LEA identified this goal for focused attention, including relevant consultation with educational partners.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 75 of 97
<!-- Page 584 -->
- LEAs are encouraged to promote transparency and understanding around the decision to pursue a focus goal.

## Required Focus Goal(s) for LEAs Receiving Equity Multiplier Funding

### Description
LEAs receiving Equity Multiplier funding must include one or more focus goals for each school generating Equity Multiplier funding. In addition to addressing the focus goal requirements described above, LEAs must adhere to the following requirements.

Focus goals for Equity Multiplier schoolsites must address the following:

(A) All student groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the Dashboard, and  
(B) Any underlying issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators, if applicable.

- Focus Goals for each and every Equity Multiplier schoolsite must identify specific metrics for each identified student group, as applicable.

- An LEA may create a single goal for multiple Equity Multiplier schoolsites if those schoolsites have the same student group(s) performing at the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators on the Dashboard or experience similar issues in the credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.

  - When creating a single goal for multiple Equity Multiplier schoolsites, the goal must identify the student groups and the performance levels on the Dashboard that the Focus Goal is addressing; or,  
  - The common issues the schoolsites are experiencing in credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators, if applicable.

### Type of Goal
Identify the type of goal being implemented as an Equity Multiplier Focus Goal.

### State Priorities addressed by this goal.
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

### An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.
Explain why the LEA has chosen to prioritize this goal.

- An explanation must be based on Dashboard data or other locally collected data.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 76 of 97
<!-- Page 585 -->
- LEAs must describe how the LEA identified this goal for focused attention, including relevant consultation with educational partners.

- LEAs are encouraged to promote transparency and understanding around the decision to pursue a focus goal.

- In addition to this information, the LEA must also identify:
  - The school or schools to which the goal applies

LEAs are encouraged to approach an Equity Multiplier goal from a wholistic standpoint, considering how the goal might maximize student outcomes through the use of LCFF and other funding in addition to Equity Multiplier funds.

- Equity Multiplier funds must be used to supplement, not supplant, funding provided to Equity Multiplier schoolsites for purposes of the LCFF, the Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (ELO-P), the Literacy Coaches and Reading Specialists (LCRS) Grant Program, and/or the California Community Schools Partnership (CCSPP).

- This means that Equity Multiplier funds must not be used to replace funding that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement LEA-wide actions identified in the LCAP or that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement provisions of the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP.

Note: EC Section 42238.024(b)(1) (California Legislative Information) requires that Equity Multiplier funds be used for the provision of evidence-based services and supports for students. Evidence-based services and supports are based on objective evidence that has informed the design of the service or support and/or guides the modification of those services and supports. Evidence-based supports and strategies are most commonly based on educational research and/or metrics of LEA, school, and/or student performance.

**Broad Goal**

**Description**

Describe what the LEA plans to achieve through the actions included in the goal.

- The description of a broad goal will be clearly aligned with the expected measurable outcomes included for the goal.

- The goal description organizes the actions and expected outcomes in a cohesive and consistent manner.

- A goal description is specific enough to be measurable in either quantitative or qualitative terms. A broad goal is not as specific as a focus goal. While it is specific enough to be measurable, there are many different metrics for measuring progress toward the goal.

**Type of Goal**

Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Broad Goal.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 77 of 97
<!-- Page 586 -->
![Page 78 of 97](https://example.com/image.png)

State Priorities addressed by this goal.  
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.  
Explain why the LEA developed this goal and how the actions and metrics grouped together will help achieve the goal.

**Maintenance of Progress Goal**  
**Description**  
Describe how the LEA intends to maintain the progress made in the LCFF State Priorities not addressed by the other goals in the LCAP.

- Use this type of goal to address the state priorities and applicable metrics not addressed within the other goals in the LCAP.
- The state priorities and metrics to be addressed in this section are those for which the LEA, in consultation with educational partners, has determined to maintain actions and monitor progress while focusing implementation efforts on the actions covered by other goals in the LCAP.

**Type of Goal**  
Identify the type of goal being implemented as a Maintenance of Progress Goal.

State Priorities addressed by this goal.  
Identify each of the state priorities that this goal is intended to address.

An explanation of why the LEA has developed this goal.  
Explain how the actions will sustain the progress exemplified by the related metrics.

**Measuring and Reporting Results:**  
For each LCAP year, identify the metric(s) that the LEA will use to track progress toward the expected outcomes.

- LEAs must identify metrics for specific student groups, as appropriate, including expected outcomes that address and reduce disparities in outcomes between student groups.
- The metrics may be quantitative or qualitative; but at minimum, an LEA’s LCAP must include goals that are measured using all of the applicable metrics for the related state priorities, in each LCAP year, as applicable to the type of LEA.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 78 of 97
<!-- Page 587 -->
- To the extent a state priority does not specify one or more metrics (e.g., implementation of state academic content and performance standards), the LEA must identify a metric to use within the LCAP. For these state priorities, LEAs are encouraged to use metrics based on or reported through the relevant local indicator self-reflection tools within the Dashboard.

- Required metrics for LEA-wide actions: For each action identified as 1) contributing towards the requirement to increase or improve services for foster youth, English learners, including long-term English learners, and low-income students and 2) being provided on an LEA-wide basis, the LEA must identify one or more metrics to monitor the effectiveness of the action and its budgeted expenditures.
  - These required metrics may be identified within the action description or the first prompt in the increased or improved services section, however the description must clearly identify the metric(s) being used to monitor the effectiveness of the action and the action(s) that the metric(s) apply to.

- Required metrics for Equity Multiplier goals: For each Equity Multiplier goal, the LEA must identify:
  - The specific metrics for each identified student group at each specific schoolsite, as applicable, to measure the progress toward the goal, and/or
  - The specific metrics used to measure progress in meeting the goal related to credentialing, subject matter preparation, or educator retention at each specific schoolsite.

Complete the table as follows:

Metric #
- Enter the metric number.

Metric
- Identify the standard of measure being used to determine progress towards the goal and/or to measure the effectiveness of one or more actions associated with the goal.

Baseline
- Enter the baseline when completing the LCAP for 2024–25.
  - Use the most recent data associated with the metric available at the time of adoption of the LCAP for the first year of the three-year plan. LEAs may use data as reported on the 2023 Dashboard for the baseline of a metric only if that data represents the most recent available data (e.g., high school graduation rate). 

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School  
Page 79 of 97
<!-- Page 588 -->
- Using the most recent data available may involve reviewing data the LEA is preparing for submission to the California Longitudinal Pupil Achievement Data System (CALPADS) or data that the LEA has recently submitted to CALPADS.

- Indicate the school year to which the baseline data applies.

- The baseline data must remain unchanged throughout the three-year LCAP.
  - This requirement is not intended to prevent LEAs from revising the baseline data if it is necessary to do so. For example, if an LEA identifies that its data collection practices for a particular metric are leading to inaccurate data and revises its practice to obtain accurate data, it would also be appropriate for the LEA to revise the baseline data to align with the more accurate data process and report its results using the accurate data.
  - If an LEA chooses to revise its baseline data, then, at a minimum, it must clearly identify the change as part of its response to the description of changes prompt in the Goal Analysis for the goal. LEAs are also strongly encouraged to involve their educational partners in the decision of whether or not to revise a baseline and to communicate the proposed change to their educational partners.

- Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one- or two-year LCAP may identify a new baseline each year, as applicable.

### Year 1 Outcome
- When completing the LCAP for 2025–26, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies.
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one-year LCAP may provide the Year 1 Outcome when completing the LCAP for both 2025–26 and 2026–27 or may provide the Year 1 Outcome for 2025–26 and provide the Year 2 Outcome for 2026–27.

### Year 2 Outcome
- When completing the LCAP for 2026–27, enter the most recent data available. Indicate the school year to which the data applies.
  - Note for Charter Schools: Charter schools developing a one-year LCAP may identify the Year 2 Outcome as not applicable when completing the LCAP for 2026–27 or may provide the Year 2 Outcome for 2026–27.

### Target for Year 3 Outcome
- When completing the first year of the LCAP, enter the target outcome for the relevant metric the LEA expects to achieve by the end of the three-year LCAP cycle.

- Include a discussion of relevant challenges and successes experienced with the implementation process.
  
- This discussion must include any instance where the LEA did not implement a planned action or implemented a planned action in a manner that differs substantively from how it was described in the adopted LCAP.

### An explanation of material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and/or Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services.
- Explain material differences between Budgeted Expenditures and Estimated Actual Expenditures and between the Planned Percentages of Improved Services and Estimated Actual Percentages of Improved Services, as applicable. Minor variances in expenditures or percentages do not need to be addressed, and a dollar-for-dollar accounting is not required.

### A description of the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions to date in making progress toward the goal.
- Describe the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the specific actions to date in making progress toward the goal. “Effectiveness” means the degree to which the actions were successful in producing the target result and “ineffectiveness” means that the actions did not produce any significant or targeted result.
  
  - In some cases, not all actions in a goal will be intended to improve performance on all of the metrics associated with the goal.
  
  - When responding to this prompt, LEAs may assess the effectiveness of a single action or group of actions within the goal in the context of performance on a single metric or group of specific metrics within the goal that are applicable to the action(s). Grouping actions with metrics will allow for more robust analysis of whether the strategy the LEA is using to impact a specified set of metrics is working and increase transparency for educational partners. LEAs are encouraged to use such an approach when goals include multiple actions and metrics that are not closely associated.
  
  - Beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period.

### A description of any changes made to the planned goal, metrics, target outcomes, or actions for the coming year that resulted from reflections on prior practice.
- Describe any changes made to this goal, expected outcomes, metrics, or actions to achieve this goal as a result of this analysis and analysis of the data provided in the Dashboard or other local data, as applicable.
  
  - As noted above, beginning with the development of the 2024–25 LCAP, the LEA must change actions that have not proven effective over a three-year period. For actions that have been identified as ineffective, the LEA must identify the ineffective action and must include a description of the following:
  
    - The reasons for the ineffectiveness, and
  
    - How changes to the action will result in a new or strengthened approach.

![Actions for Foster Youth](https://example.com/image.png)

**Actions for Foster Youth:** School districts, COEs, and charter schools that have a numerically significant foster youth student subgroup are encouraged to include specific actions in the LCAP designed to meet needs specific to foster youth students.

### Required Actions
- LEAs with 30 or more English learners and/or 15 or more long-term English learners must include specific actions in the LCAP related to, at a minimum:
  - Language acquisition programs, as defined in EC Section 306, provided to students, and
  - Professional development for teachers.
  - If an LEA has both 30 or more English learners and 15 or more long-term English learners, the LEA must include actions for both English learners and long-term English learners.

- LEAs eligible for technical assistance pursuant to EC sections 47607.3, 52071, 52071.5, 52072, or 52072.5, must include specific actions within the LCAP related to its implementation of the work underway as part of technical assistance. The most common form of this technical assistance is frequently referred to as Differentiated Assistance.

- LEAs that have Red Dashboard indicators for (1) a school within the LEA, (2) a student group within the LEA, and/or (3) a student group within any school within the LEA must include one or more specific actions within the LCAP:
  - The specific action(s) must be directed towards the identified student group(s) and/or school(s) and must address the identified state indicator(s) for which the student group or school received the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard. Each student group and/or school that receives the lowest performance level on the 2023 Dashboard must be addressed by one or more actions.
  - These required actions will be effective for the three-year LCAP cycle.

### Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students

**Purpose**  
A well-written Increased or Improved Services section provides educational partners with a comprehensive description, within a single dedicated section, of how an LEA plans to increase or improve services for its unduplicated students as defined in EC Section 42238.02 in grades TK–12 as compared to all students in grades TK–12, as applicable, and how LEA-wide or schoolwide actions identified for this purpose meet regulatory requirements. Descriptions provided should include sufficient detail yet be sufficiently succinct to promote a broader understanding.
<!-- Page 593 -->
![Page 85 of 97](https://example.com/image-url)

understanding of educational partners to facilitate their ability to provide input. An LEA’s description in this section must align with the actions included in the Goals and Actions section as contributing.

Please Note: For the purpose of meeting the Increased or Improved Services requirement and consistent with EC Section 42238.02, long-term English learners are included in the English learner student group.

**Statutory Requirements**  
An LEA is required to demonstrate in its LCAP how it is increasing or improving services for its students who are foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income, collectively referred to as unduplicated students, as compared to the services provided to all students in proportion to the increase in funding it receives based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the LEA (EC Section 42238.07[a][1], EC Section 52064[b][8][B]; 5 CCR Section 15496[a]). This proportionality percentage is also known as the “minimum proportionality percentage” or “MPP.” The manner in which an LEA demonstrates it is meeting its MPP is two-fold: (1) through the expenditure of LCFF funds or through the identification of a Planned Percentage of Improved Services as documented in the Contributing Actions Table, and (2) through the explanations provided in the Increased or Improved Services for Foster Youth, English Learners, and Low-Income Students section.

To improve services means to grow services in quality and to increase services means to grow services in quantity. Services are increased or improved by those actions in the LCAP that are identified in the Goals and Actions section as contributing to the increased or improved services requirement, whether they are provided across the entire LEA (LEA-wide action), provided to an entire school (Schoolwide action), or solely provided to one or more unduplicated student group(s) (Limited action).

Therefore, for any action contributing to meet the increased or improved services requirement, the LEA must include an explanation of:

- How the action is increasing or improving services for the unduplicated student group(s) (Identified Needs and Action Design), and
- How the action meets the LEA's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state and any local priority areas (Measurement of Effectiveness).

**LEA-wide and Schoolwide Actions**  
In addition to the above required explanations, LEAs must provide a justification for why an LEA-wide or Schoolwide action is being provided to all students and how the action is intended to improve outcomes for unduplicated student group(s) as compared to all students.

- Conclusory statements that a service will help achieve an expected outcome for the goal, without an explicit connection or further explanation as to how, are not sufficient.
- Further, simply stating that an LEA has a high enrollment percentage of a specific student group or groups does not meet the increased or improved services standard because enrolling students is not the same as serving students.

**For School Districts Only**  
Actions provided on an LEA-wide basis at school districts with an unduplicated pupil percentage of less than 55 percent must also include a description of how the actions are the most effective use of the funds to meet the district's goals for its unduplicated pupils in the state.

Total Projected LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants
- Specify the amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grant funds the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year based on the number and concentration of foster youth, English learner, and low-income students. This amount includes the Additional 15 percent LCFF Concentration Grant.

Projected Additional 15 percent LCFF Concentration Grant
- Specify the amount of additional LCFF concentration grant add-on funding, as described in EC Section 42238.02, that the LEA estimates it will receive in the coming year.

Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year
- Specify the estimated percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

LCFF Carryover — Percentage
- Specify the LCFF Carryover — Percentage identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover percentage is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify a percentage of zero (0.00%).

LCFF Carryover — Dollar
- Specify the LCFF Carryover — Dollar amount identified in the LCFF Carryover Table. If a carryover amount is not identified in the LCFF Carryover Table, specify an amount of zero ($0).

Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year
<!-- Page 595 -->
- Add the Projected Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Coming School Year and the Proportional LCFF Required Carryover Percentage and specify the percentage. This is the LEA’s percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the LCAP year, as calculated pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(7).

**Required Descriptions: LEA-wide and Schoolwide Actions**  
For each action being provided to an entire LEA or school, provide an explanation of (1) the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed, (2) how the action is designed to address the identified need(s) and why it is being provided on an LEA or schoolwide basis, and (3) the metric(s) used to measure the effectiveness of the action in improving outcomes for the unduplicated student group(s).

If the LEA has provided this required description in the Action Descriptions, state as such within the table.

Complete the table as follows:

**Identified Need(s)**  
Provide an explanation of the unique identified need(s) of the LEA’s unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed.

An LEA demonstrates how an action is principally directed towards an unduplicated student group(s) when the LEA explains the need(s), condition(s), or circumstance(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) identified through a needs assessment and how the action addresses them. A meaningful needs assessment includes, at a minimum, analysis of applicable student achievement data and educational partner feedback.

**How the Action(s) are Designed to Address Need(s) and Why it is Provided on an LEA-wide or Schoolwide Basis**  
Provide an explanation of how the action as designed will address the unique identified need(s) of the LEA’s unduplicated student group(s) for whom the action is principally directed and the rationale for why the action is being provided on an LEA-wide or schoolwide basis.

- As stated above, conclusory statements that a service will help achieve an expected outcome for the goal, without an explicit connection or further explanation as to how, are not sufficient.
  
- Further, simply stating that an LEA has a high enrollment percentage of a specific student group or groups does not meet the increased or improved services standard because enrolling students is not the same as serving students.

**Metric(s) to Monitor Effectiveness**  
Identify the metric(s) being used to measure the progress and effectiveness of the action(s).

<!-- Page 596 -->
![Note for COEs and Charter Schools: In the case of COEs and charter schools, schoolwide and LEA-wide are considered to be synonymous.](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

## Limited Actions
For each action being solely provided to one or more unduplicated student group(s), provide an explanation of (1) the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served, (2) how the action is designed to address the identified need(s), and (3) how the effectiveness of the action in improving outcomes for the unduplicated student group(s) will be measured.

If the LEA has provided the required descriptions in the Action Descriptions, state as such.

### Complete the table as follows:

**Identified Need(s)**  
Provide an explanation of the unique need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served identified through the LEA’s needs assessment. A meaningful needs assessment includes, at a minimum, analysis of applicable student achievement data and educational partner feedback.

**How the Action(s) are Designed to Address Need(s)**  
Provide an explanation of how the action is designed to address the unique identified need(s) of the unduplicated student group(s) being served.

**Metric(s) to Monitor Effectiveness**  
Identify the metric(s) being used to measure the progress and effectiveness of the action(s).

For any limited action contributing to meeting the increased or improved services requirement that is associated with a Planned Percentage of Improved Services in the Contributing Summary Table rather than an expenditure of LCFF funds, describe the methodology that was used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage, as applicable.

- For each action with an identified Planned Percentage of Improved Services, identify the goal and action number and describe the methodology that was used.

- When identifying a Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA must describe the methodology that it used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. The percentage of improved services for an action corresponds to the amount of LCFF funding that the LEA estimates it would expend to implement the action if it were funded.

- For example, an LEA determines that there is a need to analyze data to ensure that instructional aides and expanded learning providers know what targeted supports to provide to students who are foster youth. The LEA could implement this action by hiring additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students, which, based on the LEA’s current pay scale, the LEA estimates would cost $165,000. Instead, the LEA chooses to utilize a portion of existing staff time to analyze data relating to students who are.

foster youth. This analysis will then be shared with site principals who will use the data to coordinate services provided by instructional assistants and expanded learning providers to target support to students. In this example, the LEA would divide the estimated cost of $165,000 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Total Planned Expenditures Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Planned Percentage of Improvement Services for the action.

## Additional Concentration Grant Funding
A description of the plan for how the additional concentration grant add-on funding identified above will be used to increase the number of staff providing direct services to students at schools that have a high concentration (above 55 percent) of foster youth, English learners, and low-income students, as applicable.

An LEA that receives the additional concentration grant add-on described in EC Section 42238.02 is required to demonstrate how it is using these funds to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent as compared to the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is equal to or less than 55 percent. The staff who provide direct services to students must be certificated staff and/or classified staff employed by the LEA; classified staff includes custodial staff.

Provide the following descriptions, as applicable to the LEA:

- An LEA that does not receive a concentration grant or the concentration grant add-on must indicate that a response to this prompt is not applicable.
  
- Identify the goal and action numbers of the actions in the LCAP that the LEA is implementing to meet the requirement to increase the number of staff who provide direct services to students at schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

- An LEA that does not have comparison schools from which to describe how it is using the concentration grant add-on funds, such as a single-school LEA or an LEA that only has schools with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, must describe how it is using the funds to increase the number of credentialed staff, classified staff, or both, including custodial staff, who provide direct services to students at selected schools and the criteria used to determine which schools require additional staffing support.

- In the event that an additional concentration grant add-on is not sufficient to increase staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, the LEA must describe how it is using the funds to retain staff providing direct services to students at a school with an enrollment of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent.

Complete the table as follows:

- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of classified staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA.

2024-25 Local Control and Accountability Plan for San Juan Choices Charter School

<!-- Page 598 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

- The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA.
- The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.
- Provide the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is 55 percent or less and the staff-to-student ratio of certificated staff providing direct services to students at schools with a concentration of unduplicated students that is greater than 55 percent, as applicable to the LEA.
- The LEA may group its schools by grade span (Elementary, Middle/Junior High, and High Schools), as applicable to the LEA.
- The staff-to-student ratio must be based on the number of FTE staff and the number of enrolled students as counted on the first Wednesday in October of each year.

## Action Tables
Complete the Total Planned Expenditures Table for each action in the LCAP. The information entered into this table will automatically populate the other Action Tables. Information is only entered into the Total Planned Expenditures Table, the Annual Update Table, the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, and the LCFF Carryover Table. The word "input" has been added to column headers to aid in identifying the column(s) where information will be entered. Information is not entered on the remaining Action tables.

The following tables are required to be included as part of the LCAP adopted by the local governing board or governing body:

- If “Yes” is entered into the Contributing column, then complete the following columns:
  
  - **Scope**: The scope of an action may be LEA-wide (i.e., districtwide, countywide, or charterwide), schoolwide, or limited. An action that is LEA-wide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of the LEA. An action that is schoolwide in scope upgrades the entire educational program of a single school. An action that is limited in its scope is an action that serves only one or more unduplicated student groups.
  
  - **Unduplicated Student Group(s)**: Regardless of scope, contributing actions serve one or more unduplicated student groups. Indicate one or more unduplicated student groups for whom services are being increased or improved as compared to what all students receive.
  
  - **Location**: Identify the location where the action will be provided. If the action is provided to all schools within the LEA, the LEA must indicate “All Schools.” If the action is provided to specific schools within the LEA or specific grade spans only, the LEA must enter “Specific Schools” or “Specific Grade Spans.” Identify the individual school or a subset of schools or grade spans (e.g., all high schools or grades transitional kindergarten through grade five), as appropriate.

- **Time Span**: Enter “ongoing” if the action will be implemented for an indeterminate period of time. Otherwise, indicate the span of time for which the action will be implemented. For example, an LEA might enter “1 Year,” or “2 Years,” or “6 Months.”

- **Total Personnel**: Enter the total amount of personnel expenditures utilized to implement this action.

- **Total Non-Personnel**: This amount will be automatically calculated based on information provided in the Total Personnel column and the Total Funds column.

- **LCFF Funds**: Enter the total amount of LCFF funds utilized to implement this action, if any. LCFF funds include all funds that make up an LEA’s total LCFF target (i.e., base grant, grade span adjustment, supplemental grant, concentration grant, Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant, and Home-To-School Transportation).
  
  - **Note**: For an action to contribute towards meeting the increased or improved services requirement, it must include some measure of LCFF funding. The action may also include funding from other sources, however the extent to which an action contributes to meeting the increased or improved services requirement is based on the LCFF funding being used to implement the action.

- **Other State Funds**: Enter the total amount of Other State Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.
  
  - **Note**: Equity Multiplier funds must be included in the “Other State Funds” category, not in the “LCFF Funds” category. As a reminder, Equity Multiplier funds must be used to supplement, not supplant, funding provided to Equity Multiplier schoolsites for purposes of the LCFF, the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP. This means that Equity Multiplier funds must not be used to replace funding that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement LEA-wide actions identified in the LEA’s LCAP or that an Equity Multiplier schoolsite would otherwise receive to implement provisions of the ELO-P, the LCRS, and/or the CCSPP.

- **Local Funds:** Enter the total amount of Local Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.
- **Federal Funds:** Enter the total amount of Federal Funds utilized to implement this action, if any.
- **Total Funds:** This amount is automatically calculated based on amounts entered in the previous four columns.
- **Planned Percentage of Improved Services:** For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the planned quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%). A limited action is an action that only serves foster youth, English learners, and/or low-income students.

  - o As noted in the instructions for the Increased or Improved Services section, when identifying a Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA must describe the methodology that is used to determine the contribution of the action towards the proportional percentage. The percentage of improved services for an action corresponds to the amount of LCFF funding that the LEA estimates it would expend to implement the action if it were funded.

  For example, an LEA determines that there is a need to analyze data to ensure that instructional aides and expanded learning providers know what targeted supports to provide to students who are foster youth. The LEA could implement this action by hiring additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students, which, based on the LEA’s current pay scale, the LEA estimates would cost $165,000. Instead, the LEA chooses to utilize a portion of existing staff time to analyze data relating to students who are foster youth. This analysis will then be shared with site principals who will use the data to coordinate services provided by instructional assistants and expanded learning providers to target support to students. In this example, the LEA would divide the estimated cost of $165,000 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Planned Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

**Contributing Actions Table**  
As noted above, information will not be entered in the Contributing Actions Table; however, the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column will need to be checked to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses.

**Annual Update Table**  
In the Annual Update Table, provide the following information for each action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:
- **Estimated Actual Expenditures:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditures to implement this action, if any.
<!-- Page 602 -->
# Contributing Actions Annual Update Table

In the Contributing Actions Annual Update Table, check the ‘Contributing to Increased or Improved Services?’ column to ensure that only actions with a “Yes” are displaying. If actions with a “No” are displayed or if actions that are contributing are not displaying in the column, use the drop-down menu in the column header to filter only the “Yes” responses. Provide the following information for each contributing action in the LCAP for the relevant LCAP year:

- **6. Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants:** Provide the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants estimated based on the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the current school year.

- **Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions:** Enter the total estimated actual expenditure of LCFF funds used to implement this action, if any.

- **Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services:** For any action identified as contributing, being provided on a Limited basis only to unduplicated students, and that does not have funding associated with the action, enter the total estimated actual quality improvement anticipated for the action as a percentage rounded to the nearest hundredth (0.00%).

  - Building on the example provided above for calculating the Planned Percentage of Improved Services, the LEA in the example implements the action. As part of the annual update process, the LEA reviews implementation and student outcome data and determines that the action was implemented with fidelity and that outcomes for foster youth students improved. The LEA reviews the original estimated cost for the action and determines that had it hired additional staff to collect and analyze data and to coordinate supports for students that estimated actual cost would have been $169,500 due to a cost of living adjustment. The LEA would divide the estimated actual cost of $169,500 by the amount of LCFF Funding identified in the Data Entry Table and then convert the quotient to a percentage. This percentage is the Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services for the action.

# LCFF Carryover Table

- **9. Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant:** Provide the total amount of estimated LCFF Target Entitlement for the current school year, excluding the supplemental and concentration grants and the add-ons for the Targeted Instructional Improvement Block Grant program, the former Home-to-School Transportation program, and the Small School District Transportation program, pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8). Note that the LCFF Base Grant for purposes of the LCAP also includes the Necessary Small Schools and Economic Recovery Target allowances for school districts, and County Operations Grant for COEs. See EC sections 2574 (for COEs) and 42238.02 (for school districts and charter schools), as applicable, for LCFF entitlement calculations.

- **10. Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Current School Year:** This percentage will not be entered. The percentage is calculated based on the amounts of the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9) and the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants (6), pursuant to 5 CCR Section 15496(a)(8), plus the LCFF Carryover – Percentage from the prior year. This is the percentage by which services for unduplicated pupils must be increased or improved as compared to the services provided to all students in the current LCAP year.

# Calculations in the Action Tables

To reduce the duplication of effort of LEAs, the Action Tables include functionality such as pre-population of fields and cells based on the information provided in the Data Entry Table, the Annual Update Summary Table, and the Contributing Actions Table. For transparency, the functionality and calculations used are provided below.

## Contributing Actions Table

- **4. Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (LCFF Funds)**
  - This amount is the total of the Planned Expenditures for Contributing Actions (LCFF Funds) column.

- **5. Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services**
  - This percentage is the total of the Planned Percentage of Improved Services column.

- **Planned Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the coming school year (4 divided by 1, plus 5)**
  - This percentage is calculated by dividing the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) by the Projected LCFF Base Grant (1), converting the quotient to a percentage, and adding it to the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5).

## Contributing Actions Annual Update Table

Pursuant to EC Section 42238.07(c)(2), if the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) is less than the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants (6), the LEA is required to calculate the difference between the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5) and the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (7). If the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4) is equal to or greater than the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants (6), the Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services will display “Not Required.”

- **6. Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and Concentration Grants**
  - This is the total amount of LCFF supplemental and concentration grants the LEA estimates it will actually receive based on of the number and concentration of unduplicated students in the current school year.

- **4. Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (LCFF Funds)**
  - This amount is the total of the Last Year's Planned Expenditures for Contributing Actions (LCFF Funds).

- **7. Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions**
  - This amount is the total of the Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (LCFF Funds).
<!-- Page 604 -->
- **Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (Subtract 7 from 4)**
  - This amount is the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (7) subtracted from the Total Planned Contributing Expenditures (4).

- **5. Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (%)**
  - This amount is the total of the Planned Percentage of Improved Services column.

- **8. Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (%)**
  - This amount is the total of the Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services column.

- **Difference Between Planned and Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (Subtract 5 from 8)**
  - This amount is the Total Planned Percentage of Improved Services (5) subtracted from the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (8).

**LCFF Carryover Table**

- **10. Total Percentage to Increase or Improve Services for the Current School Year (6 divided by 9 plus Carryover %)**
  - This percentage is the Estimated Actual LCFF Supplemental and/or Concentration Grants (6) divided by the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9) plus the LCFF Carryover – Percentage from the prior year.

- **11. Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (7 divided by 9, plus 8)**
  - This percentage is the Total Estimated Actual Expenditures for Contributing Actions (7) divided by the LCFF Funding (9), then converting the quotient to a percentage and adding the Total Estimated Actual Percentage of Improved Services (8).

- **12. LCFF Carryover — Dollar Amount LCFF Carryover (Subtract 11 from 10 and multiply by 9)**
  - If the Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (11) is less than the Estimated Actual Percentage to Increase or Improve Services (10), the LEA is required to carry over LCFF funds.
  
  The amount of LCFF funds is calculated by subtracting the Estimated Actual Percentage to Increase or Improve Services (11) from the Estimated Actual Percentage of Increased or Improved Services (10) and then multiplying by the Estimated Actual LCFF Base Grant (9). This amount is the amount of LCFF funds that is required to be carried over to the coming year.

- **13. LCFF Carryover — Percentage (12 divided by 9)**
<!-- Page 605 -->
- This percentage is the unmet portion of the Percentage to Increase or Improve Services that the LEA must carry over into the coming LCAP year. The percentage is calculated by dividing the LCFF Carryover (12) by the LCFF Funding (9).

**Superintendent’s Message**

Aligning our resources to be most effective for our highest priorities is key to providing successful outcomes for our students. Last school year, our district engaged in a strategic planning process by collecting input and feedback from a variety of educational partners including students, families, community members and staff. Their voices informed the development of our new strategic plan.

The new plan calls out our daily mission, to partner with our community in setting high expectations for academic achievement rooted in equity and unity to create supportive learning experiences in which students, families and staff can excel and thrive. To do this, our investments over the next several years will be aligned with the plan’s four strategic directions:

I. Advance and Support Student Success  
II. Prioritize Equitable Practices  
III. Enhance Employee Systems and Supports  
IV. Engage Students, Families and Community as Valued Educational Partners  

Each of these four areas identifies outcomes we must achieve to be successful and recognizes that we as a community must all be a part of educating our youth. Each year the budgeting process helps us identify where we will apply our resources and as we move forward, that work will be led by this strategic plan. Please take a moment to review the plan at [www.sanjuan.edu/strategicplan](http://www.sanjuan.edu/strategicplan).

I deeply appreciate the ongoing support of our students and schools from the San Juan Unified community and look forward to the year ahead.

In community,

Melissa Bassanelli  
Superintendent of Schools

# OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTION

## FINANCIAL OVERVIEW

The San Juan Unified School District financial status is comprised of three major components: (1) Fund Balance (Ending and Beginning Balance); (2) Revenues; and (3) Expenditures. This document reflects audited figures for 2022-23, estimated actuals for 2023-24, adopted budget for 2024-25 and multi-year projections for 2025-26 and 2026-27.

## DISTRICT MISSION

We partner with our San Juan Unified community in setting high expectations for academic achievement rooted in equity and unity to create supportive learning experiences in which all students, families and staff can excel and thrive.

## SHARED VALUES

We value:

- **Belonging**  
  We create a community that cultivates welcoming and inclusive environments with genuine respect for our diversity of cultures, identities and abilities.

- **Relevance**  
  We design experiences and environments where each learner can explore and apply skills and knowledge that align with evolving careers and workplaces.

- **Voice**  
  We honor and affirm all voices of our school community and encourage them to share their perspectives to help improve and shape what we do and how we do it.

- **Social and Emotional Intelligence**  
  We build a culture that teaches, models and applies social and emotional intelligence in all interactions with each other.

- **Resilience**  
  We create nurturing schools and programs that inspire each learner to continue to persevere, gain strength and develop the confidence to excel beyond challenges.

- **Championing**  
  We support and advocate for those in our San Juan Unified community who are disproportionately impacted or marginalized by circumstances beyond their control.

- **Innovation**  
  We embrace and encourage creative thinking and learning environments that transform ideas into actionable solutions.
<!-- Page 615 -->
# CORE COMMITMENTS
- Prioritize resources to close opportunity gaps, improve teaching and learning, recruit and retain high quality employees and help all students reach their potential.
- Provide sound fiscal stewardship of community resources.
- Build trust by sharing useful, transparent fiscal information.
- Adopt a budget that consistently balances ongoing revenues and expenditures to avoid a structural deficit.

# CORE MESSAGES
- Governor Newsom released his revised 2024-25 budget on May 10, 2024. It reflects a current-year shortfall of $27.6 billion and a shortfall of $28.4 billion deficit for next year.
- The proposal includes a 1.07% COLA to the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) and is applied to categorical programs such as special education and school nutrition.
- Outside education, the Governor proposes significant spending cuts to government operations, reductions to programs, and pauses of new investments. Thankfully, K-14 education continues to be shielded from ongoing programmatic reductions.
- The Governor proposes to fully deplete the Proposition 98 Rainy Day Fund.
- The risks to the state’s budget include inflation, the highest unemployment rate in the nation, slow economic growth, high interest rates, and geopolitical factors.
- The district will continue to exercise caution and flexibility in long-term fiscal planning.
- Preserve an ending fund balance that ensures the integrity and stability of the district.

# SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION (SCOE)
The Sacramento County Office of Education (SCOE) reviews all district budgets and interim budget reports. SCOE has an oversight obligation to monitor the district’s long-term fiscal health as prescribed in AB 1200. SCOE has provided the following guidance:
- Re-evaluate spending priorities to address student achievement and begin new initiatives only if long-term solvency can be maintained (avoid cycles of additions and reductions).
- Strategically invest stimulus funds to help students recover learning loss, provide wrap-around supports, and reduce future operational costs.
- Exercise caution and maintain flexibility in the collective bargaining process. Neighboring districts have widely divergent funding levels.
- Maintain reserves greater than the minimum requirement.
- Support ongoing expenditures with ongoing revenues.

# PROPOSITION 55 AND THE EDUCATION PROTECTION ACT (EPA)
Proposition 55 was passed by voters in November 2016. It extends the temporary personal income tax increase first enacted by Proposition 30. While the higher tax rates for high-income earners will be extended for an additional 12 years (through 2030), the sales tax increase expired at the end of 2016.
<!-- Page 616 -->
# STATE FUNDING AND AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE

California funds schools based on student attendance, also known as Average Daily Attendance (ADA). A student attending every day would equal one ADA. ADA is not the same as enrollment, which is the number of students officially enrolled in district schools. Average Daily Attendance is used to calculate a district’s proportionate share of state revenue from resources such as; the Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF), Special Education, and Lottery funds.

## San Juan Unified School District Funded ADA

| Year               | Funded ADA   |
|--------------------|--------------|
| 2022-23 Actual     | 36,931.83    |
| 2023-24 Actual     | 35,815.33    |
| 2024-25 Projected  | 35,891.28    |
| 2025-26 Projected  | 36,891.28    |
| 2026-27 Projected  | 35,891.28    |

## 2024-25 LCFF Funding Factors

Students are funded based on grade spans. Students in grades K-3 receive an adjustment for smaller class sizes as well as TK students commencing in 2022/23. Students in grades 9-12 receive an adjustment for Career Technical Education (CTE).

| Grade Span | 2024-25 Base Grant Per ADA | Grade Span Adjustment | 2024-25 Total Base Grant Per ADA |
|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| TK-3      | $10,025                     | $1,043                | $11,068                           |
| 4-6       | $10,177                     | -                     | $10,177                           |
| 7-8       | $10,478                     | -                     | $10,478                           |
| 9-12      | $12,144                     | $316                  | $12,460                           |

![Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)](https://example.com/image.jpg)

# Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF)
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) is a California law passed in 2013 that changed the method of distributing funds from the state to local school districts. LCFF funds include a base level grant for all Local Education Agencies (LEA) based on Average Daily Attendance. Additional funding is provided through supplemental and concentration grants based on the unduplicated number of high need students in the following categories: English learner, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and foster youth.

## Eight Areas of State Priority
The Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) also lists eight state priority areas that every district must address in their Local Control Accountability Plan (LCAP) to ensure a high-quality educational program for students focused on conditions for learning, engagement, and pupil outcomes:
- **Conditions for Learning:** Basic services, implementation of state standards, course access
- **Engagement:** Parent engagement, pupil engagement, school climate
- **Pupil Outcomes:** Pupil achievement, other pupil outcomes

## Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP)
In order to access the funds from the State of California, LEAs develop a Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP). The LCAP is a three-year plan that is revised annually, addresses the Eight State Priorities, includes the perspectives and ideas of our educational partners, and describes how services are provided to improve student performance with an emphasis on English learner, low income, and foster youth students.

## LCAP Goals
The 2022-27 LCAP is designed around four goals that are aligned to the state priority areas and required LCAP metrics. These goals include:
1. **Student Achievement and Implementation of State Standards** - Improve achievement and outcomes for all students as measured by performance on statewide assessments, English proficiency, and college and career preparedness.
2. **Student Engagement and Course Access** - Provide students with engaging programs, course work, and opportunities that address attendance, dropout, graduation, and access to a broad course of study.
3. **School Conditions, Climate, and Family Engagement** - Address factors both inside and outside the classroom that impact student success such as family engagement, health, safety, discipline, connectedness, facilities, materials, and staffing.
4. **Schools with Non-Stability Rates of +25% and Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Rates of +70%** - Within three years, improve outcomes for student groups that have the lowest performance level on one or more state indicators, and address any underlying issues with credentialing, subject matter preparation, and retention of the school’s educators.

![State and Local Metrics](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=State+and+Local+Metrics)

State and Local Metrics  
California has adopted state and local indicators to measure school district and individual school site performance in each of the state priorities. Performance data on state and local indicators is publicly reported on the California School Dashboard and in the LCAP to provide families and educators with information on school and district progress. State Indicators apply to all districts, schools, and student groups and are based on data that is collected consistently across the state whereas Local Indicators apply to districts and charters and are collected at the district level.

Continuous Improvement  
Each year, the LCAP is updated using a continuous improvement process focused on:  
- Building on the work currently being implemented to maintain continuity of learning  
- Analyzing multiples sources of data that includes educational partner input, state and local data, and research  
- Refining actions based on what is learned in order to improve

# Part I - General Administrative Share of Plant Services Costs
California's indirect cost plan allows that the general administrative costs in the indirect cost pool may include that portion of plant services costs (maintenance and operations costs and facilities rents and leases costs) attributable to the general administrative offices. The calculation of the plant services costs attributed to general administration and included in the pool is standardized and automated using the percentage of salaries and benefits relating to general administration as proxy for the percentage of square footage occupied by general administration.

## A. Salaries and Benefits - Other General Administration and Centralized Data Processing
1. Salaries and benefits paid through payroll (Funds 01, 09, and 62, objects 1000-3999 except 3701-3702)
   (Functions 7200-7700, goals 0000 and 9000)  
   **22,457,405.00**

2. Contracted general administrative positions not paid through payroll  
   a. Enter the costs, if any, of general administrative positions performing services ON SITE but paid through a contract, rather than through payroll, in functions 7200-7700, goals 0000 and 9000, Object $800.  
   **0.00**  
   b. If an amount is entered on Line A2a, provide the title, duties, and approximate FTE of each general administrative position paid through a contract. Retain supporting documentation in case of audit.

## B. Salaries and Benefits - All Other Activities
1. Salaries and benefits paid through payroll (Funds 01, 09, and 62, objects 1000-3999 except 3701-3702)  
   (Functions 7100-6999, 7100-7480, & 8100-8400; Functions 7200-7700, all goals except 0000 & 9000)  
   **524,698,659.00**

## C. Percentage of Plant Services Costs Attributable to General Administration  
(Line A1 plus Line A2a, divided by Line B1; zero if negative) (See Part III, Lines A5 and A6)  
**4.28%**

# Part II - Adjustments for Employment Separation Costs
When an employee separates from service, the local educational agency (LEA) may incur costs associated with the separation in addition to the employee's regular salary and benefits. These additional costs can be categorized as "normal" or "abnormal" or mass* separation costs.

Normal separation costs include items such as pay for accumulated unused leave or routine severance pay authorized by governing board policy. Normal separation costs are not allowable as direct costs to federal programs, but are allowable as indirect costs. State programs may have similar restrictions. Where federal or state program guidelines required that the LEA charge an employee's normal separation costs to an unrestricted resource rather than to the restricted program in which the employee worked, the LEA may identify and enter these costs on Line A for inclusion in the indirect cost pool.

Abnormal or mass separation costs are those costs resulting from actions taken by an LEA to influence employees to terminate their employment earlier than they normally would have. Abnormal or mass separation costs include retirement incentives such as Golden Handshakes or severance packages negotiated to effect termination. Abnormal or mass separation costs may not be charged to federal programs as other direct costs or indirect costs. Where an LEA paid abnormal or mass separation costs on behalf of positions in general administrative functions included in the indirect cost pool, the LEA must identify and enter these costs on Line B for exclusion from the pool.

## A. Normal Separation Costs (optional)  
Enter any normal separation costs paid on behalf of employees of restricted state or federal programs that were charged to an unrestricted resource (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 1000-6999 or 8100-8400 rather than to the restricted program. These costs will be moved in Part III from base costs to the indirect cost pool. Retain supporting documentation.

## B. Abnormal or Mass Separation Costs  
Enter any abnormal or mass separation costs paid on behalf of general administrative positions charged to unrestricted resources (0000-1999) in funds 01, 09, and 62 with functions 7200-7700. These costs will be moved in Part III from the indirect cost pool to base costs. If none, enter zero.

![Education Protection Account (EPA)](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Education+Protection+Account+(EPA))

The Education Protection Account (EPA) provides local educational agencies (LEAs) with general purpose state aid funding pursuant to Proposition 30, the Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act of 2012, approved by the voters on November 6, 2012. Proposition 55 (2016), continues the use of EPA. The EPA funding is a component of an LEA's or Charter School’s total Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) revenue. Proposition 55 takes effect on January 1, 2018, and remains in effect through December 31, 2030.

The revenues generated from Propositions 30 and 55 are deposited into the EPA and a corresponding reduction is made to the district’s or charter school’s LCFF revenue. For 2024-25, the reduction is approximately 24% of the total LCFF funding. The district began receiving EPA payments quarterly in Fiscal Year 2013–14.

### Funding Before Proposition 30
- **Local Taxes:** 29%
- **State Aid:** 71%

### Funding After Proposition 30
- **Local Taxes:** 29%
- **State Aid:** 47%
- **EPA:** 24%

Proposition 30 requires that each LEA shall have sole authority to determine how the moneys received from the Education Protection Account are spent in the school or schools within its jurisdiction, provided, however, that the appropriate governing board or body shall make these spending determinations in open session of a public meeting of the governing board or body and shall not use any of the funds from the Education Protection Account for salaries or benefits of administrators or for any other administrative costs. An LEA may allocate the EPA entitlement entirely to one program for expenditure.

Propositions 30 and 55 require all districts, counties, and charter schools to report on their Web sites an accounting of how much money was received from the EPA and how that money was spent. District EPA information for previous years can be found by selecting the Budget Info link on the District’s website.

Listed on the next page is the Education Protection Account Expenditure plan listing how the moneys received from the Education Protection Account are proposed to be spent in 2024-25.

- The minimum recommended reserve for economic uncertainties;
- The combined assigned and unassigned ending fund balances that are in excess of the minimum recommended reserve for economic uncertainties for each fiscal year identified in the budget; and per Education Code Section 42127(a)(2)(B), a statement of the reasons that substantiate the need for assigned and unassigned ending fund balances in excess of the minimum reserve standard for economic uncertainties.

# GLOSSARY

This glossary provides definitions of current terms used in school business documents.

**Accounts Payable**  
Amounts due and owed to private persons, business firms, governmental units, or others for goods received and/or services rendered prior to the end of the fiscal year. Includes amounts billed but not paid. Does not include amounts due to other funds of the same school district.

**Accounts Receivable**  
Amounts due and owed the district from private persons, business firms, governmental units, or others for goods or services rendered by the district prior to the end of the fiscal year. Includes amounts billed but not received. Does not include amounts due from other funds of the same school district.

**Apportionments**  
State aid given to a school district or county office of education. Apportionments are calculated three times for each school year. The First Principal Apportionment (P-1) is calculated in February of the school year corresponding to the P-1 ADA (See Attendance Reports); the Second Principal Apportionment (P-2) is calculated in June corresponding to the P-2 ADA; and the annual recalculation of the apportionment is made in February following the school year and is based on P-2 ADA, except for programs where the annual count of ADA is used.

**Available Balance**  
Budgeted amount less expenditures to date and encumbrances.

**Average Daily Attendance (ADA)**  
The student days of actual attendance divided by the number of days school was in session. A student attending every day of school would equal one ADA. ADA is usually lower than enrollment due to factors such as students moving, dropping out, or staying home due to illness. The state uses a school district’s ADA to determine its general purpose revenue and other funding.

**Bond Measure**  
Bonds allow school districts to borrow funds to pay for a large capital investment—much as a person borrows to purchase a home. Districts can choose to seek bond passage with either a two-thirds vote or a 55% vote which requires greater accountability measures. The principal and interest are repaid by local property owners through an increase in property taxes. A simple majority of state voters may approve a state general obligation bond, which is repaid by state taxes and has no impact on property tax rates.

**Bonded Indebtedness**  
An obligation incurred by the sale of bonds for acquisition of school facilities or other capital expenditures. Since 1986, districts have been able to levy a local property tax to amortize bonded indebtedness provided the taxes are approved by a two-thirds vote of the electorate.

![SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION AGENDA ITEM](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=SAN+JUAN+UNIFIED+SCHOOL+DISTRICT+BOARD+OF+EDUCATION+AGENDA+ITEM)

**SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT**  
**BOARD OF EDUCATION**  
**AGENDA ITEM**  
**MEETING DATE:** 06/11/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Middle School Boundary Adjustments  
**DEPARTMENT:** Facilities  

**CHECK ONE:**  
For Discussion: ☒  
For Action: ☐  
Report: ☐  
Workshop: ☐  
Recognition: ☐  
Emergency Action: ☐  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The board is asked to consider and discuss the superintendent’s recommendation to adopt proposed boundary map number three to modify middle school attendance boundaries in the western region of the district. This item will be brought back for action on June 25, 2024.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
This item follows up on previous direction from the board that staff examine the possibility of adjusting the attendance boundaries at specific middle school campuses as part of an overall plan to adapt to enrollment growth and maintain long term stability in the district.

District staff, with board direction, convened a committee of district staff members (“Committee”) comprised of principals, facility planners, consultants, and district staff to study the impact of the boundary adjustments as per board policy. The committee also conducted various outreach events to solicit additional feedback from members of the public that may be impacted by the boundary adjustments. Community feedback sessions were held on May 8, 2023 at Dyer-Kelly Elementary School, May 10, 2023 at Greer Elementary School and on May 16, 2023, held virtually.

The district’s board policy 5116 (BP 5116) establishes procedures for setting, modifying and reviewing its school attendance boundaries. To establish or modify school attendance boundaries, the Superintendent or designee must consider the following factors before making a recommendation to the board for boundary adjustments:  
1. School enrollment data, including declining enrollment patterns;  
2. Facility capacity and design, including potential commercial and residential developments;  
3. School feeder patterns, including maintaining, to the extent practicable, continuity of student attendance;  
4. Federal, state, or court mandates;  
5. Community input;  
6. Student safety;  
7. Transportation capacity;  
8. Community and neighborhood identity;  
9. Geographic features of the district, including traffic patterns;  
10. Educational programs, such as magnet schools and charter schools;  
11. Consistency between municipal boundaries and high school boundaries; and  
12. Other factors.  

As a result of those meetings and the Committee’s work, staff proposes adjusting attendance boundaries at the following middle schools:  
- Arden Middle School;  
- Arcade Fundamental Middle School;  
- Katherine Johnson Middle School;  
- Starr King K-8;  
- Winston Churchill Middle School.  
<!-- Page 828 -->
The proposed boundary changes are depicted on the attached maps. Based on the feedback collected and staff analysis of which map options best met the criteria established by the Committee, the superintendent is recommending the board adopt the boundaries presented in proposed map number three.

With board direction to do so, the next steps on this item would be to provide a resolution for board consideration approving and adopting the proposed boundary adjustments. The resolution would also address the requirements imposed by the California Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) on such actions by local agencies. If the resolution is adopted by the board, these boundary changes would be effective at the start of the 2025-2026 school year.

# Interactive Tool Created for Map Scenarios

The proposed map webpage features the ability to toggle between the three options and each features an address look-up where residents can enter their address to see which middle school would potentially be assigned to their address.
<!-- Page 837 -->
![Outreach: Phase 1](https://example.com/image1)  
- Conducted a ThoughtExchange open to the community in March and April 2023 asking the question: What should we take into consideration as we plan for middle school attendance boundary changes at Arcade, Arden, Katherine Johnson, Starr King and Winston Churchill (to be implemented starting in the 2024-25 school year)?  
- Key themes:  
  - **Boundary Suggestions** - I think it’s important that students within a neighborhood are able to attend their school. For example, we live closer to ECHS, but Mira Loma is our home school. I don’t think my home school should be a school further away from my neighborhood.  
  - **Enrollment** - Don’t feed one elementary school into 2 middle schools. Disrupts the connectedness of the students which is a protective factor for mental health. Can’t take that away in hardest years!  
  - **Student Needs** - Keeping core groups of children, who have attended elementary school, together as they transition into middle school.  
  - **Accelerated Programs/IB** - The IB and special Ed programs should remain unaffected by boundary changes.  
  - **Transportation/Safety** - Work with the county to put up pedestrian crossing lights, crossing guards, or police check points near school bike/walk paths to keep everyone safe.  

![Outreach: Phase 2](https://example.com/image2)  
Outreach around the proposed boundary maps began in late April 2023 via a variety of channels and highlighted the interactive map tool, three community feedback forums and the open-ended feedback form:  
- Mass notification to impacted families and staff at the middle schools and feeder elementary schools (phone call, email and text) in multiple languages.  
- District and school web article announcement.  
- District newsletter articles and social media posts.  
- A communication toolkit was shared with impacted school site leaders to include in their regular school communication channels.  
- Informational flyers (in multiple languages) were shared through the FACE Mobile visits in affected neighborhoods.  
<!-- Page 838 -->
![Outreach: Phase 2](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Outreach:+Phase+2)

- Impacted middle schools hosted a middle school boundary informational table at their open house nights
- Presented at:
  - Superintendent’s Parent Advisory Committee: April 27
  - Facilities Committee: May 2 and June 6
  - District English Learner Advisory Committee: May 25
- Gathered feedback at several community meetings:
  - Monday, May 8 at 6 p.m. - Dyer-Kelly Elementary
  - Wednesday, May 10 at 6 p.m. - Greer Elementary
  - Tuesday, May 16 at 6 p.m. - Virtual meeting option

![Feedback on Maps Through Online Form](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Feedback+on+Maps+Through+Online+Form)

- Have Resident Boundary Student Counts Match School Capacities: “Scenario 3 is the best option to keep borders congruent with neighborhoods and where our future middle school students will already be socially, emotionally and academically integrated. In addition, this option makes the attendance for schools most balanced.”
  
- Keep Neighborhoods Together: “I highly recommend moving forward with Scenario 3. Although it may seem insignificant, including that area between Mission and El Camino in the Arden Middle School Boundary will keep peer groups together. Many of the kids in that small portion have been participating in sports, such as Archer Park soccer, Arden Little League, etc. That small neighborhood area really is seen as part of the Arden Park/ Arden Oaks community and it would be devastating to break up peer groups that have been established going as far back as preschool. PLEASE MOVE FORWARD WITH OPTION 3.”

- Reduce Student Transfer Rates: “I like Plan 3 the best. My daughter attends Arden M.S.; however, our home school is Churchill. Churchill is completely out of our way and Plan 3 is the only one that would have put her into Arden without open enrollment.”

- Walking Distances: “I believe map 3 makes the most sense especially for the Arden MS boundary. It includes some Del Paso Manor which is walkable or bike-able versus the other two maps which includes further areas which are not walkable.”

- Walking Distances: “Only scenario c makes any sense. Johnson is the farthest west and should draw more from the west. The boundaries for Arden middle should include the square surrounded by Watt, El Camino, Eastern, and Arden as that area is far closer to Arden Middle.”

### Enrollment Options

- Families with students who change grade levels, which forces a change in school, will automatically be assigned the new boundary school.
- If the families do not wish to attend the new boundary school, they will participate in Open Enrollment for the 25-26 school year.
<!-- Page 842 -->
![Enrollment Options, Continued](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Enrollment+Options,+Continued)

- Families with students entering a grade that does not force a change in school, and now have a new boundary school, will be able to be placed at the new boundary school prior to Open Enrollment.
- Families with students entering a grade that does not force a change in school, and have a new boundary school, may choose to do nothing and remain in the non-boundary school of choice.
- All other families may participate in Open Enrollment as normal.

---

![Next Steps: Outreach](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Next+Steps:+Outreach)

After the board’s approval of a new middle school boundary map, outreach will be conducted to impacted families in the Fall of 2024:

- Outreach via email, phone call, text message and flyers in multiple languages
- Enrollment workshops during the evening at each impacted middle school prior to open enrollment.

# Encina Preparatory High School’s Proposed Name Change
San Juan Unified School District Board of Education  
June 11, 2024  
Kristan Schnepp, Assistant Superintendent, Secondary Education and Programs  

---

## Background
- As Encina Preparatory High School looks forward to its own campus and upgraded facilities in the coming years, the Encina community explored potentially dropping “Preparatory” from the school’s name, and redesigning the logo.
- Historically, there have been inconsistent references to Encina's official school name, Encina Preparatory High School. Oftentimes, the school community refers to Encina as simply Encina High School, dropping "Preparatory."
- Encina collected feedback from staff, students, parents and guardians to determine a name and logo which best reflects the school community.
<!-- Page 891 -->
![Where we collected feedback](https://via.placeholder.com/993x768.png?text=Where+we+collected+feedback)

- Online ThoughtExchange (March 11 – 22, 2024) with a flex period during school hours for students to participate.
- Staff Meeting and Feedback Form (March 12)

**Encina Vision Statement:**
At Encina High School, we commit to an anti-racist, culturally responsive education that:

- Empowers young adults who will make a difference in our society.
<!-- Page 893 -->
![Slide 7](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Feedback+collected+during+in-person+meetings)

- Students expressed that Encina should drop “Preparatory” from its official name feeling that “preparatory” is not representative of Encina’s vision.
- Some community members perceive “preparatory” to mean “continuation.”
- A majority of staff feedback shared that the “preparatory” does not reflect the school vision.
- The name change was discussed with students during a listening session with Encina students. The majority of the students felt that the “preparatory” in the school name should be removed.

## BOARD OF EDUCATION  

### AGENDA ITEM: 1-6  
### MEETING DATE: 06/11/2024  

**SUBJECT:** Districtwide Dress Code Revision Process  
**DEPARTMENT:** Division of Teaching and Learning  

---

### ACTION REQUESTED:  
The superintendent is recommending that the board hear a report on the process for revising the districtwide dress code.  

### RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:  
Beginning in 2019, the Superintendent's Student Advisory Council (SSAC), along with students across the district, expressed concerns about the current San Juan Unified dress code policy (Board Policy 5132) and the lack of consistency with individual site policies as well as enforcement of the site policies. During the 2020-21 school year, student listening sessions were held to gather feedback. SSAC brought this issue forward as an area of concern in 2020. A student committee was formed and worked in conjunction with SSAC to create a survey, in which 4,500 students participated. Concerns focused on: gender bias, discriminatory language, as well as issues with enforcing the code, which included shaming, missed instructional time, and inconsistent enforcement from staff.  

In the 2022-23 school year, a district committee was formed to draft an updated districtwide dress code. The committee consisted of students, community and families, classified employees, practitioners, and administrators. The committee spent time calibrating their understanding of the problem, researching, and reviewing other district policies and practices. The committee next proposed a draft districtwide dress code and gathered input prior to revising the existing dress code based on feedback.  

In 2023-24, a finalized districtwide dress code was created and was available for public review from April 1, 2024, through May 17, 2024. Once the public review period closed, the committee disseminated the survey information. Approximately 2,000 people provided input via Thoughtexchange. The committee reviewed themes and trends and revised the districtwide dress code.

**Policy 5132: Dress And Grooming**

**Original Adopted Date:** 03/29/2005  
**Last Reviewed Date:** 03/29/2006 06/03/2024  
**Last Revised Date:** 06/03/2024  

The Board of Education believes that appropriate student dress and grooming contribute to a productive learning environment. The Board expects students to give proper attention to personal cleanliness and to wear clothes that are appropriate for a K-12 educational environment, and suitable for the specific school activities in which they participate. Students' clothing must not present a health or safety hazard or create a substantial disruption which would interfere with the educational process program.

Individual schools may establish additional guidelines for its own students, so long as those guidelines are consistent with board policy and administrative regulations. If a school chooses to adopt guidelines, the principal shall include students, parents, and faculty in the formulation of those guidelines. District and school rules pertaining to student attire shall be included on the district website, in student handbooks, may be posted in school offices and classrooms, and may be periodically reviewed with all students as necessary.

Students shall not be prohibited from dressing in a manner consistent with their gender identity or gender expression or with their religious or cultural observance. (Ed Code Section 220, BP 5145.41)

Guidelines must ensure that the dress code does not single out or discriminate against students on the basis of cultural expression, hair texture, hairstyles, religious expression, body type or maturity, gender identity, gender expression, or any other protected right. (Ed Code Section 212.1)

Students and parents shall be informed of the existence of the dress code, related guidelines, and consequences for violations at the time of initial enrollment and at the outset of each school year. (Ed Code Section 220)

The principal or designee is authorized to enforce this policy and shall inform any student who does not reasonably conform to the dress code. School administrators, teachers, and other staff shall be notified of appropriate and equitable enforcement of the dress code. The dress code shall not be enforced in a manner that discriminates against a particular viewpoint or results in a disproportionate application of the dress code based on students’ gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, household income, or body type or size. (Ed Code Section 220)

When practical, students shall not be directed to correct a dress code violation during instructional time or in front of other students. Repeated violations or refusal to comply with the district's dress code may result in disciplinary action.

**Gang Related Attire**

The principal, staff, and parents/guardians at a school may establish a reasonable dress code that prohibits students from wearing gang-related apparel when there is evidence of a gang presence that disrupts or threatens to disrupt the school's activities. Such a proposed dress code shall be presented to the Board, which shall approve the plan upon determining that it is necessary to protect the health and
<!-- Page 915 -->
![Image](https://via.placeholder.com/768x993.png?text=Image+Not+Available)

**safety of the school environment. The dress code policy may be included in the school's comprehensive safety plan. (Education Code 35183)**

**When determining specific items of clothing that may be defined as gang apparel, the school shall ensure that the determination is free from bias based on race, ethnicity, national origin, immigration status, or other protected characteristics.**

**Policy 5132.4: School Uniforms**  
**Original Adopted Date:** 05/23/1995 | **Last Reviewed Date:** 05/23/1995  
**Status:** ADOPTED  

A safe school environment enables students, parents/guardians and staff to focus on education instead of personal safety. Student dress has an impact on school safety and student behavior, and is believed to convey or contribute to the general attitude of students toward school. Individual schools are authorized to adopt a school uniform as part of their dress code, by incorporating such dress code into their school safety plan. The Superintendent is directed to adopt an administrative regulation incorporating the legal requirements for schools wishing to adopt a uniform requirement as part of their dress codes.

### AGENDA ITEM: I-10
### MEETING DATE: 06/11/2024

**SUBJECT:** Public Hearing: Conveyance of Easement  
at Del Paso Manor Elementary School to the Sacramento  
Metropolitan Air Quality Management District  

**DEPARTMENT:** Facilities  

**ACTION REQUESTED:**  
The superintendent is recommending that the board call a public hearing to solicit public comment and adopt Resolution No. 4140 declaring the conveyance of a permanent easement at Del Paso Manor Elementary School to the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District.

**RATIONALE/BACKGROUND:**  
The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District maintains seven air monitoring stations across the county. Since 1979, one of these air monitoring stations has been stationed at 2701 Avalon Drive, Sacramento, on the campus of Del Paso Manor Elementary School located at 2700 Maryal Drive, Sacramento.

The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District has an agreement with the district to install an air monitoring station on the school’s property. The amount of equipment at Del Paso Manor has steadily increased due to stricter Environmental Protection Agency regulations. The existing station configuration can no longer accommodate more equipment without improvements to the building structure. Therefore, the air monitoring station requires renovation and site expansion to accommodate additional equipment.

The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District has already been approved by the district to expand the footprint of the air monitoring station and received approval from the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) to install underground electrical conduit. SMUD needs the district to sign a conveyance of electrical distribution facilities acknowledgement before the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District can start work.

**Easement Request**

**To:** San Juan Unified School District  
**From:** Levi Ford, Air Monitoring Supervisor,  
Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District  
**Date:** April 30, 2024  

**Background:** Since the 1960s, the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (Licensee) has been responsible for monitoring air pollution in Sacramento County. The Licensee maintains seven air monitoring stations across the county. One of these air monitoring stations has been stationed at the Del Paso Manor Elementary School property at 2701 Avalon Drive since 1979.

The licensee had an agreement with San Juan Unified District (District), a California public school, to allow an air monitoring station to be installed on the school’s property. The amount of equipment in Del Paso Manor has steadily increased due to an increase in Environmental Protection Agency regulations and the existing station configuration can no longer accommodate more equipment with improvements to the building structure. The air monitoring station requires renovation and site expansion to accommodate additional equipment.

The District and the Licensee executed air monitoring site agreement number E2019005 to accommodate the expansion for additional space. The effective date of the agreement was July 1, 2019. The term of the agreement was for 5 years and will automatically renew for two additional 5-year terms.

Section 13 of this agreement, “Improvements”, states “With the prior written approval of the District, Licensee may, at its own sole cost and expense, construct or cause to be constructed on the premises those alterations, additions, improvements which the Licensee deems necessary to its permitted uses of the premises, subject to the local site, zoning, and design review and other required approvals….”

Licensee has already been approved by the District to expand the footprint of the air monitoring station and received approval from SMUD to install underground electrical conduit. SMUD needs the property owner to sign a conveyance of electrical distribution facilities acknowledgement before the Licensee can start work.

A. Proposed Change in Compensation (Continued)  

8. What was the negotiated percentage change? For example, if the change in "Year 1" was for less than a full year, what is the annualized percentage of that change for "Year 1"?  
6.98% equivalent ongoing salary increase across the three-year projections  

9. Were any additional steps, columns, or ranges added to the salary schedules? (If yes, please explain.)  
No, but step 1 was eliminated. Eliminating step 1 has almost no impact because it is extremely rare to place an employee there.  

10. Please include comments and explanations as necessary. (If more room is necessary, please attach an additional sheet.)  

11. Does this bargaining unit have a negotiated cap for Health and Welfare benefits?  
Yes ☐ No ☒  
If yes, describe the cap amount.  

B. Proposed negotiated changes in noncompensation items (i.e., class size adjustments, staff development days, teacher prep time, classified staffing ratios, etc.)  
Unit negotiated floating mental health days, remote work, and formalizing its psychologist leadership team.  

C. What are the specific impacts (positive or negative) on instructional and support programs to accommodate the settlement? Include the impact of changes such as staff reductions or increases, program reductions or increases, elimination or expansion of other services or programs (i.e., counselors, librarians, custodial staff, etc.)  
Unit negotiated an estimated 5.5 FTE to add vice principal support.

**D. What contingency language is included in the proposed agreement (e.g., reopeners, etc.)?**  
If the 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level less than 0.5%, and no augmentation is provided to offset the loss of revenue, both parties agree to revisit the potential impact on the multiyear financial health of the district and examine potential cost saving measures. If the enacted California 2024-25 State Budget COLA is funded at a level in excess of 1.5%, or there is an augmentation to the COLA resulting in an increase of revenues beyond the 1.5%, the district and Coalition agree to examine potential enhancements to the salary schedule for Year 1 or Year 2.

**E. Identify other major provisions that do not directly affect the district's costs, such as binding arbitrations, grievance procedures, etc.**  
None.

**F. Source of Funding for Proposed Agreement:**  
1. Current Year  
   Fund balance, restricted and unrestricted funds.

2. If this is a single year agreement, how will the ongoing cost of the proposed agreement be funded in subsequent years?  
   N/A

3. If this is a multiyear agreement, what is the source of funding, including assumptions used, to fund these obligations in subsequent years? (Remember to include compounding effects in meeting obligations.)  
   The district has a robust and healthy ending fund balance. Restricted and unrestricted funds will cover the cost of the agreement across all three years. The district expects to deficit spend from its ending fund balance to cover the cost of the settlement. The deficit spending is manageable even beyond the three year projections. The district will monitor its deficit spending in future years and make adjustments as needed to maintain a healthy ending fund balance.
