Improve the following summary with the following guidelines:

- Avoid fluff languages like "lastly," "notably," and "additionally," to string sentences together. Instead use bullet points.
- Use active voice. Be direct, quantitative, objective, and specific.
- Be concise but thorough. Cut out unnecessary phrases, especially those that don't add value. Replace verbose expressions with more straightforward language.
- Include proper nouns.
- Spell out acronyms the first time, e.g. "California Department of General Services (DGS)"
- Include links to proper nouns and link the whole proper noun as well as the acronym, e.g. [California Department of General Services (DGS)](https://www.dgs.ca.gov/)
- Whenever a report/agreement is accepted or acknowledged, include some details about the report and be quantitative.

Do not omit any important or quantitative information.

Improve the following summary by removing any procedural details that aren't meaningful to community oversight.

For example:
- if there was public comment, include examples of what people said.
- if there was no public comment, then don't mention it in the summary.
- if the board approved the previous meeting notes, omit that from the summary because this is an uneventful detail.
- don't mention how to join on a zoom call or when the next meeting will be.
- don't mention acknowledgements for unrelated things, e.g. "they recognized Breast Cancer Awareness Month".
