Improve the following summary by removing any procedural details that aren't meaningful to the reader.

For example:
- if there was public comment, include examples of what people said.
- if there was no public comment, then don't mention it in the summary.
- if the board approved the previous meeting notes, omit that from the summary because this is an uneventful detail.
- don't include operational details like the time of the board meeting, how to join on a zoom call, or when the next meeting will be. Focus on the contents of the meeting and accompanying documents.
